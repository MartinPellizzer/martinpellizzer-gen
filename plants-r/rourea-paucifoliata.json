It is characterized by its small, opposite leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically borne on short pedicels. Its woody stems are often branched and may have a somewhat succulent texture. Rourea paucifoliata is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories."
