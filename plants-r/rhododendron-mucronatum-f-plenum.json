    "intro": "Rhododendron mucronatum f. plenum, commonly known as the Alpine Rhododendron, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It features dense, leathery leaves that are typically dark green with a slightly pubescent underside. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, fragrant flowers in shades of pink to white, often blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained, acidic soil. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine plantings."
