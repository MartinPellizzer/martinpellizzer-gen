    "intro": "Rubus foliosus var. saltuum, commonly known as the coastal raspberry, is a shrub native to coastal regions of the Pacific Northwest. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, aggregate berries that ripen in late summer. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to salt spray and coastal winds. Its flowering period occurs in early spring, producing white to pink flowers that attract pollinators. This variety is valued for its hardiness and ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes."
