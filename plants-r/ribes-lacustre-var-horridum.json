    "intro": "Ribes lacustre var. horridum, commonly known as the rough-stemmed gooseberry, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its hairy, often glandular stems and leaves, which contribute to its rough texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by edible berries that ripen to a dark red or purple color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. This variety is notable for its ornamental value and its role in supporting local wildlife."
