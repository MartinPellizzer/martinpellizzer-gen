    "intro": "Ranunculus \u00d7 scissus, commonly known as the cutleaf buttercup, is a hybrid perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are deeply lobed and often divided into narrow, serrated segments. The plant produces showy, bright yellow flowers with five petals, typically appearing in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in some regions."
