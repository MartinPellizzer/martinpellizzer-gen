    "intro": "Ranunculus vitifolius, commonly known as the grape-leaved buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features palmately divided, bright green leaves that resemble grape leaves, often with a waxy coating. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with five petals, typically in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in some regions."
