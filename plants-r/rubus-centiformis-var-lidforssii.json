    "intro": "Rubus centiformis var. lidforssii, commonly known as the Lidfors' bramble, is a variant of the many-fruited blackberry native to specific regions of Scandinavia. It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black when ripe. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in forest edges and open woodlands. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within the Rubus genus."
