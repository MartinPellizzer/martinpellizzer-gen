    "intro": "Rubus hedycarpus f. validus, commonly known as the yellow bramble, is a deciduous shrub native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces edible berries that are typically red or black in color, though they are often tart and less commonly consumed compared to other Rubus species. It thrives in moist, woodland soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. The leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the plant is noted for its ornamental value in horticulture."
