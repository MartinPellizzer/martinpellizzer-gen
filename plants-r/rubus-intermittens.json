    "intro": "Rubus intermittens, commonly known as the intermittent blackberry, is a species of brambles native to parts of North America. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black in color. It thrives in moist, wooded areas and is often found in shaded environments. Due to its intermittent blooming pattern, it is less commonly cultivated than other Rubus species."
