    "intro": "Rhododendron \u00d7 kawir, commonly known as the Kawir rhododendron, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Rhododendron kawakamii and Rhododendron sinogrande. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to red. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for shaded garden landscapes. Its ornamental value is further enhanced by its ability to bloom in late spring to early summer."
