    "intro": "Rubus bellardii var. pygmaeomorphus, commonly known as the dwarf blackberry, is a small shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features thorny stems and trifoliate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, dark red berries that are typically less than 1 cm in diameter. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Botanically, it is closely related to other Rubus species but is distinguished by its compact growth habit and unique fruit morphology."
