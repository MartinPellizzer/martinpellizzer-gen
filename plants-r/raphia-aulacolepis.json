It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of broad, feather-like leaves that can reach up to 10 meters in length. The plant produces large, yellowish-orange inflorescences that bear both male and female flowers, facilitating its reproduction. Its leaves are used in traditional crafts and as thatching material, while the fruit is edible and consumed by both humans and wildlife. The species plays an important ecological role in its native habitats, providing shelter and food for various animals."
