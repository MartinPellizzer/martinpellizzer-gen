    "intro": "Rhodamnia dumetorum, commonly known as the coastal hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Australia. It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, often in areas subject to salt spray. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink and white, which bloom from late winter to spring. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a rough texture with a serrated edge. Rhodamnia dumetorum is well adapted to coastal environments and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardiness."
