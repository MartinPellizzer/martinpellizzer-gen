    "intro": "Rumex acetosa subsp. amplexicaulis, commonly known as broad-leaved sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive broad, heart-shaped leaves that often have reddish veins and a sour taste due to high oxalic acid content. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks. Its leaves are sometimes used in cooking, though they should be consumed in moderation due to their acidic nature."
