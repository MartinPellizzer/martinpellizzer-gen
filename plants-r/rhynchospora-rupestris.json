    "intro": "Rhynchospora rupestris, commonly known as the rock marsh sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy environments in North America. It typically grows in compact, grass-like clusters with narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are characteristic of the Cyperaceae family. Rhynchospora rupestris thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and birds."
