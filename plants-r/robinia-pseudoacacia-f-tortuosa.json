    "intro": "Robinia pseudoacacia f. tortuosa, commonly known as the twisted false acacia, is a unique form of the honey locust tree. It is characterized by its serpentine, twisted growth pattern, which gives it a distinctive and ornamental appearance. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval leaflets and produces yellow pea-like flowers in late spring. Its bark is thick, fissured, and exudes a sticky sap when damaged. This variety is often cultivated for its aesthetic value in gardens and parks."
