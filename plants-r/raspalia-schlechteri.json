    "intro": "Raspalia schlechteri, commonly known as the Schlechter's raspalia, is a rare and lesser-known plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and elliptical leaves. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in mountainous forests, where it thrives in the understory. Its botanical features include hairy stems and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in the spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
