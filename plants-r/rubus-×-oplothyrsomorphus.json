It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces aggregate fruits composed of small, dark red to black drupelets. It thrives in temperate climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Due to its vigorous growth and fruit quality, it is widely cultivated for both commercial and home gardening purposes."
