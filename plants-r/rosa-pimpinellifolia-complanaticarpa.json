    "intro": "Rosa pimpinellifolia complanaticarpa, commonly known as the flat-leaf rock rose, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and is native to arid and rocky regions of the Mediterranean. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and often have a distinctive, flat or compressed shape, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in challenging soil conditions."
