    "intro": "Rosa spuria var. marisensis, commonly known as the sea rose, is a low-growing shrub native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender stems and small, fragrant pink or white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is well adapted to salty sea air and coastal winds. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Rosa spuria var. marisensis is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
