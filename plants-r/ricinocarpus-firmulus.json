    "intro": "Ricinocarpus firmulus, commonly known as the slender sea bean, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Malvaceae. It is a halophyte, meaning it thrives in saline environments such as coastal areas and estuaries. The plant is characterized by its slender, woody stems and small, palmate leaves that help reduce water loss in salty conditions. Its flowers are typically small and yellow, arranged in clusters, and it produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds. Ricinocarpus firmulus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms."
