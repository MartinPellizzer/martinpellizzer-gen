    "intro": "Rhynchosia affinis, commonly known as the African butterbean, is a tropical legume native to Africa and parts of Asia. It is a climbing vine with trifoliate leaves and produces small, yellow flowers followed by bean-like pods. The plant is characterized by its distinctive, elongated seeds that are often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fallow fields. Rhynchosia affinis is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it useful in agricultural systems."
