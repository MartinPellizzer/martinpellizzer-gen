    "intro": "Rhabdia lycioides, commonly known as the desert morning glory, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Convolvulaceae family, characterized by its climbing habit and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Rhabdia lycioides is adapted to survive in low-nutrient soils and can tolerate extreme temperature fluctuations."
