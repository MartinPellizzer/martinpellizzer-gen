    "intro": "Rottlera gigantea, commonly known as the giant rottlera, is a striking plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, glossy, elliptical leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom during the wet season. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for tropical gardens and indoor spaces. Rottlera gigantea thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
