    "intro": "Rosa afzeliana var. berniciensis, commonly known as the Bernician rose, is a shrub native to the British Isles, particularly found in coastal areas of England and Wales. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and dark green, lobed leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers in late spring to early summer. Its fruits are red, hairy rosehips that persist into winter, providing food for birds and other wildlife. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological importance in coastal habitats."
