    "intro": "Rubus stipulatus, commonly known as the stipulate blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with stipules, which are small, leaf-like structures at the base of the leaf stalks. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically black when ripe, though they may also be red or white depending on the variety. It thrives in moist, wooded areas and is often found in the understory of forests. The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and its role in supporting local wildlife."
