    "intro": "Relhania tricephala, commonly known as the three-headed relhania, is a species of flowering plant native to the rainforests of South America. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many economically important plants such as coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is typically found in the understory of dense tropical forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
