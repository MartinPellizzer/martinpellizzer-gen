    "intro": "Rubus sulcatus var. divergens, commonly known as the alpine blackberry, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and thorny stems, which help it anchor to rocky substrates. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically consumed by birds and other wildlife. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated margins and a hairy texture. Botanically, it is notable for its ability to thrive in harsh, high-altitude environments."
