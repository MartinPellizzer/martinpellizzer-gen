    "intro": "Rebutia heliosa, commonly known as the sun rose, is a succulent plant native to South America. It is characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water, enabling it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. Its leaves are small and rounded, often covered in a fine, powdery coating. Rebutia heliosa is well-suited for rock gardens and requires full sun to flourish."
