    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 horrendus, commonly known as the devil's raspberry. This hybrid plant is a result of crossbreeding between various species of the Rubus genus, which includes raspberries and blackberries. It is characterized by its thorny stems and aggregate fruits that resemble raspberries in appearance. The plant typically grows in temperate regions and thrives in well-drained soils. Due to its vigorous growth and potential invasiveness, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural settings."
