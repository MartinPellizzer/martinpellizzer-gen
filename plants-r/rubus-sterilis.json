    "intro": "Rubus sterilis, commonly known as the sterile blackberry, is a species of shrub in the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its prickly stems and small, usually non-fruiting, flowers. The plant typically grows in woodland areas and is native to parts of Europe and western Asia. Unlike its fruit-bearing relatives, Rubus sterilis does not produce edible berries. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study."
