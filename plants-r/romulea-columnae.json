    "intro": "Romulea columnae, commonly known as the columnar romulea, is a bulbous perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features a distinctive, elongated bulb that resembles a column, from which grass-like leaves and clusters of delicate, bell-shaped flowers emerge. The flowers are typically yellow or orange, with a spurred petal at the base, and bloom in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. This plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
