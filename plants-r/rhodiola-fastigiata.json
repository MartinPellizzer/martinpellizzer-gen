    "intro": "Rhodiola fastigiata, commonly known as the compact rhodiola, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Crassulaceae family and is characterized by its dense, rosette-like growth habit. The plant features fleshy, often blue-green leaves that are covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in its arid environment. Its flowers are typically pink or red, arranged in clusters at the top of the stems. Rhodiola fastigiata is adapted to cold climates and is often found at high altitudes where it thrives in rocky or gravelly soils."
