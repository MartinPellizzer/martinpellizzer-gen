    "intro": "Rhamnus zonulata, commonly known as the zigzag buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves with a distinctive zigzag pattern along the midrib, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by reddish-black berries that are a food source for various birds and mammals. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands and along streambanks. The species is also notable for its use in traditional herbal medicine."
