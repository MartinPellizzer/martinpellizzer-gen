    "intro": "Rauvolfia psychotrioides, commonly known as the Indian snakeroot, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Asia, particularly India and Sri Lanka. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring opposite, elliptical leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters along the stems. Its roots are the primary part used in traditional medicine, containing alkaloids such as reserpine, which have been historically used for their hypotensive properties. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forested areas."
