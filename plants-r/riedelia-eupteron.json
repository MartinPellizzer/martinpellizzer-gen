It features a compact, rounded stem with bright yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. It prefers full sun and well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its striking appearance makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and succulent collections."
