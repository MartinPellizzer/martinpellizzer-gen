    "intro": "Rhododendron nitidulum var. nitidulum, commonly known as the glossy rhododendron, is a species native to the eastern Himalayas and southern China. It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its dense, leathery foliage that remains glossy throughout the growing season. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, pink to white flowers in the spring, which are borne on pedicels. Its leaves are typically elliptical, with a smooth margin and a pointed tip, and they are arranged in whorls around the stems. This variety is well adapted to acidic, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade in its natural habitat."
