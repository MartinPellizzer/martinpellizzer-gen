It is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette of silver-gray, sword-shaped leaves. The leaves are covered in a dense layer of fine, white trichomes that give the plant its distinctive appearance. This plant is often cultivated as an ornamental due to its unique foliage and ability to thrive in shaded environments. It also plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and moisture retention in its native habitat."
