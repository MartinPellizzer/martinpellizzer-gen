    "intro": "Rumex nemolapathum var. sanguineus, commonly known as the red-stemmed sorrel, is a variant of the sorrel genus characterized by its distinctive reddish stems. It is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia, typically found in moist, temperate habitats. The plant features alternate, heart-shaped leaves with a serrated margin and a reddish or purple underside. Its flowers are small and clustered in spikes, producing seeds that are dispersed by wind. The leaves contain oxalic acid, making them edible but requiring thorough cooking before consumption."
