    "intro": "Ranunculus trichophyllus subsp. trichophylloides, commonly known as the hairyleaf buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features delicate, palmately lobed leaves covered in fine hairs, which give it its common name. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
