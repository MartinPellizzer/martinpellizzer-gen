    "intro": "Rhododendron cloiophorum subsp. roseotinctum, commonly known as the pink-stained rhododendron, is a rare and striking subshrub native to the Himalayas. It is characterized by its vibrant, showy flowers that range from pale pink to deep rose, often with a distinctive red or purple tinge. The plant typically grows in high-altitude regions, thriving in cool, moist environments with acidic soil. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, providing a striking contrast to the colorful blooms. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
