    "intro": "Ricinus communis f. exiguus, commonly known as the dwarf castor plant, is a compact variant of the castor oil plant. It is characterized by its small, hairy leaves and reduced stature compared to the standard castor plant. This form is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its unique appearance. The plant produces spiny capsules containing toxic seeds, similar to the parent species. It thrives in warm climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
