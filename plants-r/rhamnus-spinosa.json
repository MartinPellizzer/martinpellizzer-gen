    "intro": "Rhamnus spinosa, commonly known as the thorned buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and western Asia. It typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters and is characterized by its spiny branches and small, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces small greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by dark blue berries that are edible for birds and some mammals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges, hedgerows, and rocky areas. Rhamnus spinosa is also valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in traditional medicine."
