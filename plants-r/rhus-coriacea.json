    "intro": "Rhus coriacea, commonly known as the roughleaf sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 5 to 11 pairs of ovate to elliptical leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in panicles, followed by red, fuzzy fruits that are an important food source for wildlife. Its bark is rough and fissured, and it often has a reddish or brownish hue. Rhus coriacea is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed areas."
