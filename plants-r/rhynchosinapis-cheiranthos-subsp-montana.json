It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in dry, rocky habitats. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or purple in color. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. It plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining ecological balance in its native range."
