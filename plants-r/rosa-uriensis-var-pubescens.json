    "intro": "Rosa uriensis var. pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent sand rose, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has hairy (pubescent) stems and leaves, which give it its botanical variety name. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or coastal landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its attractive foliage and seasonal interest throughout the year."
