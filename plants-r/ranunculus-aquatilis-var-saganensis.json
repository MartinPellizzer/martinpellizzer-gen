    "intro": "Ranunculus aquatilis var. saganensis, commonly known as the Sagan's water buttercup, is a variant of the water buttercup native to freshwater habitats in Europe. It is characterized by its delicate, yellow flowers with five petals and a hairy, green stem. The plant typically grows in shallow waters, such as ponds and streams, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its leaves are alternate, heart-shaped, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. This variant is notable for its ecological role in supporting aquatic insect populations and maintaining water ecosystem balance."
