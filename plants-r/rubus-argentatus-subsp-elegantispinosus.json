    "intro": "Rubus argentatus subsp. elegantispinosus, commonly known as the silverleaf blackberry, is a shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its silvery-white undersides on its leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, dark red berries that are typically edible but have a tart flavor. Its stems are armed with stout, curved prickles, and the leaves are usually trifoliate with serrated edges. This subspecies is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks."
