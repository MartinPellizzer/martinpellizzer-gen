    "intro": "Rubus pensilvanicus var. frondosus, commonly known as the Pennsylvania blackberry, is a species of bramble native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its thorny stems, trifoliate leaves, and aggregate fruits that mature to a dark purple or black color. The plant typically grows in woodland areas, along stream banks, and in moist, well-drained soils. It produces small white flowers in the spring, which are followed by the edible berries in late summer. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in traditional herbal remedies."
