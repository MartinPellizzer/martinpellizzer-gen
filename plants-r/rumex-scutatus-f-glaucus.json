    "intro": "Rumex scutatus f. glaucus, commonly known as the glaucous dock, is a variant of the broad-leaved dock. It is characterized by its distinctive, broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a whitish, waxy coating. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is found in temperate regions. It produces small, greenish flowers arranged in dense clusters. The glaucous appearance of its foliage is due to the presence of a powdery bloom, which helps to reduce water loss."
