    "intro": "Rhodax origanifolius var. glaber, commonly known as the glabrous rhodax, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, though the 'glaber' variety is notable for its smooth, hairless foliage. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens despite its limited commercial availability."
