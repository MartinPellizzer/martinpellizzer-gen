    "intro": "Rhodanthe psammophila, commonly known as the sand-plain rhodanthe, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, often in arid or semi-arid regions. The plant produces showy, pink or red flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in dry conditions. Rhodanthe psammophila is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing sand dunes and preventing soil erosion."
