    "intro": "Rubus plicatus var. affinis, commonly known as the common blackberry, is a species of bramble that is native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems, trifoliate leaves, and aggregate fruits that develop from multiple small drupes. The plant typically grows in hedgerows, woodland edges, and other disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its flowers are white or pale pink and are followed by the familiar black or dark purple berries that are edible when ripe. This variety is closely related to other Rubus species and is often confused with similar blackberry types due to its similar appearance and growth habits."
