    "intro": "Rhododendron anthopogon subsp. hypenanthum, commonly known as the Himalayan rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Asia, particularly in Nepal, Bhutan, and northern India. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments at high altitudes, often in temperate forests. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, with a waxy coating that helps it retain moisture in its cool, humid habitat. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological diversity of its native ecosystems."
