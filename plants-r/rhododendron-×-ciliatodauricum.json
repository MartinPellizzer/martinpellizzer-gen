    "intro": "Rhododendron \u00d7 ciliatodauricum, commonly known as the Ciliate-leaved Rhododendron, is a hybrid plant that exhibits a mix of characteristics from its parent species, Rhododendron ciliatum and Rhododendron dauricum. It is a deciduous shrub with dense, dark green foliage that turns reddish in the fall. The plant produces showy, clustered flowers in shades of pink to purple, typically blooming in late spring. Its leaves are hairy beneath, giving it the \"ciliate\" designation, and it thrives in acidic, well-drained soil. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes."
