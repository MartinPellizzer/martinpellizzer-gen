    "intro": "Rubus tchalussicus, commonly known as the Siberian raspberry, is a species of bramble native to eastern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or yellow in color. The plant produces white or pink flowers in the spring, which are followed by the development of its edible berries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or along stream banks. The berries are used in local cuisines and have also been studied for their potential medicinal properties."
