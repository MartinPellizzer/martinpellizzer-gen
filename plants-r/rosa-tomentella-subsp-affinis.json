    "intro": "Rosa tomentella subsp. affinis, commonly known as the woolly rose, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and thorny stems, which provide protection against herbivores and harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are simple, ovate, and covered in a fine, white pubescence that gives it a distinctive appearance. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
