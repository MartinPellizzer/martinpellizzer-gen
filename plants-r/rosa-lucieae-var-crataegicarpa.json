    "intro": "Rosa lucieae var. crataegicarpa, commonly known as the Crataegus-bearing rose, is a rare and unique hybrid plant that combines characteristics of roses and hawthorns. It is a shrub with small, clustered flowers that display a range of colors from white to pink. The plant has woody stems and compound leaves, typical of both rose and hawthorn species. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland or shrubland habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a botanical curiosity and of interest to plant taxonomists."
