It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black in color, though the variety cinereus is noted for its lighter, sometimes whitish appearance. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in rocky or dry soils. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is cultivated in some regions for both horticultural and culinary purposes."
