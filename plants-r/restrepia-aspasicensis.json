    "intro": "Restrepia aspasicensis, commonly known as the Aspasicense orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the high-altitude regions of Colombia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and intricate floral structures. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, often arranged in a racemose inflorescence. Its leaves are typically leathery and arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to its harsh, mountainous environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
