    "intro": "Rubus serpens var. tephrodes, commonly known as the silverleaf blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to parts of North America. It is characterized by its silvery-white undersides on its leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, dark berries that are typically edible but less commonly cultivated than other blackberry varieties. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or disturbed areas. The plant has a trailing growth habit and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature."
