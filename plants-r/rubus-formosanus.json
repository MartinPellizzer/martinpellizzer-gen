    "intro": "Rubus formosanus, commonly known as the Taiwan raspberry, is a species of bramble native to eastern Asia, particularly Taiwan. It belongs to the Rubus genus within the Rosaceae family, which includes other raspberries and blackberries. The plant is characterized by its thorny stems, trifoliate leaves, and aggregate fruits composed of small drupelets. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream sides. The flowers are usually white or pale pink, and the fruit is edible, though often tart and less commercially cultivated compared to other raspberry varieties."
