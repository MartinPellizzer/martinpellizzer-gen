It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of large, fan-shaped leaves that can reach up to 5 meters in diameter. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into clustered, fibrous fruits. Its leaves are often used in traditional crafts and as thatching material. Raphia gabonica plays an important ecological role in its native habitats by providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
