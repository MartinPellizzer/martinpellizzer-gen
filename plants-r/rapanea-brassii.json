    "intro": "Rapanea brassii, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Lauraceae, which includes other aromatic and ornamental plants. The plant is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. Its wood is highly valued for its rich, reddish-brown color and fine grain, making it a sought-after material in woodworking. However, due to overharvesting, it is also considered a vulnerable species in its natural habitat."
