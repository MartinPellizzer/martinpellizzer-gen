It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or black when mature. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species in its native habitat."
