    "intro": "Rubus abietinus var. austrinobavaricus, commonly known as the Alpine blackberry, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically harvested in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and cooler climates, often growing at high altitudes. Due to its hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value and edible fruits."
