    "intro": "Ritchiea boukokoensis, commonly known as the Boukoko cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the rainforests of Cameroon. It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of feathery, pinnate leaves. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of cycads. Due to its restricted habitat and threats from deforestation, Ritchiea boukokoensis is considered critically endangered."
