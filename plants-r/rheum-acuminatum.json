    "intro": "Rheum acuminatum, commonly known as Chinese rhubarb, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its large, rhomboid-shaped leaves that are covered in a thick, waxy cuticle. The plant produces tall, reddish stems with clusters of small, yellowish flowers. Its roots are the primary part used in traditional medicine and as a source of the compound rhein. Rheum acuminatum is known for its medicinal properties, particularly in treating constipation and as a mild purgative."
