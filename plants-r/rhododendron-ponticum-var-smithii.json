    "intro": "Rhododendron ponticum var. smithii, commonly known as the Smith's Rhododendron, is a vigorous evergreen shrub native to the Caucasus region. It features large, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and glossy, providing dense foliage. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to red, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is often considered a problematic species in certain regions."
