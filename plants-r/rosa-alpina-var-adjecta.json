    "intro": "Rosa alpina var. adjecta, commonly known as the alpine rose, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its compact growth habit and cold-hardy nature, thriving in alpine and subalpine environments. The plant produces fragrant, pink to white flowers in late spring to early summer, which are typically borne on slender pedicels. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Rosa alpina var. adjecta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover in cooler climates."
