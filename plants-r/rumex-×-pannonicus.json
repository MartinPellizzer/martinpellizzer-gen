    "intro": "Rumex \u00d7 pannonicus, commonly known as the common dock, is a hybrid plant species within the Polygonaceae family. It is characterized by its broad, waxy leaves that are typically heart-shaped and have a serrated edge. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are borne on slender, branched stalks. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies. Rumex \u00d7 pannonicus is known for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes, making it a persistent and sometimes invasive species in certain environments."
