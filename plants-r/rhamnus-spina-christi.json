It is characterized by its small, spiny leaves and yellowish flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible but often bitter. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, demonstrating adaptability to harsh conditions. Its name is derived from its association with the thorns of the Crown of Thorns, a symbol in Christian tradition."
