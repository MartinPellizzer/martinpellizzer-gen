It is a small, herbaceous annual plant characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and small, white or yellowish flowers. Native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula, it thrives in moist, calcareous soils near streams and springs. The plant's leaves are edible and have a peppery flavor, similar to other watercress species. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates."
