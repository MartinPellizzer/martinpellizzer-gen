    "intro": "Ranunculus aquatilis var. terrestris, commonly known as the terrestrial water crowfoot, is a flowering plant native to wetland and aquatic environments. It features delicate, trifoliate leaves that are often submerged or floating on the water's surface. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers with five petals, typically appearing in late spring to early summer. It thrives in shallow, still waters and is often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Due to its preference for moist conditions, it plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various invertebrates."
