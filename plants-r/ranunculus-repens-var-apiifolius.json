    "intro": "Ranunculus repens var. apiifolius, commonly known as the lesser water buttercup, is a low-growing perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically thrives in moist, often calcareous soils along stream banks, wet meadows, and marshy areas. The plant features a trailing stem with alternate, palmately compound leaves that are often lobed and resemble those of the carrot (hence its common name). Its flowers are yellow with 5\u20137 sepals and numerous stamens, blooming in spring. It is an important plant in wetland ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and small mammals."
