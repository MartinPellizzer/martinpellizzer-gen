    "intro": "Ricinus communis subsp. africanus, commonly known as the African castor plant, is a perennial shrub native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves and distinctive spiny capsules that contain toxic seeds. The plant produces a milky latex that has been historically used in various traditional applications. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils. Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and potentially hazardous due to the toxic properties of its seeds."
