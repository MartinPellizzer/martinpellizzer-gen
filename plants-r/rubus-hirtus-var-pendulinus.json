It is characterized by its slender, trailing stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black in color when mature. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the flowers are white with five petals. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and edible fruits."
