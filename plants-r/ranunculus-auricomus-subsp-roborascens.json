    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus subsp. roborascens, commonly known as the robust buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features basal leaves that are deeply lobed and often covered in fine hairs, while its stems are upright and branched. The plant produces showy yellow flowers with five petal-like sepals, which are typically larger than the true petals. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The subspecies is distinguished by its more robust growth habit compared to the typical form of Ranunculus auricomus."
