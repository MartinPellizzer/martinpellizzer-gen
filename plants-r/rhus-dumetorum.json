    "intro": "Rhus dumetorum, commonly known as poison oak, is a shrub native to western North America. It belongs to the Anacardiaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves with three leaflets, often arranged in a spiral pattern. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by red, fuzzy berries. It contains urushiol, a toxic oil that can cause severe skin irritation in humans. Due to its allergenic properties, it is often avoided or managed carefully in natural and agricultural settings."
