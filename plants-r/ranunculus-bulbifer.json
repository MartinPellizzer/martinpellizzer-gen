    "intro": "Ranunculus bulbifer, commonly known as the bulbous buttercup, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its showy, delicate flowers that typically range in color from white to yellow and sometimes pink. The plant produces bulb-like structures called bulbils, which are used for vegetative propagation. These bulbils are often found at the base of the leaves or on the stems. Ranunculus bulbifer thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks."
