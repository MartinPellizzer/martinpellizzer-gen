It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by edible, fleshy fruits containing a single seed. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and potential ecological role in its native habitat. The plant is also valued for its hard, heavy wood, which is used in traditional craftsmanship."
