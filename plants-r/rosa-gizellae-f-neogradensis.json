It is characterized by its compact growth habit and vibrant, semi-double pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Its foliage is dark green and glossy, adding visual interest throughout the growing season. Due to its limited distribution and unique ornamental features, it is highly valued in specialized horticultural collections."
