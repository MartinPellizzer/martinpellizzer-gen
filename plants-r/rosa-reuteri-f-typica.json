It features small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has dark green, glossy leaves and produces hips that are reddish-brown when mature. It is well-suited for rock gardens and coastal areas due to its drought tolerance and salt resistance. Its horticultural value lies in its ornamental flowers and adaptability to various growing conditions."
