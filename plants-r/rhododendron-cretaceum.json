    "intro": "Rhododendron cretaceum, commonly known as the Cretaceous rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is characterized by its evergreen leaves, which are leathery and dark green with a distinctive waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring. It prefers cool, moist environments and thrives in acidic, well-drained soils. Due to its historical significance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical studies."
