It features a dense cluster of cylindrical, ribbed stems that are typically green to bluish-green in color. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the summer months, which are borne on short, hairy pedicels. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments. It is prized for its ornamental value and ease of care in succulent gardens."
