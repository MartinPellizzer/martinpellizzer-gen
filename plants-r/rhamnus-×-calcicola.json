    "intro": "Rhamnus \u00d7 calcicola, commonly known as the Mediterranean buckthorn, is a hybrid shrub that exhibits characteristics of its parent species, Rhamnus alaternus and Rhamnus litoralis. It is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in rocky, well-drained soils, often found in coastal and limestone areas. The plant produces small, dark blue berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Its leaves are typically elliptical with a leathery texture and a distinctive midrib, and it is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value. Rhamnus \u00d7 calcicola is also valued for its ability to stabilize soils and prevent erosion in marginal environments."
