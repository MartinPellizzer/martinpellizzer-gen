    "intro": "Rothmannia macrocarpa, commonly known as the yellow bell, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers that resemble bells, which bloom in late summer. The plant is a shrub or small tree, typically growing up to 3 meters tall, with dark green, glossy leaves. Its flowers are borne in clusters at the ends of branches, and it produces small, woody capsules as fruit. Rothmannia macrocarpa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to well-drained, sandy soils."
