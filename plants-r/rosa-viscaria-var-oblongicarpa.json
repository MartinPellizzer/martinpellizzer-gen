    "intro": "Rosa viscaria var. oblongicarpa, commonly known as the woolly rose, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, fuzzy grayish-white hairs covering the stems and leaves, which provide insulation against cold temperatures. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, pink to red flowers in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a serrated margin, while the fruits are aggregate berries that mature to a dark red color. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in harsh climates."
