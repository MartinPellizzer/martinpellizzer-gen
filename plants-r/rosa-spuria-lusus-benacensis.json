    "intro": "Rosa spuria lusus benacensis, commonly known as the Benacian wild rose, is a rare and endemic species native to specific regions of Croatia. It is a shrub with thorny stems and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces red or pink hips, which are the fruiting bodies containing seeds. It thrives in rocky or coastal environments and is adapted to saline and well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
