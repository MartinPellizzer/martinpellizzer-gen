    "intro": "Rubus cambrensis, commonly known as the Welsh bramble, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is native to western Europe, particularly found in the British Isles, including Wales, where it gets its name. The plant is a shrub with thorny stems and produces small, aggregate fruits known as berries. Its leaves are typically trifoliate, with a serrated edge, and it flowers with white or pale pink flowers in the spring. The Welsh bramble is adapted to a variety of soil types and can thrive in woodland or hedgerow environments."
