    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus subsp. orbifolius, commonly known as the golden shield buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It features bright yellow flowers with five to eight petals, typically blooming in early spring. The leaves are palmately divided, with a distinctive waxy coating that gives them a shiny appearance. This subspecies is characterized by its orbicular (round) leaf shape, which distinguishes it from other ranunculus species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories and along stream banks."
