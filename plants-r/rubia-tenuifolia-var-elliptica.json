It features thin, elongated leaves that are typically elliptical in shape, giving it its varietal name. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale green, arranged in clusters along the stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its botanical significance lies in its use in traditional medicine and as a source of natural dyes."
