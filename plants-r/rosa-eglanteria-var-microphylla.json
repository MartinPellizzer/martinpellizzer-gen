    "intro": "Rosa eglanteria var. microphylla, commonly known as the shrub rose or rose of Sharon, is a species native to China. It is characterized by its dense, thorny growth and small, dark green leaves. The plant produces showy, pink or white flowers in late summer, which are often followed by red, fuzzy fruits. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for hedges and ornamental gardens."
