    "intro": "Rourea coriacea, commonly known as the roughleaf rourea, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish pubescence. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellowish in color, clustered in umbels. Its woody stems and dense foliage make it a popular choice for use in hedges and ornamental landscaping. Rourea coriacea is relatively drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils."
