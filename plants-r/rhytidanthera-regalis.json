    "intro": "Rhytidanthera regalis, commonly known as the royal rhytidanthera, is a rare and striking orchid native to the rainforests of Australia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink and white, with intricate patterns on the petals. The plant has a tall, erect stem that can reach up to 1 meter in height, supporting a cluster of blooms. Its leaves are elongated and grass-like, often growing in a rosette pattern at the base of the plant. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
