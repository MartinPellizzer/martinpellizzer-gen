    "intro": "Rosa canina var. affinis, commonly known as the dog rose variant affinis, is a shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems, pinnate leaves, and fragrant pink or white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces aggregate fruits, known as rose hips, which are rich in vitamin C. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often found in hedgerows and woodland edges. This variety is closely related to the common dog rose, Rosa canina, and shares similar horticultural and ecological traits."
