    "intro": "Rubus alterniflorus subsp. phyllanthoides, commonly known as the silverleaf blackberry, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its finely hairy, silvery-gray leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible, dark red berries in the summer. Its stems are thorny, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. This subspecies is often found in woodland edges and along stream banks."
