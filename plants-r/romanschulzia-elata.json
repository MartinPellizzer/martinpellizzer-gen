    "intro": "Romanschulzia elata, commonly known as the desert lily, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and yellow. The plant has a robust, succulent stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a waxy layer to reduce water loss. Romanschulzia elata blooms during the warmer months, typically from late spring to early autumn."
