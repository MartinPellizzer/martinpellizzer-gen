    "intro": "Rosa loenquistiorum, commonly known as the Loenquist rose, is a rare and delicate species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers that range in color from pale pink to white, often with a subtle red hue at the base. The plant produces narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, velvety texture. Its growth habit is typically shrub-like, with multiple stems that can reach heights of up to 1 meter. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, Rosa loenquistiorum is considered a species of conservation concern."
