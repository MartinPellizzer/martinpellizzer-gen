    "intro": "Ranunculus simensis var. soanensis, commonly known as the Himalayan buttercup, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of the Himalayas. It features showy, yellow flowers with five to eight petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has a short, hairy stem that branches near the base, supporting the clustered flower heads. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a distinctive waxy coating that helps reduce water loss in high-altitude environments. This variant is notable for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant floral display."
