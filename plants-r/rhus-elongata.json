    "intro": "Rhus elongata, commonly known as the narrowleaf sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and have 11 to 23 leaflets. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by red, fuzzy fruits that mature in the fall. Rhus elongata thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in woodland edges, thickets, and disturbed areas. Its botanical features make it a valuable plant for ecological studies and native landscaping."
