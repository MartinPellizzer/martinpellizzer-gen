    "intro": "Rhynchospora glomerata var. typica, commonly known as the clustered spike sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments in North America. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical inflorescence composed of small, spike-like clusters of pale green to brownish flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, and its rhizomes help it spread vegetatively. It has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually arranged in a tight rosette at the base. This species plays an important role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
