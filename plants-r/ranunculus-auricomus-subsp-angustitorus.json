    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus subsp. angustitorus, commonly known as the narrowleaf buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features delicate, yellow flowers with five petals and is often found in moist meadows and woodland edges. The plant has finely divided, trifoliate leaves that are typically narrower than those of the typical subspecies. It blooms from late spring to early summer and is known for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens despite its potential to become invasive in certain regions."
