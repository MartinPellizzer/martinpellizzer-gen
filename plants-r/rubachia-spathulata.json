    "intro": "Rubachia spathulata, commonly known as the broad-leafed bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It features lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, fuzzy texture. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue or violet, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance, it is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
