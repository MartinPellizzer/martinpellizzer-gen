It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring thorny stems and pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces fragrant, pink to red flowers in late spring to early summer, which are followed by oval, red-orange hips. Its botanical characteristics include narrow, serrated leaflets and a preference for well-drained, acidic soils. Rosa angustiarum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and historical use in herbal medicine."
