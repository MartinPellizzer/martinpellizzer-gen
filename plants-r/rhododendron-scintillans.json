    "intro": "Rhododendron scintillans, commonly known as the flame azalea, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its clusters of showy, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange, often with a yellow throat. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters and produces elliptical, dark green leaves that are glossy and leathery. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. The species is known for its early spring blooming period, adding vibrant color to the landscape before the leaves fully emerge."
