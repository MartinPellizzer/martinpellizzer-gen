    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus subsp. pilulatus, commonly known as the yellow pond-lily, is a aquatic flowering plant characterized by its striking yellow petals and heart-shaped leaves. It typically grows in shallow, still waters such as ponds and lakes, where it thrives in sunny conditions. The plant has a short, stout stem that supports its floating leaves and showy flowers, which bloom in early summer. Its subspecies, pilulatus, is distinguished by its slightly different leaf morphology and floral structure compared to the main species. This plant plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various water organisms."
