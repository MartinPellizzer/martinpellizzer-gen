    "intro": "Rhytidophyllum leucomallon, commonly known as the white-spotted cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species belonging to the Cycadaceae family. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feathery leaves that can reach up to two meters in length. The plant produces cycad-like cones, with the male cones being cylindrical and the female cones ovoid, both typically appearing at the base of the plant. It is native to the island of Madagascar and is adapted to grow in dry, rocky soils with minimal rainfall. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and over-collection."
