    "intro": "Ritchiea reflexa, commonly known as the reflexed cycad, is a unique species of cycad native to the island of New Guinea. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and a crown of large, pinnately compound leaves that are reflexed, or bent backward, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically pollinated by insects. Ritchiea reflexa is a slow-growing plant that thrives in humid, shaded environments with well-drained soil. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
