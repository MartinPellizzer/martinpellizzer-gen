    "intro": "Rubus scaber subsp. scabriformis, commonly known as the rough-stemmed blackberry, is a shrub native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its densely hairy stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, rugged appearance. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black in color. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges or disturbed soils. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated for its edible fruits and ornamental value."
