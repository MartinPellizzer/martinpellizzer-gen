It typically grows to a height of about 10-20 cm, with narrow, grass-like leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and is often found in shallow water or damp soil. It plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various insects and small aquatic organisms."
