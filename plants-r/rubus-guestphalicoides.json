    "intro": "Rubus guestphalicoides, commonly known as the ghostly raspberry, is a rare and elusive shrub native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, biennial growth habit. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or yellow in color, which are often consumed by local wildlife. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it thrives in cool, humid climates with well-drained soil. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
