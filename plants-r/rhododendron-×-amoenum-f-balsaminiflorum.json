    "intro": "Rhododendron \u00d7 amoenum f. balsaminiflorum, commonly known as the \"Balsam-flowered Azalea,\" is a hybrid plant that combines traits from rhododendrons and azaleas. It is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to red, resembling those of the balsam plant. The plant typically grows as an evergreen shrub, with dense, leathery foliage that provides a lush backdrop for its blooms. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its early spring flowering and compact growth habit."
