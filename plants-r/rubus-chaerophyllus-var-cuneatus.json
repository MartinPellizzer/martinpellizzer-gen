It is a shrub characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves that are typically narrow and ovate in shape. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that ripen to a dark purple or black color, often with a sweet and tart flavor. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and wild areas."
