    "intro": "Roegneria glaucifolia, commonly known as the bluegrass wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and compact growth habit, making it a popular choice for ornamental and low-maintenance landscapes. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in prairie and steppe habitats. Its drought tolerance and ability to form dense mats make it ecologically valuable in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife."
