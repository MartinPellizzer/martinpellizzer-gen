    "intro": "Rumex \u00d7 scandicus, commonly known as the common sorrel, is a hybrid plant that exhibits characteristics of both Rumex acetosa and Rumex acetobatus. It is a perennial herb with a distinctive heart-shaped leaf that is often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on slender stalks. It thrives in moist, nitrogen-rich soils and is often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Due to its hybrid nature, it can exhibit variability in its morphology and growth habits."
