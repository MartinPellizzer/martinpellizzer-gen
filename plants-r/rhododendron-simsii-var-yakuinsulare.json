    "intro": "Rhododendron simsii var. yakuinsulare, commonly known as the Yaku Island Rhododendron, is a compact evergreen shrub native to Japan. It features dense, leathery leaves that are typically dark green with a glossy surface. The plant produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink and white, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to form dense thickets, providing both visual appeal and habitat for small wildlife."
