    "intro": "Rosa albicans var. flexicaulis, commonly known as the flexible white rose, is a rare and ornamental species native to certain regions of Asia. It is characterized by its pale pink to white flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, arching stems that give it a graceful appearance, and its leaves are compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets. It prefers well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for garden cultivation in temperate climates. Due to its rarity, it is often sought after by horticulturists and botanists for its unique beauty and genetic value."
