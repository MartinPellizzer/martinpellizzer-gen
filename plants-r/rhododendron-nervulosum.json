It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage with intricate, finely veined leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces showy, clustered flowers that range in color from pink to red, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and requires partial to full shade for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
