    "intro": "Rhus fulvescens, commonly known as the staghorn sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern and central United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically arranged in pairs along the stems, and its clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in late spring. The plant produces red, fuzzy berries that are a food source for various birds and animals. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in woodland edges, thickets, and disturbed soils. Rhus fulvescens is also known for its ability to tolerate a wide range of soil conditions, making it a resilient and adaptable species."
