    "intro": "Restrepia dodsonii, commonly known as the Dodson's restrepia, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to the Andean regions of South America. It is a terrestrial orchid with a pseudobulbous structure, featuring a short, thick stem that stores water and nutrients. The plant produces striking, showy flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, often with intricate patterns on the petals and sepals. It thrives in cool, humid environments with well-drained soil, typically found in cloud forests at high elevations. Due to habitat destruction and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
