    "intro": "Rauvolfia spinosa, commonly known as Indian snakeroot, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Pacific. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters in height, characterized by its rough, woody stems and alternate leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers that are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its roots and leaves are used in traditional medicine for their hypotensive properties due to the presence of alkaloids like reserpine. Botanically, it belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants."
