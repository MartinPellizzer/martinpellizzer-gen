    "intro": "Rubus minutidentatus, commonly known as the small-toothed blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and thorny stems, typical of many Rubus species. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically harvested in the fall. Its leaves are trifoliate, with finely serrated margins, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The botanical features of Rubus minutidentatus make it an important component of its native ecosystems."
