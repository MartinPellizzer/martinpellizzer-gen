    "intro": "Ricinus communis f. zonatus, commonly known as the variegated castor bean, is a variant of the castor oil plant characterized by its distinctive leaf patterns. The leaves are typically green with yellow or white margins, creating a striking visual contrast. This form is a naturally occurring mutation within the species, resulting in the unique coloration. It is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage. However, like other members of the genus Ricinus, it contains toxic compounds and should be handled with care."
