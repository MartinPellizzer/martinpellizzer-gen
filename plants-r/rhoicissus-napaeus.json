It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that often have a silvery or white underside. The plant produces small, pale green flowers followed by orange to red berries that are edible for birds and some mammals. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often used in ornamental gardening. Its rapid growth and climbing habit make it a popular choice for trellises and green walls."
