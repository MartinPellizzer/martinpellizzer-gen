    "intro": "Racosperma inaequilaterum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved wattle, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family Fabaceae. It is native to Australia and is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and bipinnate leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces yellow flowers in cylindrical spikes, which are typical of the wattles. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Racosperma inaequilaterum is often used in revegetation projects due to its resilience and ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
