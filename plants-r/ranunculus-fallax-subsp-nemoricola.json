It typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, often in moist, shaded environments. The plant features delicate, palmately lobed leaves and bright yellow flowers with five petals. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and is often found in meadows and forest edges. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
