    "intro": "Ruellia pulverulenta, commonly known as the dusty ruellia, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or shaded areas. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are usually violet or blue in color, blooming from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, powdery coating, giving it its common name. Ruellia pulverulenta is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
