    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 scabrohirtus, commonly known as the rough-hairy blackberry, is a hybrid species within the Rubus genus. It is characterized by its thorny stems and aggregate fruits that typically range in color from red to black. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by the development of its edible berries. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland areas or along the edges of forests. The leaves are usually trifoliate, with serrated edges and a hairy texture that gives the plant its common name."
