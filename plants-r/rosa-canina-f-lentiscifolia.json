It features small, dark green leaves with a leathery texture, and its flowers are typically pale yellow with five petals. The plant produces red, fuzzy fruits called hips, which are rich in vitamin C. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in hedges or as a ornamental plant. This form is a natural variant of Rosa canina, distinguished by its dense growth habit and unique foliage."
