    "intro": "Rhododendron recurvum, commonly known as the zigzag rhododendron, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its dense, broad leaves that are often folded or curled, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of showy, pink to red flowers in late spring to early summer. Its flowers are typically funnel-shaped and have a distinctive, recurved (backward-curving) lip. Rhododendron recurvum thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens."
