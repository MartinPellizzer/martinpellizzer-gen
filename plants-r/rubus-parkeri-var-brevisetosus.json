    "intro": "Rubus parkeri var. brevisetosus, commonly known as the short-stiff bramble, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of white to pale pink flowers. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible but often described as tart. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it thrives in moist, woodland habitats. This variety is distinguished by its dense, short-stiff prickles, which give it its botanical name."
