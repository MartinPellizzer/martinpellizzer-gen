    "intro": "Rosa chloribulgarica, commonly known as the Bulgarian yellow rose, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Bulgaria. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow flowers, which bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant typically grows in rocky and well-drained soils, often in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its foliage consists of dark green, serrated leaves, and it produces fragrant, single or semi-double blooms. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
