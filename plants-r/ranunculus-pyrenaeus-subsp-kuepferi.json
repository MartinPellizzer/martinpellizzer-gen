    "intro": "Ranunculus pyrenaeus subsp. kuepferi, commonly known as the Pyrenean buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, preferring moist, well-drained soils. The plant features showy yellow flowers with 5 to 15 sepals that are often not petal-like, and it has a basal rosette of leaves. Its leaves are deeply lobed and covered in fine hairs, and it is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological niche and limited distribution."
