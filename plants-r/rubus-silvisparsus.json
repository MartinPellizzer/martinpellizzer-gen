It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or black in color, resembling raspberries. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woods and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
