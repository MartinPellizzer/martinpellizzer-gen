    "intro": "Restrepia roseola, commonly known as the roseola orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in clusters during the warmer months. The plant has a pseudobulb structure, which stores water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its high-altitude, often harsh environment. Its leaves are elongated and grass-like, contributing to its unique appearance. Restrepia roseola is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and adaptability to specific growing conditions."
