    "intro": "Rosa canina f. pubens, commonly known as the pubescent dog rose, is a botanical variant of the common dog rose. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which distinguish it from the typical form. The plant produces fragrant, pink to red flowers that bloom in spring. Its fruit, a bright orange hip, is edible and often used in culinary applications. This subspecies is well adapted to temperate climates and is often found in hedgerows and woodland edges."
