    "intro": "Ruschia inclaudens, commonly known as the Cape marigold, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features compact, branching stems covered in dense, fleshy leaves that are typically green or blue-green in color. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, which bloom in spring and summer. It thrives in well-draining soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is widely cultivated in arid and semi-arid regions."
