    "intro": "Ricinus europaeus, commonly known as the European castor oil plant, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves and spiny capsules that contain toxic seeds. The plant produces showy, red-orange flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a hardy perennial in temperate climates. Due to its toxic properties, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant rather than for its seeds."
