    "intro": "Rosa canina f. elongatoramulosa, commonly known as the elongated thorned dog rose, is a botanical variant of the common dog rose. It is characterized by its elongated, stiff thorns and slightly larger, more pointed leaves compared to the typical Rosa canina. The flowers are usually pale pink to white, with five petals and a fragrant scent. This form is less common in cultivation but can be found in certain wild populations across Europe. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and interesting subject for horticultural study."
