    "intro": "Ranunculus repens var. degeneratus, commonly known as the creeping buttercup, is a low-growing perennial plant characterized by its spreading habit and bright yellow flowers. It typically thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in wet meadows, stream banks, and other damp environments. The plant features trifoliate leaves with three rounded lobes and produces small, delicate flowers with five petals. It is an invasive species in many regions due to its rapid spread and ability to outcompete native vegetation. Its botanical significance lies in its ecological impact and role in wetland ecosystems."
