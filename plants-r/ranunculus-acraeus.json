    "intro": "Ranunculus acraeus, commonly known as the alpine buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It features a short, stout stem that bears a single, showy yellow flower with numerous petals arranged in a cup-like shape. The plant has palmately divided leaves that are hairy and covered in glandular dots, which secrete a sticky substance. It thrives in cool, moist environments at high altitudes, often growing in rocky or gravelly soils. Ranunculus acraeus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
