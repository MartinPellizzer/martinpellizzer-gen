    "intro": "Rottboellia lepidura, commonly known as the narrow-leafed grass or African grass, is a perennial herb native to Africa, Asia, and Australia. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Rottboellia lepidura is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread aggressively."
