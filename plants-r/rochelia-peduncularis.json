    "intro": "Rochelia peduncularis, commonly known as the slender sea lettuce, is a marine green alga found in intertidal zones. It has a filamentous structure with elongated, ribbon-like thalli that can reach up to 20 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in shallow, coastal waters where it attaches to rocks or other substrates. Its reproductive structures are located at the tips of its branches, facilitating both sexual and asexual reproduction. Rochelia peduncularis plays a vital role in coastal ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various marine organisms."
