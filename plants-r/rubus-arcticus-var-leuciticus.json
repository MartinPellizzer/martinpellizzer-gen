    "intro": "Rubus arcticus var. leuciticus, commonly known as the Arctic raspberry, is a low-growing shrub native to Arctic and subarctic regions. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant's leaves are typically trifoliate, with serrated edges adapted to cold climates. Its fruits, which are small and tart, are edible and used by both humans and wildlife. This variety is well-suited to harsh environments, thriving in nutrient-poor soils and enduring extreme temperature fluctuations."
