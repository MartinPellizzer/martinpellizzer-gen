It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and produces small, dark purple to black berries. The plant has compound leaves with three to five leaflets and thorny stems typical of the Rubus genus. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. The berries are edible but have a tart flavor and are sometimes used in local cuisines."
