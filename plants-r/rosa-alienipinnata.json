    "intro": "Rosa alienipinnata, commonly known as the alien-feathered rose, is a rare and exotic species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its unique, feathery foliage and striking, deep-pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has compound leaves with elongated, narrow leaflets that give it a delicate, almost otherworldly appearance. It thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Rosa alienipinnata is considered a botanically significant and endangered species."
