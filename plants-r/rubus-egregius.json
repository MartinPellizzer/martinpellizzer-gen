    "intro": "Rubus egregius, commonly known as the alpine everlet, is a species of bramble native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit, with thorny stems and compound leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in early spring, followed by red, edible berries that are highly sought after by wildlife. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forested areas at high altitudes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Rubus egregius is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant."
