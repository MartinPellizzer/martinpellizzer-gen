    "intro": "Rosa gallica f. rubiformis, commonly known as the crimson gallica rose, is a compact shrub native to Europe. It features upright stems covered in dense, thorny prickles and produces fragrant, semi-double blooms in shades of red and pink. The leaves are dark green, glossy, and arranged in odd-pinnate clusters. This variety is prized for its ornamental value in gardens and its historical use in perfumery. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, requiring minimal maintenance once established."
