    "intro": "Rosa occulta, commonly known as the hidden rose, is a rare and elusive species of flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its delicate pink to white flowers and thorny stems, typical of many rose species. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Its foliage consists of pinnately compound leaves with serrated edges. Due to its limited distribution and protected status, Rosa occulta is considered a rare and endangered species."
