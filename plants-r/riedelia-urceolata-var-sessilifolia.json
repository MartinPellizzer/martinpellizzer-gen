    "intro": "Riedelia urceolata var. sessilifolia, commonly known as the sessile-leaf riedelia, is a flowering plant native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The leaves are sessile, meaning they are attached directly to the stem without a stalk, giving the plant a unique appearance. It thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable growing conditions."
