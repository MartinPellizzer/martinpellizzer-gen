    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus subsp. latisinuatus, commonly known as the broad-lobed buttercup, is a member of the Ranunculaceae family. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers with five to nine petals and deeply lobed leaves. Native to the western United States, this subspecies thrives in moist, well-drained soils in meadows and along streambanks. The plant typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm, with a short, hairy stem. Its leaves are palmately divided and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its native habitat."
