It is characterized by its tall, erect fronds that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant has a distinctive appearance with its finely divided, serrated leaves and a dense network of roots. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth. The fern's unique morphology and ecological role make it an important component of New Zealand's native flora."
