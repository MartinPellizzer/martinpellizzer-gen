    "intro": "Rubus corylifolius subsp. cyclophyllus, commonly known as the Chinese blackberry, is a shrub native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its dark purple to black berries, which are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. The plant has compound leaves with serrated edges and thorny stems, typical of many Rubus species. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forested areas or along streambanks. Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and sometimes invasive in non-native regions."
