    "intro": "Rubus perconspicuus, commonly known as the showy blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its dark purple to black berries, which are typically larger and more flavorful than those of other Rubus species. The plant has thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges, typical of the Rubus genus. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and full sun exposure. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and small-scale farms."
