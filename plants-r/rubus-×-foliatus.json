    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 foliatus, commonly known as the hybrid blackberry raspberry, is a deciduous shrub belonging to the Rosaceae family. It is a natural hybrid between Rubus ursinus (blackberry) and Rubus idaeus (raspberry), resulting in a plant that exhibits characteristics of both parents. The plant produces aggregate fruits that are typically red or black in color, with a tart flavor and a firm texture. Its leaves are compound, with three to five leaflets, and are covered in fine, silvery hairs. Rubus \u00d7 foliatus is often found in temperate regions and is cultivated for its edible fruits and ornamental value."
