    "intro": "Rosa \u00d7 oblonga var. obsoletedenticulata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hybrid rose, is a botanical variety characterized by its elongated, narrow leaves and compact growth habit. It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Rosa \u00d7 gallica and Rosa \u00d7 canina, showcasing a blend of traits from both parent species. The plant typically produces fragrant, semi-double to double pink or white flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its foliage is usually dark green and slightly serrated, with a distinctive, narrow leaf shape that sets it apart from other rose varieties. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic and aromatic qualities."
