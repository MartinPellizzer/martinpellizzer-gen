    "intro": "Rosa canina f. subvirens, commonly known as the greenleaf dogrose, is a botanical variant of the common dogrose. It is characterized by its distinctive greenish-yellow flowers and smaller, more compact foliage compared to the typical Rosa canina. The plant is native to parts of Europe and is often found in woodland edges and open habitats. It produces small, red-orange hips that are edible and used in traditional medicine. This form is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
