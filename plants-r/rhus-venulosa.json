The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in upright clusters, followed by red, fuzzy fruits that are a common source of berries for birds. Its bark is smooth and grayish, and it thrives in a variety of soil types, including dry, rocky areas. Rhus venulosa is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to attract wildlife."
