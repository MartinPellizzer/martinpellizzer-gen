    "intro": "Rubus hirtus var. bakabanyensis, commonly known as the Bakabanye raspberry, is a shrub native to the high-altitude regions of eastern Africa. It is characterized by its erect or semi-erect growth habit and produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or yellow in color. The leaves are usually hairy, with a serrated margin, and the plant thrives in cool, moist environments. It is often found in forest understories and along stream banks, where it contributes to local biodiversity. The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
