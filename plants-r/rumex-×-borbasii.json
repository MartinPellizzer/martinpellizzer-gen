    "intro": "Rumex \u00d7 borbasii, commonly known as the hybrid sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant that belongs to the Polygonaceae family. It is a natural hybrid between Rumex acetosa (common sorrel) and Rumex acetobatus (water sorrel), resulting in a plant with distinctive botanical features. The leaves are typically heart-shaped, with a serrated margin and a reddish or purple coloration on the veins, which is a characteristic of the genus Rumex. It produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, and its roots are rhizomatous, allowing it to spread vegetatively. This plant is often found in wet or moist soils, such as marshes and streambanks, where it thrives in humid conditions."
