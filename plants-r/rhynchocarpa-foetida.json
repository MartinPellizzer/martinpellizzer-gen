    "intro": "Rhynchocarpa foetida, commonly known as the stinking fruit tree, is a small shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by distinctive, fleshy, orange-red fruits. The fruits are known for their strong, unpleasant odor, which is a defense mechanism against herbivores. It thrives in moist, tropical environments and is often found in lowland forests."
