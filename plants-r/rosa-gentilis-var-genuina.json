    "intro": "Rosa gentilis var. genuina, commonly known as the Alpine rose or the alpine garden rose, is a compact shrub native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features dense, dark green foliage and produces fragrant, semi-double pink flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant is well adapted to cold climates and can thrive in rocky or well-drained soils. It is often used in rock gardens or as a border plant due to its hardiness and ornamental value. Its botanical characteristics make it a popular choice for gardeners seeking a resilient and visually appealing plant."
