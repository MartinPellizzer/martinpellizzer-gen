It features finely divided, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette. The plant produces showy yellow flowers with five petals, often adorned with a distinctive white or pale green central marking. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and stream banks. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in some regions."
