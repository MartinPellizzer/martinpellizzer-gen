    "intro": "Rubus juennensis, commonly known as the Juanense blackberry, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is native to the Andean regions of South America, specifically in Ecuador and Peru. The plant is characterized by its thorny stems, compound leaves, and aggregate fruits that develop from multiple small drupes. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and full sun exposure. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
