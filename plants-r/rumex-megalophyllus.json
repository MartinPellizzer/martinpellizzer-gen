It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in length, often with a reddish or purple underside. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish flowers that are arranged in a dense, terminal spike. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The leaves and roots of Rumex megalophyllus have been used traditionally in some indigenous communities for medicinal purposes."
