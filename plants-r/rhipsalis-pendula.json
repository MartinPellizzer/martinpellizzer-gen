    "intro": "Rhipsalis pendula, commonly known as the weeping Christmas cactus, is a species of cactus native to Brazil. It is characterized by its long, trailing stems that produce clusters of small, white flowers resembling those of a Christmas cactus. The plant has no true leaves, instead featuring small, hair-like structures called trichomes that help reduce water loss. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Rhipsalis pendula is often cultivated as a hanging plant due to its graceful, cascading growth habit."
