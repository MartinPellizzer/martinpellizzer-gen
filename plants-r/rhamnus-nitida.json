    "intro": "Rhamnus nitida, commonly known as glossy buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and small, dark green, glossy leaves that are opposite in arrangement. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring, followed by black, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds. Rhamnus nitida thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for coastal and dry garden environments. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and seasonal interest."
