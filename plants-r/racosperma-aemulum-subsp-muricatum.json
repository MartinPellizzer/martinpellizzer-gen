    "intro": "Racosperma aemulum subsp. muricatum, commonly known as the rough-flowered acacia, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its dense, glandular, and often hairy foliage, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in cylindrical spikes, which are typical of the Acacia genus. Its small, leathery seed pods contain seeds that are adapted for dispersal by animals and wind. This subspecies is well-suited to dry conditions and is often used in rehabilitation of degraded soils."
