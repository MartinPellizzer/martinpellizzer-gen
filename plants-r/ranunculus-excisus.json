    "intro": "Ranunculus excisus, commonly known as the cutleaf buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It features striking, showy flowers with five to eight petals, typically in shades of yellow or orange, surrounded by a ring of green sepals. The plant has finely divided, pinnately lobed leaves that give it a delicate, fern-like appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, streambanks, and woodland edges. Ranunculus excisus is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to cultivate in temperate climates."
