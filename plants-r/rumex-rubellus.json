    "intro": "Rumex rubellus, commonly known as red sorrel, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its reddish stems and heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive sour taste due to its high oxalic acid content. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Rumex rubellus is also known for its medicinal properties and has been used historically in traditional remedies."
