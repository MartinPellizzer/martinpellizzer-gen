It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are alternate and pinnately arranged, with serrated margins. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by red, fuzzy berries that persist into winter. Its bark is thick and rough, often appearing flaky or scaly, and it thrives in full sun to partial shade. This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
