    "intro": "Restrepiella ophiocephala f. clausa, commonly known as the closed-flowered restrepiella, is a rare and unique plant species belonging to the family Cucurbitaceae. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive, closed flowers that remain tightly sealed even after pollination. The plant exhibits a preference for shaded, humid environments, typically found in the understory of tropical rainforests. Its leaves are heart-shaped with a slightly pubescent surface, and the fruits are small, round, and typically green when mature. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered an endangered species in its native range."
