    "intro": "Rosa glauca var. armifera, commonly known as the armed blue rose, is a variant of the blue rose species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. This plant is characterized by its striking deep blue petals, which are a result of high concentrations of anthocyanin pigments. The leaves are typically narrow and serrated, with a bluish-green hue, and the stems are often covered in fine, bristly hairs. It produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique color and hardy nature."
