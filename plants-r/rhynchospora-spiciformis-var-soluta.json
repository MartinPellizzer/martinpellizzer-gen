    "intro": "Rhynchospora spiciformis var. soluta, commonly known as the spiked flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments in the southeastern United States. It features grass-like leaves that are typically narrow and flat, with a bluish-green coloration. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, greenish-white flowers, which are clustered closely together. It thrives in saturated soils and is often found in association with other wetland flora. This variant is distinguished by its compact growth habit and specific morphological features that set it apart from other rhynchospora species."
