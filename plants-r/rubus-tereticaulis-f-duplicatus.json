    "intro": "Rubus tereticaulis f. duplicatus, commonly known as the twin-fruited blackberry, is a subspecies of the blackberry plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its biennial growth habit, with flowering occurring on the previous year's growth. The plant produces two types of fruits on the same inflorescence, a unique trait that distinguishes it from other Rubus species. Its leaves are typically trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the stems are covered in dense, prickly hairs. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental value and its potential for cultivation in native plant gardens."
