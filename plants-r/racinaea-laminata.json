    "intro": "Racinaea laminata, commonly known as the lace fern, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that resemble lace. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with long, creeping stems that produce aerial roots. Its leaves are typically pinnately divided, with small, pointed lobes that give it a finely textured appearance. Racinaea laminata thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often used in ornamental horticulture for its aesthetic appeal."
