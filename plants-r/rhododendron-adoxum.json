    "intro": "Rhododendron adoxum, commonly known as the dwarf rhododendron, is a compact shrub native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of pink to purple. The plant typically grows to a height of less than two meters, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. It prefers well-drained, acidic soil and partial shade, thriving in cool, humid climates. Rhododendron adoxum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to add color to shaded garden spaces."
