    "intro": "Roella divina, commonly known as the sacred lotus, is a striking aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features large, showy flowers that bloom in a sequence, starting with a deep purple bud that gradually opens into a white or pink blossom. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, supported by long, fibrous stems. Its roots are anchored in the muddy substrate at the bottom of still or slow-moving water bodies. Roella divina is not only ornamental but also holds cultural and spiritual significance in many Asian traditions."
