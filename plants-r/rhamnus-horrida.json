    "intro": "Rhamnus horrida, commonly known as the rough buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving them a rough texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by black, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds and some mammals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or dry habitats. Rhamnus horrida is characterized by its thorny stems and its ability to withstand drought conditions."
