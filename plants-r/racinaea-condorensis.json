    "intro": "Racinaea condorensis, commonly known as the Andean ghost orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent leaves and intricate, fragrant flowers that resemble those of the orchid family. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree branches or rocks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered. Conservation efforts are crucial to protect this unique botanical species from further decline."
