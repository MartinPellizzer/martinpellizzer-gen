    "intro": "Royena macrophylla, commonly known as the broad-leaved royal fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, lance-shaped leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that produce new fronds along their length. Its fronds are typically bipinnate, with a delicate, feathery appearance that adds ornamental value to gardens. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid tropical forests."
