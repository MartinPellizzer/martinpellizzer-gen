It is characterized by its delicate, yellow flowers with five petals and a hairy stem. The leaves are trifoliate, meaning they are divided into three parts, and are typically lobed or deeply toothed. This variety thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often found in botanical gardens and wildflower meadows."
