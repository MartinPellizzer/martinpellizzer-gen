    "intro": "Rhododendron praestans, commonly known as the Alpine rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows in high-altitude habitats, such as alpine meadows and rocky slopes. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or red, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, providing a striking contrast to the vibrant floral display. Rhododendron praestans is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in cool, moist environments."
