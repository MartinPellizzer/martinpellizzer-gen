    "intro": "Rottboellia villosa, commonly known as hairy panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its hairy leaves and panicle-like inflorescence, which consists of numerous small spikelets. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields, thriving in full sun. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread readily, making it a common weed in agricultural settings. Rottboellia villosa is often used in ecological studies due to its adaptability and role in soil stabilization."
