    "intro": "Rhodiola rosea subsp. arctica, commonly known as the Arctic rhodiola, is a hardy perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with fleshy, dark green leaves and small, pink or red flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in cold, nutrient-poor soils and is adapted to survive in harsh, high-altitude environments. Its roots contain various bioactive compounds, including rosavins and salidrosides, which are believed to have adaptogenic properties. This subspecies is often used in traditional medicine for its purported ability to enhance physical endurance and reduce stress."
