    "intro": "Rosa \u00d7 dumetorum subvar. perciliata, commonly known as the alpine rose or alpine dog\u73ab\u7470, is a perennial shrub native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with densely packed, thornless stems that form a low, cushion-like plant. The leaves are alternate, simple, and covered in fine, silvery-white hairs, giving them a frosty appearance. Its flowers are typically pale pink to white, with five petals and numerous stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer. This plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments."
