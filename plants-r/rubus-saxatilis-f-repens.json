    "intro": "Rubus saxatilis f. repens, commonly known as the creeping raspberry, is a low-growing shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across rocky or disturbed ground. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or yellow, often with a hairy texture. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges and a slightly hairy surface. This variety is well adapted to harsh environments, thriving in full sun and poor soil conditions."
