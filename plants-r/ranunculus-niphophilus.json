    "intro": "Ranunculus niphophilus, commonly known as the snow-loving buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It thrives in cold, moist environments and is often found in mountainous areas with well-drained soil. The plant features showy yellow flowers with a distinct cup-shaped structure, and its leaves are deeply lobed and covered in fine hairs. It is adapted to withstand harsh winter conditions, often remaining green throughout the winter months. Ranunculus niphophilus plays an important ecological role in alpine ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing soil in rocky habitats."
