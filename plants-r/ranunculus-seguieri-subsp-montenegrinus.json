    "intro": "Ranunculus seguieri subsp. montenegrinus, commonly known as the Montenegro buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It features delicate, palmately lobed leaves and showy, yellow flowers with a distinctive, hairy center. The plant typically grows in moist, shady woodland habitats, preferring well-drained soils. It is characterized by its short stature and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
