It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and clusters of fragrant, pink to white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, exhibiting a hardy and resilient nature. Its leaves are covered in a fine, white tomentum, which helps to protect it from harsh environmental conditions. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and full sun."
