It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black in color. It thrives in moist, wooded areas and is often found in the understory of forests. Due to its hardy nature, it is a common sight in wetlands and along stream banks."
