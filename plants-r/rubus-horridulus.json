    "intro": "Rubus horridulus, commonly known as the bristly blackberry, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is native to North America and is characterized by its thorny stems and dark, edible berries. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and thickets. Its leaves are compound, with serrated edges, and its flowers are white or pale pink. The fruit, which ripens in late summer, is often used in jams and pies despite its slightly bitter taste."
