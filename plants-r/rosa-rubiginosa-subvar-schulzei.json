    "intro": "Rosa rubiginosa subvar. schulzei, commonly known as the Schulze's shrub rose, is a shrub-like species native to the Mediterranean region. It features thorny stems and dark green, leathery leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the branches. The plant produces clusters of small, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fruits are dry, hairy achenes that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread across rocky and arid environments. This variety is adapted to dry, sunny conditions and is often found in coastal and limestone soils."
