    "intro": "Randia elliptica, commonly known as the narrowleaf randia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows up to 3 meters in height, featuring opposite, elliptic leaves with smooth or slightly hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Randia elliptica is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its botanical features make it a valuable species for ecological studies and potential medicinal applications."
