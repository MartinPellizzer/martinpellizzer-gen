    "intro": "Rubus mediocris, commonly known as the common blackberry shrub, is a species of brambles native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its thorny stems, trifoliate leaves, and aggregate fruits that develop from multiple ovaria. The plant produces dark purple to black berries that are often used in culinary and medicinal applications. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a common sight in hedgerows and woodland edges. Rubus mediocris is also noted for its ability to spread through vegetative propagation, forming dense thickets."
