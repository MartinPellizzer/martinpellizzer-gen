    "intro": "Rosa canina subsp. hispidissima, commonly known as the hairy rose or bristly dog rose, is a subspecies of the dog rose native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and small, pink to white flowers that bloom in spring. The leaves are pinnately compound, with five to seven leaflets that are covered in fine hairs. The fruit, a red, hairy rose hip, is a key feature and is used in traditional medicine. This subspecies is often found in hedgerows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils."
