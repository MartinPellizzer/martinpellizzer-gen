    "intro": "Rhododendron augustinei var. yui, commonly known as the Yui rhododendron, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan, China. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and showy clusters of pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in cool, humid climates with well-drained acidic soil, making it a challenging but rewarding species for horticulturists. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, providing a striking contrast to its vibrant floral displays. Due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity, it is considered a conservation priority in its native habitat."
