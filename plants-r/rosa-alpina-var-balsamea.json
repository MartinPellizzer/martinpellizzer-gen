It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in cool, moist climates. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white, often with a balsamic scent. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and covered in a fine, fuzzy layer that helps retain moisture. This variety is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
