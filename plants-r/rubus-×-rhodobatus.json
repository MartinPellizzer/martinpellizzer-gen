    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 rhodobatus, commonly known as the red-berried blackberry, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Rubus ursinus (the American blackberry) and Rubus idaeus (the common raspberry). It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red when mature, though they may also appear black depending on the variety. It thrives in temperate climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. This species is valued for its edible berries, which are often used in jams, pies, and other culinary applications."
