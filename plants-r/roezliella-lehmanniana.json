    "intro": "Roezliella lehmanniana, commonly known as the Lehmann's roezliella, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it grows in rocky and sandy soils. The plant features delicate, fern-like leaves and produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels. It is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and along rocky outcrops. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species."
