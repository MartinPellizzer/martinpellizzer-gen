    "intro": "Rhododendron vaseyi f. album, commonly known as the white-flowered rhododendron, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its broad, leathery leaves and showy, white to pale pink flowers. The plant thrives in cool, moist, acidic soils and is often found in cloud forests at high elevations. Its ornamental value lies in its elegant blooms, which appear in spring and are highly sought after by horticulturists. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
