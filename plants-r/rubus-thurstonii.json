    "intro": "Rubus thurstonii, commonly known as Thurston's blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its woody stems, trifoliate leaves, and aggregate fruits that develop from multiple ovaria. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, and the berries are dark purple to black when mature. This species is often found in association with other Rubus species and plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for wildlife."
