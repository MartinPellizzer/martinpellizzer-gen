    "intro": "Royena sericea, commonly known as the silky rosenia, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, silver-green foliage and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are covered in fine, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss. The flowers are pollinated by insects, and the plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds."
