    "intro": "Rhodognaphalopsis flaviflora var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth-flowered yellow gentian, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and produces striking yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has smooth, glabrous leaves and stems, which distinguish it from other varieties in the genus. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
