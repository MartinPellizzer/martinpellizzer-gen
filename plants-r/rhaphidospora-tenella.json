It is characterized by its finely divided, linear fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces spores in small, clustered sporangia located on the underside of its leaves. Rhaphidospora tenella thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its unique spore structure and growth habits make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
