    "intro": "Rosa lagenoides, commonly known as the globular rose, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is native to the western United States, particularly California, and thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and its clusters of small, fragrant flowers that bloom in spring. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with oval, serrated leaflets, and its fruit is a distinctive, rounded aggregate of achenes. Rosa lagenoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance and resilience."
