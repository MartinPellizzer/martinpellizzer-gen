    "intro": "Rosa canina var. heckeliana, commonly known as the Heckeliana rose, is a variant of the dog rose, characterized by its compact growth habit and repeat-flowering capability. It produces small, fragrant pink flowers that bloom throughout the growing season, adding ornamental value to gardens. The plant is deciduous, shedding its leaves in autumn, and is adapted to temperate climates. Its hips, like those of Rosa canina, are edible and can be used in jams and teas. This variety is valued for its hardiness and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
