    "intro": "Rumex \u00d7 hayekii, commonly known as the hybrid sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Polygonaceae family. It is a natural hybrid between Rumex acetosa (common sorrel) and Rumex acetobulus (broad-leafed sorrel), resulting in a plant with distinctive morphological features. The leaves are typically heart-shaped with a reddish coloration on the veins, and the plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in spikes. It is often found in moist, calcareous soils in temperate regions. Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits variability in growth habits and leaf characteristics compared to its parent species."
