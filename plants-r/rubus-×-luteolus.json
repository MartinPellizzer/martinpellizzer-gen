    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 luteolus, commonly known as the yellow bramble, is a hybrid species within the Rubus genus, characterized by its distinctive yellowish flowers and prickly stems. It is native to parts of Europe and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils. The plant produces aggregate fruits, known as drupes, which are typically red or yellow in color. Its leaves are palmately compound, with three to five leaflets, and are often covered in fine hairs. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens despite its invasive tendencies in natural habitats."
