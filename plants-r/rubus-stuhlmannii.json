It belongs to the Rubus genus, which includes many species of shrubs commonly referred to as blackberries or raspberries. The plant is characterized by its thorny stems, trifoliate leaves, and aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black in color. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forest understories or along streambanks. The berries are edible and have a flavor similar to other Rubus species, though they are less commonly cultivated."
