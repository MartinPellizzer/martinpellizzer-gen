    "intro": "Rhododendron pubigermen var. banghamiorum, commonly known as the Bangham's alpine rhododendron, is a rare and specialized plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and clusters of bell-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained, acidic soils, often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its narrow leaves and compact growth habit make it well adapted to harsh mountain conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
