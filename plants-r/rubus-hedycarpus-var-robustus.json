    "intro": "Rubus hedycarpus var. robustus, commonly known as the giant blackberry or robust blackberry, is a vigorous shrub native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated margins. The plant produces dark purple to black berries that are typically larger and more robust than those of other Rubus species. These berries are often used in local cuisines and traditional medicine due to their high antioxidant content. Its botanical features make it a notable species within the Rubus genus, particularly for its ecological and horticultural significance."
