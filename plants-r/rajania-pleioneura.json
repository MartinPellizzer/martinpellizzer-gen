    "intro": "Rajania pleioneura, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking yellow flowers that bloom during the rainy season. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth, where it thrives in partial shade. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to anchor firmly in the soil while absorbing nutrients efficiently. The leaves are long, narrow, and often have a waxy texture, which helps reduce water loss in its humid habitat."
