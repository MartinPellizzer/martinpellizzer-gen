    "intro": "Rhododendron macrocarpum, commonly known as the large-fruited rhododendron, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It features broad, ovate leaves that are often densely covered with fine hairs, giving them a velvety texture. The plant produces showy, clustered flowers in shades of pink to red, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its flowers are followed by large, leathery fruits that contain numerous seeds. Rhododendron macrocarpum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
