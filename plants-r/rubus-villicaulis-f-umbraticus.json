    "intro": "Rubus villicaulis f. umbraticus, commonly known as the shaded raspberry. This variant of the raspberry plant is characterized by its darker foliage and reduced flowering compared to the typical form. It thrives in shaded environments, making it well-suited for woodland or semi-shaded gardens. The plant produces small, tart berries similar to other Rubus species. Botanically, it is distinguished by its morphology and growth habits adapted to lower light conditions."
