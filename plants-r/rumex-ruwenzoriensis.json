    "intro": "Rumex ruwenzoriensis, commonly known as the Ruwenzori sorrel, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of East Africa, particularly the Rwenzori Mountains. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and distinctive, palmately lobed leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers during the rainy season, which are followed by elongated, ribbed fruits. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the high-altitude conditions of its native habitat. Due to its unique morphology and restricted distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
