    "intro": "Rosa volhyniensis, commonly known as the Volhynian rose, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is native to Eastern Europe, particularly Ukraine and parts of Russia, and thrives in temperate climates. The plant is characterized by its thorny stems, pinnately compound leaves, and fragrant, pink to red flowers that bloom in summer. Rosa volhyniensis is often found in forest edges, meadows, and rocky areas, where it forms dense thickets. Its ornamental value has made it a popular choice for gardens, though it requires well-drained soil and full sun to flourish."
