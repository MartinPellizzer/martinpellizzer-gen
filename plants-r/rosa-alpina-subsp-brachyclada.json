    "intro": "Rosa alpina subsp. brachyclada, commonly known as the alpine rose, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in white or pink hues. The subspecies is distinguished by its shorter, more upright stems compared to the typical Rosa alpina. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three leaflets that are usually hairy and serrated. This plant thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes."
