    "intro": "Rhagadiolus lyratus, commonly known as the lyreleaf daisy, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its showy, daisy-like flowers that bloom in shades of yellow and white. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern at the base. Rhagadiolus lyratus thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its prolonged blooming period, which can last several months during the warmer seasons."
