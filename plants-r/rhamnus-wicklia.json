    "intro": "Rhamnus wicklia, commonly known as the white-fruited buckthorn, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, thorny branches and small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, followed by elongated, narrow fruits that turn from green to yellow or red as they mature. Its fruits are often consumed by birds, aiding in seed dispersal. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it resilient to drought conditions."
