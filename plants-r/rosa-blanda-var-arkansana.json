    "intro": "Rosa blanda var. arkansana, commonly known as the Arkansas bank\u73ab\u7470, is a low-growing shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features fragrant, semi-double pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, arching stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats along streambanks and moist woodlands. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three oval-shaped leaflets that are finely toothed. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in wet, shady conditions."
