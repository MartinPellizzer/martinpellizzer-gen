    "intro": "Rosa parvula, commonly known as the dwarf shrub rose, is a compact, deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It features small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has woody stems covered in fine, pale green or grayish hairs, and its leaves are composed of five to seven oval, serrated leaflets. Rosa parvula prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate appearance and long-lasting blooms."
