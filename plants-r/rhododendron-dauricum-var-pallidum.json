It features lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white to grayish hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pale pink to white in color, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas with cool, moist conditions.
