    "intro": "Ranunculus tembensis, commonly known as the mountain buttercup, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its bright yellow petals and delicate, compound leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as mountain forests and stream sides. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting various pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
