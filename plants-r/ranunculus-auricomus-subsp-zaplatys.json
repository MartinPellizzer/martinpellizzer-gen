It features showy, yellow flowers with five to nine petals, typically arranged in a cup-like shape, and is characterized by its finely divided, trifoliate leaves. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and stream banks. It produces small, green, spherical fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in some environments."
