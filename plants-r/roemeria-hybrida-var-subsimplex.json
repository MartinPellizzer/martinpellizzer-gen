    "intro": "Roemeria hybrida var. subsimplex, commonly known as the narrow-leaved roemeria, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It features slender, upright stems that bear lance-shaped leaves with a smooth, slightly hairy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white to pale pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is often cultivated in gardens and naturalized areas."
