    "intro": "Rosa canina f. psilophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved dogrose, is a botanical variant of the common dogrose, characterized by its slender, elongated leaves. This form exhibits reduced leaf size and a more compact growth habit compared to the typical Rosa canina. It is native to southern Europe and thrives in sunny, well-drained soils. The flowers are usually pink or white, with five petals, and produce rose hips that are smaller than those of the standard species. This form is often found in hedgerows and woodland edges, contributing to local biodiversity."
