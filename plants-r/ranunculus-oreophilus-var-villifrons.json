    "intro": "Ranunculus oreophilus var. villifrons, commonly known as the alpine buttercup, is a flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its delicate, yellow flowers with a distinctive central pistil and showy, petal-like sepals. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a hairy surface that helps reduce water loss in harsh conditions. This variety is noted for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
