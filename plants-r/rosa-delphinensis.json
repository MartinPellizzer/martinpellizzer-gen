    "intro": "Rosa delphinensis, commonly known as the Delphinian rose, is a species native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and parts of Turkey. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, characterized by its upright, thorny stems and dense foliage. The plant produces showy, semi-double flowers in shades of pink to red, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are compound, consisting of five to seven oval-shaped leaflets, and are covered in a fine layer of soft hairs. Rosa delphinensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its beauty and fragrance."
