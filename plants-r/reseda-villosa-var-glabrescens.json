It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, white or yellow flowers and pinnately divided leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and coastal areas. It produces small, round pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. The variety glabrescens is distinguished by its reduced pubescence compared to the typical form of Reseda villosa."
