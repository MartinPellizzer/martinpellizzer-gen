    "intro": "Rhinanthus spicatus, commonly known as the yellow rattle, is a flowering plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially depends on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. It is often found in grasslands and meadows, where it helps to reduce the dominance of grasses by parasitizing them. Rhinanthus spicatus plays an important role in promoting biodiversity by creating more favorable conditions for other wildflowers."
