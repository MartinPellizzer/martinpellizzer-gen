It features upright, branched stems that are often reddish in color, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters. The leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and have a distinctive sour taste due to the presence of oxalic acid. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. This plant is also known for its medicinal uses in traditional herbal remedies."
