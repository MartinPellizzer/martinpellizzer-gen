    "intro": "Rubus obtusangulus var. beirensis, commonly known as the Beirnes' blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to specific regions of China. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with ovate to elliptical leaflets. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black in color when mature. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
