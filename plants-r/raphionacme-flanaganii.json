    "intro": "Raphionacme flanaganii, commonly known as the Flanagan's raphionacme, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Acanthaceae family and typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or swampy areas. The plant features slender, upright stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It produces small, clustered flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
