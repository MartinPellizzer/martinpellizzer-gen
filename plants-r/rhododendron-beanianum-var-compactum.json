    "intro": "Rhododendron beanianum var. compactum, commonly known as the dwarf rhododendron, is a compact evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of China. It features dense, leathery foliage with deep green leaves that provide a striking backdrop for its showy, bell-shaped flowers. The blooms, which range in color from pink to white, are typically borne in clusters and appear in late spring to early summer. This variety is prized for its hardiness and ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments. Its compact growth habit makes it an excellent choice for rock gardens or as a specimen plant in smaller landscapes."
