    "intro": "Rugoloa hylaeica, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a species of flowering plant in the family Anacardiaceae. It is native to the Atlantic Forest region of eastern Brazil, where it thrives in humid, tropical climates. The plant is characterized by its dark, aromatic wood, which has been historically valued for its use in musical instruments and furniture. Rugoloa hylaeica produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by red, fleshy fruits. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now classified as endangered, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival."
