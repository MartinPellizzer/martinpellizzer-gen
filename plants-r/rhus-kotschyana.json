    "intro": "Rhus kotschyana, commonly known as the Kotschy's sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Middle East and parts of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically arranged in pairs along the stems, and its clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in early summer. The plant produces red, fuzzy fruits that contain one or two seeds, which are dispersed by animals. Rhus kotschyana is often found in arid or semi-arid environments, growing in rocky soils and along dry streambeds. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been introduced to various regions outside its native range."
