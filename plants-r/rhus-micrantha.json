    "intro": "Rhus micrantha, commonly known as the smooth sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically pinnately arranged and turn bright red in the fall. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in upright clusters, followed by red, fuzzy fruits that contain seeds. Rhus micrantha thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in moist to mesic soils. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to provide habitat for wildlife."
