    "intro": "Rhododendron lacteum, commonly known as the milk rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a distinctive yellow or greenish tinge. The plant typically grows in acidic, well-drained soils and thrives in shaded to partially shaded environments. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, providing a striking contrast to its floral display. Rhododendron lacteum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and botanical gardens."
