It features heart-shaped, dark green leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by reddish-brown seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and wet meadows. Its compact size and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for garden use in damp areas."
