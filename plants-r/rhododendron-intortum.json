It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. Its leaves are leathery and have a distinctive twisted or curled appearance, giving it its common name. Rhododendron intortum is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in horticulture for its unique foliage and floral display."
