    "intro": "Rubus tomentosus f. lloydianus, commonly known as the Lloyd's bramble, is a variant of the brambles native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its densely hairy stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, coarse texture. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, edible berries in the summer. It thrives in moist, woodland habitats and is often found in shaded, rocky areas. Its botanical features make it a notable species within the Rubus genus, valued for both its ecological role and ornamental appeal."
