    "intro": "Rhamnella crenulata, commonly known as the smoothleaf buckthorn, is a small shrub native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, wooded areas and has simple, alternate leaves that are often slightly wavy or toothed. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, followed by small, fleshy berries that are an important food source for birds. It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae, which includes other shrubs and trees with similar characteristics. The plant is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in disturbed soils."
