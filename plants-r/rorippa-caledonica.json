    "intro": "Rorippa caledonica, commonly known as the Scottish water-crowfoot, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic flowering plant native to the UK and parts of northern Europe. It typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds, ditches, and the margins of lakes. The plant has basal leaves that are deeply lobed and submerged leaves that are thread-like, adapted for underwater life. Its flowers are small, white or pale yellow, and arranged in clusters at the water's surface. Rorippa caledonica plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and amphibians."
