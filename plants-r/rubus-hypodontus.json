    "intro": "Rubus hypodontus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved blackberry, is a species of bramble native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically edible. It thrives in woodland edges, hedgerows, and other disturbed soils, preferring moist, well-drained conditions. Its botanical features make it a common sight in temperate regions, though it is often overlooked due to its modest appearance."
