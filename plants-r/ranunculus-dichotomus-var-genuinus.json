It features finely divided, fern-like leaves and produces showy yellow flowers with 5 to 15 petals. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its flowers bloom in early spring, and it is often found in the Pacific Northwest. The species is characterized by its dichotomous branching pattern, which gives it its scientific name."
