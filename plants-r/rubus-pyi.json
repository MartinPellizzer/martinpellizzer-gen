    "intro": "Rubus pyi, commonly known as the dwarf blackberry. It is a species of brambles native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia, particularly in countries like Thailand, Vietnam, and Malaysia. The plant is characterized by its small, thorny stems and clusters of small, dark red to black berries. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The berries are often used in local cuisines and traditional medicine, though the plant is less cultivated compared to other Rubus species."
