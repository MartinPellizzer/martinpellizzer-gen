    "intro": "Rosa alpicola, commonly known as the alpine rose, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is a shrub that typically grows in rocky and alpine environments, thriving at high altitudes where conditions are harsh. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps to reduce water loss in cold, dry climates. Rosa alpicola is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
