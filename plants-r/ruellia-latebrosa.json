    "intro": "Ruellia latebrosa, commonly known as the silverleaf ruellia, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in partial to full shade. It is often found in woodland areas and along streambanks, where it contributes to the biodiversity of the ecosystem. Ruellia latebrosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
