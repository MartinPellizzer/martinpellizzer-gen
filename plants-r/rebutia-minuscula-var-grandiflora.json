    "intro": "Rebutia minuscula var. grandiflora, commonly known as the small-flowered cushion cactus, is a compact, low-growing cactus native to southern Africa. It features dense, rounded pads covered in pale green to blue-gray spines, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring or early summer. Its foliage is succulent, adapted for storing water, and it thrives in full sun with well-draining soil. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and ease of cultivation in rock gardens or containers."
