    "intro": "Rapicactus mandragora, commonly known as the ghost cactus, is a species of cactus native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are modified into spines, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant is well adapted to coastal environments and can tolerate salt spray and strong winds."
