    "intro": "Ranunculus fallax subsp. abditus, commonly known as the hidden buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves that are often covered in fine white or yellowish pubescence. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with five sepals that resemble petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
