    "intro": "Roupala corcovadensis, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a species of flowering plant in the family Proteaceae. It is native to Brazil and is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood, which is highly valued for its acoustic properties. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree, reaching heights of up to 15 meters. Its leaves are leathery and elliptical, with a glossy green surface, and it produces small, white or pinkish flowers. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species, prompting conservation efforts to protect its natural habitat."
