    "intro": "Rhus denudata, commonly known as smooth sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are alternate and consist of 15 to 31 leaflets that turn a striking red in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by red, fuzzy berries that are a food source for birds and other wildlife. Smooth sumac thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in dry, open woods or along roadsides. Its botanical features make it an important component of native plant communities and a valuable plant for ecological restoration projects."
