    "intro": "Riddellia gnaphalioides, commonly known as the slender sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial that typically forms dense mats of foliage. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Riddellia gnaphalioides is often found in sandy or rocky soils, thriving in full sun and displaying a unique ecological role in its native habitat."
