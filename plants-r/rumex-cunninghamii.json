It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and upright flowering stems that bear small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils in alpine and subalpine regions. Its leaves are edible and have a tart, sour taste, making it a traditional food source for some Indigenous communities. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity in its native habitat."
