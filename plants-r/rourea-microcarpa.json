    "intro": "Rourea microcarpa, commonly known as the dwarf rourea, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, woody stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, followed by spherical, red berries that are edible. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated as a garden plant."
