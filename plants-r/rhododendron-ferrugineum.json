It features dense, leathery leaves that are typically dark green with a rusty or reddish underside. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Rhododendron ferrugineum plays an important role in alpine ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
