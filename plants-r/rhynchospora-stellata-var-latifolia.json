    "intro": "Rhynchospora stellata var. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved star sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy habitats in North America. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth and narrow, linear leaves that are often broad at the base. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in dense inflorescences. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swampy areas or along the edges of ponds. This variety is distinguished by its broader leaf blades compared to the typical form of R. stellata."
