    "intro": "Rumex acetosa subsp. acetosa, commonly known as sourdock, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its upright, sometimes branched stems and alternate, broadly ovate to rhombic leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in dense, terminal clusters, which are typically surrounded by bracts. Its leaves are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, giving them a rough texture. The plant is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in open fields, where it thrives in full sun."
