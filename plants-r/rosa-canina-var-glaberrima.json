It is a shrub native to parts of Europe and western Asia, characterized by its thornless stems and fragrant pink flowers. The leaves are pinnately compound, with five to seven leaflets that are oval and serrated. Its hips, which are reddish-orange and fleshy, contain seeds and are used in traditional medicine and culinary applications. This variety is less commonly cultivated than other rosa canina types but is valued for its ornamental and ecological benefits."
