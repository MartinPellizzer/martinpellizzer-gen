    "intro": "Ranunculus natans f. microphyllus, commonly known as the lesser water buttercup, is a aquatic plant characterized by its small, delicate leaves and yellow flowers. It typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and ditches. The plant's leaves are floating or submerged, with a waxy surface that aids in water retention. Its flowers are usually borne on short stems and bloom in early summer. This variety is distinguished by its reduced leaf size compared to the typical Ranunculus natans."
