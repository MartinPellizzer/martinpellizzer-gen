    "intro": "Rhododendron crassimedium, commonly known as the broad-leaved rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia, particularly China. It is characterized by its large, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces showy, clustered flowers that range in color from pink to red, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is often cultivated in horticultural settings."
