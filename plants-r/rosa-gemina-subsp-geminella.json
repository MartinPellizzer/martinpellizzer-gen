    "intro": "Rosa gemina subsp. geminella, commonly known as the twin rose, is a subspecies native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically has dark green, serrated leaves and produces rose hips that are red and slightly hairy. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or alpine settings. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
