    "intro": "Rubus arvicola, commonly known as the alpine raspberry, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its erect, spiny stems and dense clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers. The plant produces small, red berries that are typically edible and have a tart flavor. It thrives in alpine and subalpine environments, often growing in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes. Rubus arvicola plays an important role in its ecosystem by providing food for wildlife and contributing to soil stabilization in harsh mountainous terrain."
