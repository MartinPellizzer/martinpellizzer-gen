    "intro": "Rivina puberula, commonly known as silky rivina, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, featuring soft, hairy stems and oval, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are usually pink or red, which bloom in the spring and summer. Its showy flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, making it a valuable addition to native gardens. Rivina puberula thrives in partial to full sun and well-drained soil, preferring moist to mesic habitats."
