    "intro": "Ranunculus membranaceus var. stracheyanus, commonly known as Strachey's buttercup, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It is a member of the Ranunculaceae family, characterized by its showy, usually yellow or orange flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine or subalpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils and cool climates. Its leaves are palmately divided, and the flowers are often borne on long, slender stems. This variant is distinguished by its slightly different leaf morphology and floral characteristics compared to the typical form of Ranunculus membranaceus."
