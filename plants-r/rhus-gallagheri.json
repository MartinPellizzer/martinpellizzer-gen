    "intro": "Rhus gallagheri, commonly known as the Gallagher's inkberry, is a species of flowering plant in the Anacardiaceae family. It is native to the southeastern United States, particularly found in wetland areas and along the edges of swamps. The plant is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, dark purple to black berries that appear in the fall. Its leaves are typically glossy and oval-shaped, providing ornamental value in shaded landscapes. Rhus gallagheri is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in moist, acidic soils."
