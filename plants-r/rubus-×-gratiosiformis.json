It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and dark green, leathery leaves that remain on the plant year-round. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black in color, with a tart flavor. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is cultivated in gardens and natural landscapes."
