    "intro": "Ranunculus carlittensis, commonly known as the Carlitt's buttercup, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features showy, yellow flowers with five to eight petals, typically appearing in early spring. The plant has trifoliate leaves that are deeply lobed and covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
