    "intro": "Rhododendron adenophorum, commonly known as the Himalayan rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Asia, including Nepal, Bhutan, and northern India. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to white. The plant typically grows in cool, humid environments at high altitudes, often in forested areas with well-drained soil. Its flowers bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Rhododendron adenophorum is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological role in supporting biodiversity in its native habitats."
