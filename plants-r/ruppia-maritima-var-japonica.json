    "intro": "Ruppia maritima var. japonica, commonly known as Japanese sea rocket, is a halophytic plant that thrives in brackish or saline environments. It is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves and produces tiny, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. This variety is native to coastal regions of East Asia, including Japan and parts of China. It plays a vital role in stabilizing sediments and supporting aquatic ecosystems. Its adaptability to high salinity makes it an important species in coastal restoration projects."
