    "intro": "Rebutia nitida, commonly known as the silver cholla, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical stems that are covered in small, white spines, giving it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically short-lived but attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Rebutia nitida is a low-maintenance plant that thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Its compact size and unique appearance make it a striking addition to desert gardens and rockeries."
