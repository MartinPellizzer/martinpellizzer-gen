    "intro": "Rosa canina var. rugosa, commonly known as the dog rose or rough rose, is a shrub native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and small, pink or white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces aggregate fruits called rosehips, which are rich in vitamin C and often used in herbal remedies. Its leaves are palmately lobed and covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. Rosa canina var. rugosa is well adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in hedgerows and woodland edges."
