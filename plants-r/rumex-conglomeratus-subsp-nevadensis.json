    "intro": "Rumex conglomeratus subsp. nevadensis, commonly known as the Nevada dock, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils along streambanks and in meadows. The plant has basal rosettes of broad, lobed leaves and produces erect flowering stems with small, greenish flowers. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native insects."
