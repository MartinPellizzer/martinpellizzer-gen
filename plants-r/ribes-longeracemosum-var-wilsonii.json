    "intro": "Ribes longeracemosum var. wilsonii, commonly known as Wilson's gooseberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of western China. It features compound leaves with elongated, acuminate leaflets that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are followed by edible, tart berries that ripen in late summer. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its vibrant autumn foliage, which turns a striking red or orange. This variety is valued in horticulture for its hardiness and aesthetic appeal in shaded garden settings."
