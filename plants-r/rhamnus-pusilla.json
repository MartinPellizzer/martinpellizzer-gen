    "intro": "Rhamnus pusilla, commonly known as dwarf buckthorn, is a small evergreen shrub native to the western United States. It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 3 feet and features dense, glossy dark green leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by black, spherical berries that are a food source for birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal scrub and chaparral habitats. Rhamnus pusilla is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate drought conditions."
