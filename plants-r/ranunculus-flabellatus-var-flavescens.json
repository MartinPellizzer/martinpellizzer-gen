It features bright yellow flowers with five to seven petals, and its leaves are deeply divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, streambanks, and damp woodlands. It has a short, stout rhizome and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant is often found in disturbed or nutrient-rich soils and can sometimes be invasive in certain regions."
