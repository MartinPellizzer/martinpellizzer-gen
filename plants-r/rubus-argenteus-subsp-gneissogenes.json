    "intro": "Rubus argenteus subsp. gneissogenes, commonly known as the gneiss rock raspberry, is a shrub native to the rocky, alpine regions of western North America. It is characterized by its silver-white undersides on its leaves, which help reflect intense sunlight in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible and often used in local foraging traditions. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils, typically found on exposed rock outcrops and cliffs. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
