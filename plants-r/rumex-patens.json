    "intro": "Rumex patens, commonly known as wandering knight, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features upright, branching stems covered in reddish hairs, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a distinctive wavy margin. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in wetlands. Rumex patens is notable for its ability to spread vegetatively through rhizomes, contributing to its widespread distribution."
