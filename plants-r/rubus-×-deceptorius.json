    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 deceptorius, commonly known as the deceptive raspberry. This hybrid plant is a cross between Rubus idaeus (red raspberry) and Rubus chamaemorus (cloudberry), resulting in a unique combination of traits. It exhibits a thorny stem with alternate, pinnately compound leaves that have serrated edges. The flowers are typically white or pale yellow, with five petals and numerous stamens. The fruit is a aggregate of small drupes, which can range in color from yellow to orange, and is often consumed for its tart, aromatic flavor."
