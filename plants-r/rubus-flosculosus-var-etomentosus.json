    "intro": "Rubus flosculosus var. etomentosus, commonly known as the woolly raspberry, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in the spring, followed by red, hairy berries that are typically edible. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas or along stream banks. The variety is notable for its dense pubescence, which provides protection against herbivory and environmental stress."
