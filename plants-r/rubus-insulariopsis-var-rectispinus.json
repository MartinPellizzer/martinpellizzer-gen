    "intro": "Rubus insulariopsis var. rectispinus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf blackberry, is a shrub native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its slender, thorny stems and small, elliptical leaves with a smooth upper surface. The plant produces aggregate fruits, known as drupelets, which are typically dark purple to black when mature. It thrives in coastal and upland habitats, often growing in dry, sunny environments. Due to its limited distribution and unique adaptations, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in Hawaii."
