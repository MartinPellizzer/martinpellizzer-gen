    "intro": "Riedelia flava, commonly known as the yellow riedelia, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences, and it is often found in moist, shaded habitats. Riedelia flava is not widely cultivated but is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution. Its conservation status remains uncertain due to habitat loss and limited research."
