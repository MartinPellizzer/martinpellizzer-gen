    "intro": "Rubus silurum, commonly known as Silurian blackberry, is a species of bramble native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a shrub that typically grows in woodland and hedgerow environments, often thriving in moist, shaded conditions. The plant produces small, dark berries that are edible but have a somewhat tart flavor. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and its stems are covered in stiff, prickly hairs. Rubus silurum plays an important role in supporting local wildlife, particularly insects and birds."
