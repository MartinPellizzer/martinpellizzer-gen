    "intro": "Rhus terebinthifolia var. pilosissima, commonly known as the silky sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its finely hairy, compound leaves that are often described as silky to the touch. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in panicles, which are followed by red, fuzzy berries that are a striking feature in the fall. The leaves and fruits are used in traditional medicine and as a source of natural dyes. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks."
