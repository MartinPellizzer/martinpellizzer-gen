    "intro": "Rumex acetosella subsp. arenicola, commonly known as sand sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to sandy and calcareous soils in temperate regions. It features slender, upright stems and trifoliate leaves with reddish veins, which are characteristic of the Rumex genus. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in dense clusters during the spring and early summer. It is adapted to poor, well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as dunes, heaths, and grasslands. Its botanical features make it an important component of ecological studies in arid and semi-arid environments."
