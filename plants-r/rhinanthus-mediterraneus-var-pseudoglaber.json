    "intro": "Rhinanthus mediterraneus var. pseudoglaber, commonly known as the Mediterranean yellow-rattle, is a flowering plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on its host plants for water and nutrients while still performing photosynthesis. This plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as grasslands and sandy soils. Its flowers are yellow and clustered in racemes, blooming from late spring to early summer. It plays a role in supporting pollinators and is of interest in ecological studies due to its parasitic nature and habitat specificity."
