    "intro": "Rhamnus xanthocarpa, commonly known as the yellow-fruited buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to parts of Asia, including China and the Himalayas. It is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and small, simple leaves that are alternate along the stems. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by distinctive yellow berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
