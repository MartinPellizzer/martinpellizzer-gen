    "intro": "Rutidea membranacea, commonly known as the parchment legume, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, papery leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and shrublands. Its unique leaf structure, with thin, membranous blades, helps it conserve water in its native habitat. Rutidea membranacea is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
