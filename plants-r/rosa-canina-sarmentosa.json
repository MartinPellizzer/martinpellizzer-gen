    "intro": "Rosa canina sarmentosa, commonly known as the creeping dogwood rose, is a shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features arching stems that root at the nodes, forming a dense, low-growing mat. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits called hips. Its leaves are oval with serrated edges and a slightly hairy texture. Rosa canina sarmentosa is often used in hedges or ground cover due to its hardiness and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
