    "intro": "Rhytiglossa verticillaris, commonly known as the spiral leaf fern, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its unique, spirally arranged fronds that give it a distinctive and elegant appearance. The plant's leaves are typically elongated and possess a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in its humid, shaded habitats. It thrives in well-draining, nutrient-rich substrates and requires high humidity and indirect light for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in tropical gardens and greenhouses."
