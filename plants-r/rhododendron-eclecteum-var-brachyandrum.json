It features dense, leathery foliage that is dark green and glossy, with a broad, rounded growth habit. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink and white, typically blooming in late spring. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens and woodland settings. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in cooler climates."
