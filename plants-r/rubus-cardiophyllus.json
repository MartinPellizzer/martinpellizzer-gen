    "intro": "Rubus cardiophyllus, commonly known as the heart-leaved raspberry, is a species of brambles native to certain regions of Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive heart-shaped leaves, which are usually serrated and have a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or yellow when mature. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its unique morphology and habitat preferences, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
