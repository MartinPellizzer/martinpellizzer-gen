    "intro": "Rubiteucris palmata, commonly known as the red-veined palm, is a tropical plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, palmately lobed leaves that display a vibrant red underside, contrasting with its green upper surface. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which bloom in clusters. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from the nutrient-poor soils of its natural habitat. The species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments."
