    "intro": "Rosa dumalis f. semiglandulosa, commonly known as the semi-glandular wild rose, is a botanical variant of the species Rosa dumalis. It is characterized by its semi-glandular stipules, which are smaller and less prominent than those of the typical form. The plant produces fragrant, pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its foliage is typically dark green with a slightly hairy texture. This form is often found in rocky or woodland habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
