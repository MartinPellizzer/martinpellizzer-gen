    "intro": "Rhus toxicodendron subsp. radicans, commonly known as staghorn sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes furrowed with age, and its compound leaves that are arranged in pairs along the stems. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red, fuzzy berries in the fall. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in open woods, along streambanks, and in disturbed areas. Due to its allergenic properties, it can cause skin irritation in some individuals."
