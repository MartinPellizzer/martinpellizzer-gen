    "intro": "Rumex conglomeratus var. vulgaris, commonly known as common sorrel, is a herbaceous perennial plant belonging to the Polygonaceae family. It features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive reddish or purple coloration on the underside, which becomes more pronounced as the plant matures. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It is often found in moist, disturbed soils such as roadsides, meadows, and woodland edges. The plant is characterized by its edible leaves, which have a tangy, sour flavor due to the presence of oxalic acid."
