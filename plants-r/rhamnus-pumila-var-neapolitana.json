    "intro": "Rhamnus pumila var. neapolitana, commonly known as the Naples buckthorn, is a low-growing shrub native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, dark green leaves that remain throughout the winter. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by black, egg-shaped berries that are an important food source for birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated as an ornamental plant in gardens."
