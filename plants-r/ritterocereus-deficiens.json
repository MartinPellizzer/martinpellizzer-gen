    "intro": "Ritterocereus deficiens, commonly known as the deficient night-blooming cereus, is a species of cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its spiny stems and nocturnal flowering habit, with large, fragrant white flowers that open at night. The plant thrives in arid environments and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to desert conditions. Its flowers are typically short-lived, lasting only a few hours, and are pollinated by nocturnal insects such as moths. This species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and ease of cultivation."
