    "intro": "Rubus caesius var. armatus, commonly known as the armed blackberry, is a species of brambles native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and dark purple to black berries that ripen in late summer. The plant typically grows in woodland edges, hedgerows, and disturbed soils, preferring moist, well-drained conditions. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the flowers are white with five petals. The fruit is edible, though the plant's prickly nature makes harvesting challenging."
