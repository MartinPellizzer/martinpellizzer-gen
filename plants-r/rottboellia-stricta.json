    "intro": "Rottboellia stricta, commonly known as the common panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit, with slender, upright stems and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in lawns, roadsides, and agricultural fields. Rottboellia stricta is notable for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in many environments."
