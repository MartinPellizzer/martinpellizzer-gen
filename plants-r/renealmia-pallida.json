    "intro": "Renealmia pallida, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking plant native to the wetlands of South America. It is a member of the orchid family and is characterized by its pale, almost translucent leaves and its elongated, slender inflorescence. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, and they bloom in a spiral pattern along the stem. Due to its limited habitat and vulnerability to environmental changes, Renealmia pallida is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
