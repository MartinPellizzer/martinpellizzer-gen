    "intro": "Rosa pugetii var. genuina, commonly known as the Puget Sound rock rose, is a compact shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its dense, upright growth habit and produces clusters of fragrant, pink to red flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant has dark green, leathery leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white, waxy hair, which helps it retain moisture in its native habitat. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. This variety is notable for its ornamental value and its ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions."
