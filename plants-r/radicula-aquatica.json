    "intro": "Radicula aquatica, commonly known as water radish, is a herbaceous plant that thrives in wetland environments. It features slender, ribbon-like leaves that float on the surface of water or grow just below it. The plant produces small, white flowers that are often clustered together, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its roots are fibrous and can spread widely, helping to stabilize the soil in aquatic habitats. Radicula aquatica is often used in traditional medicine for its purported diuretic and anti-inflammatory properties."
