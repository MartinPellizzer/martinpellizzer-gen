It is a natural hybrid between Ribes aureum (gold gooseberry) and Ribes rubrum (red gooseberry), resulting in a plant that exhibits characteristics of both parents. The plant typically grows to a height of 1\u20132 meters and produces clusters of small, edible berries that range in color from yellow to red depending on the variety. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have serrated edges, while its flowers are usually pink or white and appear in clusters. Ribes \u00d7 schneideri is often cultivated for its ornamental value and for the production of tart berries used in jams and wines."
