    "intro": "Rumex dentatus subsp. nigricans, commonly known as the black-stem dock, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges and dark green, often hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on slender, upright stems. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a common weed in disturbed soils. The species is adapted to a variety of soil types but prefers moist, nutrient-rich environments."
