    "intro": "Rubus begoniaefolius, commonly known as the begonia-leaf raspberry, is a shrub native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its dense, thorny growth habit and compound leaves that resemble those of begonias, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or black when mature. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in high-altitude regions. Due to its ornamental value and unique foliage, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens."
