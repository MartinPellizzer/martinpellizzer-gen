    "intro": "Ranunculus uxoris, commonly known as the lady's mantle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its deeply lobed, palmately divided leaves that resemble a cloak, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Ranunculus uxoris thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and traditional herbal medicine."
