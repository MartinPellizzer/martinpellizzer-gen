    "intro": "Restio rarus, commonly known as the rare restio, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Restionaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny white or pale blue flowers. Restio rarus thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal dunes or fynbos vegetation. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
