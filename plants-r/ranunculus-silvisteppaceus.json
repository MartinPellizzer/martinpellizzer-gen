It typically grows in meadows, forest edges, and steppe environments, thriving in well-drained soils. The plant features a short, fibrous root system and produces basal leaves that are palmately divided with serrated edges. Its flowers are bright yellow, with five petal-like sepals and numerous stamens, typical of the Ranunculaceae family. It is often found in disturbed or transitional habitats, contributing to the biodiversity of its ecosystem."
