It features slender, arching stems covered in fine, soft hairs, which give it its varietal name. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink to white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its foliage is dark green and slightly hairy, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and is often used in native gardens for its ecological value and aesthetic qualities."
