    "intro": "Rebutia pulvinosa, commonly known as the snowball cactus, is a succulent plant native to South America. It features a compact, branching structure with fleshy, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces showy, white or pale pink flowers in rounded clusters, resembling snowballs, typically during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are small, oval, and often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Rebutia pulvinosa is well-suited for rock gardens or containers, requiring minimal water and full sun to bloom successfully."
