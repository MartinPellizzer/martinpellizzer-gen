    "intro": "Russelia furfuracea, commonly known as the velvetleaf russelia, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to red, which bloom in clusters along the stems. The plant has velvety, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, almost fuzzy texture. It thrives in warm, humid environments and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant. Russelia furfuracea is also valued for its ability to attract hummingbirds and other pollinators."
