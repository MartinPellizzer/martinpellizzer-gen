    "intro": "Rubus fragaria, commonly known as the wild strawberry, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and produces small, edible fruits that are rich in antioxidants. The plant has trifoliate leaves with serrated edges and produces white flowers that bloom in early summer. Its fruits are often used in culinary applications, though they are distinct from the cultivated strawberries (Fragaria vesca). The plant is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and thrives in well-drained soils."
