    "intro": "Ricinocarpus brachystachyus, commonly known as the dwarf sago palm, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its short, clustered stems and pinnate leaves that give it a palm-like appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by dark blue, fleshy berries. Its leaves contain cycasin, a toxic compound similar to the poison in sago palm, which makes it hazardous if ingested. The plant is often cultivated as an ornamental due to its unique foliage and compact size."
