    "intro": "Rubus elgonensis, commonly known as Elgon blackberry, is a shrub native to the high-altitude regions of East Africa, particularly around Mount Elgon. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, dark purple to black berries. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters. Its leaves are compound, with three to five leaflets, and the flowers are white with five petals. The fruit is edible, though it is often used in local traditional medicine and as a source of income for rural communities."
