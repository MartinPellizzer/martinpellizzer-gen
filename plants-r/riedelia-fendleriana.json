    "intro": "Riedelia fendleriana, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in rocky soils and desert environments. The plant features showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink, often blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. Riedelia fendleriana is valued for its ornamental beauty and resilience in harsh conditions."
