    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 perdolosus, commonly known as the blackberry bramble, is a hybrid plant species within the Rubus genus. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves, which are typical of many bramble species. The plant produces aggregate fruits, which are composed of small, drupe-like berries clustered together. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils. Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits a wide range of morphological variations."
