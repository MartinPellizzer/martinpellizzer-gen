    "intro": "Ruellia caroliniensis var. membranacea, commonly known as the Carolina rosemallow, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features heart-shaped, palmately lobed leaves that are typically velvety and green, with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of blue or purple, which bloom from summer to fall. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for wetland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
