    "intro": "Ranunculus fallax subsp. daedalus, commonly known as the Daedalus buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its striking, yellow-orange flowers with a distinctive, deeply lobed petal structure. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky habitats and has a fibrous root system that helps it anchor in challenging terrain. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a hairy texture that aids in water retention. The species is noted for its ecological importance, providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a food source for certain herbivores."
