    "intro": "Rhododendron caespitulum, commonly known as the dwarf rhododendron, is a compact evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of China. It features dense, dark green foliage with a mat-forming growth habit, making it ideal for rock gardens or as a ground cover. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to red, typically blooming in late spring. It prefers well-drained acidic soils and partial to full shade, thriving in cool, moist environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is a popular choice for gardeners in temperate climates."
