    "intro": "Ranunculus pseudomonophyllus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and stream banks. The plant features a basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves and produces yellow flowers with five petals. Its flowers are usually less than 2 cm in diameter and have numerous stamens. It is characterized by its unique leaf structure, which distinguishes it from other ranunculus species."
