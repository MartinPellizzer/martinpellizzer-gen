    "intro": "Rebutia euanthema, commonly known as the Easter cactus, is a species of flowering cactus native to Brazil. It is characterized by its compact, rounded shape and vibrant, showy flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has thick, ribbed stems that store water, enabling it to thrive in arid conditions. Its leaves are typically modified into spines, and it produces bright orange or red flowers. Rebutia euanthema is well-suited for indoor cultivation and requires well-draining soil and bright, indirect light."
