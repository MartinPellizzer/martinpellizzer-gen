    "intro": "Roegneria arcuata, commonly known as the bentgrass, is a cool-season grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its low-growing, creeping growth habit and fine, soft blades that often form dense mats. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lawns, meadows, and along stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of narrow, spike-like clusters of small, spikelet-bearing flowers. Roegneria arcuata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in turfgrass management due to its durability and adaptability."
