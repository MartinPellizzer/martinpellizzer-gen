    "intro": "Rosa klukii var. trichophylla, commonly known as the Trichophylla rose, is a rare and unique variant of the Rosa klukii species. It is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage, which gives it a distinctive tactile quality. The plant typically produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white, often blooming in early summer. It is native to specific regions in the Pacific Northwest of the United States, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and unique botanical features, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical study and conservation efforts."
