    "intro": "Rhinanthus groenlandicus, commonly known as Greenland touchroot, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, which includes many parasitic and hemiparasitic species. The plant typically grows in open, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in tundra or alpine environments. It produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. Its root system is specialized, allowing it to absorb nutrients from nearby plants, making it a hemiparasite."
