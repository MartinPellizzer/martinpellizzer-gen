    "intro": "Rhamnus alaternus var. elliptica, commonly known as the elliptic buckthorn, is a shrub native to southern Europe and the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, thorny growth and dark green, elliptical leaves that are glossy and leathery in texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by black, spherical berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or dry habitats. Its hardy nature makes it a resilient plant in Mediterranean climates."
