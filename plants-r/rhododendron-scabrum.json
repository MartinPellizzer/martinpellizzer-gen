    "intro": "Rhododendron scabrum, commonly known as the roughleaf rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Asia, particularly in China, Nepal, and India. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage with a rough, scaly texture on the leaves. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Rhododendron scabrum is often found in forested areas at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,500 meters."
