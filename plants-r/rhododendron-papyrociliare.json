    "intro": "Rhododendron papyrociliare, commonly known as the paper-haired rhododendron, is a species native to the Himalayas, particularly in regions of Nepal and India. It is characterized by its dense, moss-like foliage and showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments at high altitudes, often in forested areas. Its leaves are leathery and covered with fine, hair-like structures, which give it its common name. Rhododendron papyrociliare is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological balance of its native habitat."
