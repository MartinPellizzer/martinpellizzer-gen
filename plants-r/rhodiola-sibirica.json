    "intro": "Rhodiola sibirica, commonly known as the Siberian rhodiola, is a perennial flowering plant native to the cold climates of Siberia, the Caucasus, and Central Asia. It belongs to the Crassulaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, succulent stems and leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer months. Rhodiola sibirica is adapted to harsh environments, with a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils. It is also known for its medicinal properties and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported adaptogenic and energizing effects."
