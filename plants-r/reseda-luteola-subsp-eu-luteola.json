It is a member of the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its yellow, clustered flowers and hairy stems. The plant typically grows in grasslands and disturbed soils, often as a biennial or perennial. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that release seeds through a mechanical mechanism. Its botanical features make it an important component of ecological systems, particularly in supporting pollinators and soil stability."
