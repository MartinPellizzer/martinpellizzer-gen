    "intro": "Roegneria cacuminis, commonly known as the purple false brome, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that are often tinged with purple or reddish hues. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as meadows, marshes, and streambanks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration that becomes more pronounced in cooler conditions. Roegneria cacuminis is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments."
