    "intro": "Restrepia iris, commonly known as the iris orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is characterized by its striking, iris-like flowers that range in color from white to deep purple. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees or rocks in its natural habitat. Its leaves are long and strap-like, often forming a rosette at the base. Restrepia iris thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth."
