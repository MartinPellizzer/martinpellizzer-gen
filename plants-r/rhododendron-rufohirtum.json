    "intro": "Rhododendron rufohirtum, commonly known as the red-haired rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia, particularly in China, India, and Nepal. It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are often covered in fine, rusty-brown hairs, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to deep red, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is also valued for its role in supporting local biodiversity."
