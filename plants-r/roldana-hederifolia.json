    "intro": "Roldana hederifolia, commonly known as the ivy-leaved bellflower, is a flowering plant native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, velvety leaves and clusters of bell-shaped blue or violet flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas and is often found in woodland environments. It has a creeping habit with trailing stems that can root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. Roldana hederifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and blooms."
