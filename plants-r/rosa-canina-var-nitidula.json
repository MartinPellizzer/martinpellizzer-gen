    "intro": "Rosa canina var. nitidula, commonly known as the smooth hips rose, is a variant of the dog rose native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, shiny fruits that are typically orange to red in color, distinguishing it from the more common rough-hairy hips of Rosa canina. The plant produces fragrant pink to white flowers in spring, followed by the characteristic rose hips in autumn. It is a deciduous shrub that thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in hedgerows and woodland edges. Its hips are valued for their ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal medicine."
