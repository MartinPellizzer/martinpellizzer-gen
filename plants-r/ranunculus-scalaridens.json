    "intro": "Ranunculus scalaridens, commonly known as the scalycup buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a basal rosette of finely toothed, lanceolate leaves that are covered in a dense layer of silky hairs. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with five to eight petals, often with a distinctive scalloped edge. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is typically found in alpine meadows and forest edges. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain environments."
