    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 neurophanes, commonly known as the blackberry-boys or bramble hybrids, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Rubus ursinus (the blackberry) and Rubus glaucus (the raspberries). It is characterized by its thorny stems and aggregate fruits that typically range from dark purple to black in color. The plant thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils. Its botanical features include trifoliate leaves and a complex flowering structure that supports pollination by insects. This hybrid is valued for its ornamental appeal and edible fruits, though it can be invasive in certain environments."
