    "intro": "Rhamnus frangula var. torsacea, commonly known as the twisted buckthorn, is a shrub native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its woody stems that exhibit a twisting growth habit, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by dark blue berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have serrated edges, contributing to its ornamental value. The species is often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils, where it thrives in partial shade to full sun."
