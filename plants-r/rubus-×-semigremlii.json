    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 semigremlii, commonly known as the hybrid blackberry raspberry, is a deciduous shrub belonging to the Rosaceae family. It is a natural hybrid between Rubus ursinus (blackberry) and Rubus chamaemorus (cloudberry), resulting in a unique combination of traits from both parents. The plant produces small, red to orange berries that are typically tart and acidic, with a complex flavor profile. It thrives in cool, temperate climates and is often found in moist, acidic soils. Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits a wide range of morphological and genetic variability."
