    "intro": "Rumex acetosa var. maximus, commonly known as sour dock, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a robust, upright stem with large, heart-shaped leaves that have a distinctive wavy margin. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its roots are thick and fleshy, often used in traditional medicine for their astringent properties. Sour dock is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in moist meadows."
