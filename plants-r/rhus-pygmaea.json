    "intro": "Rhus pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf sumac, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically three to five leaflets arranged oppositely. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers in the spring, followed by red, fuzzy berries that attract birds. Rhus pygmaea thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an important component of riparian ecosystems."
