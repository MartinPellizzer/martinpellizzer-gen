    "intro": "Rosa piscatoria, commonly known as water rose, is a perennial aquatic plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It thrives in shallow freshwater environments such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. The plant has slender, branching stems that often float on the water surface, with small, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or white. Its leaves are oval-shaped and have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small fish and invertebrates."
