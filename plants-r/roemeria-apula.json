    "intro": "Roemeria apula, commonly known as the Apulian roemeria, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the southern regions of Italy. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes familiar plants like carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. Roemeria apula thrives in rocky, calcareous soils and is often found in Mediterranean climates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
