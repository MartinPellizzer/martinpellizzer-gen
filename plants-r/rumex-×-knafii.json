    "intro": "Rumex \u00d7 knafii, commonly known as the hybrid sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its upright growth habit and broad, arrow-shaped leaves. It belongs to the Polygonaceae family and is known for its edible leaves, which have a tart, sour flavor due to the presence of oxalic acid. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in dense clusters, typically during the spring and summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or disturbed areas. Due to its hybrid nature, Rumex \u00d7 knafii exhibits a mix of traits from its parent species, Rumex acetosa and Rumex patientia."
