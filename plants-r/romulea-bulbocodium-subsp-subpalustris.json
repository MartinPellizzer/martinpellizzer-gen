    "intro": "Romulea bulbocodium subsp. subpalustris, commonly known as the marsh bulbous orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its grass-like leaves and showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy or gravelly soils in wetland or marshy habitats. It produces a bulbous corm as a storage organ, which allows it to survive dry periods and regrow in the wet season. This subspecies is often found in areas with high humidity and is adapted to seasonal flooding."
