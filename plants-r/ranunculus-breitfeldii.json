    "intro": "Ranunculus breitfeldii, commonly known as the Breitfeld buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features delicate, palmately divided leaves and showy yellow flowers with five to nine petals. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
