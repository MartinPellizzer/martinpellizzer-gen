    "intro": "Rogersonanthus tepuiensis, commonly known as the tepui bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the highlands of the Guiana Shield in South America. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, white or pale blue flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at elevations above 1,500 meters. Its unique morphology and restricted habitat make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered endangered and is often found in cloud forests on tepuis, which are isolated mountain ranges."
