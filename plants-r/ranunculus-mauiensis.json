It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family, characterized by its showy, often brightly colored flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or rocky areas. Its leaves are deeply lobed, and its flowers feature five to seven petals, usually in shades of yellow or white. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, it is considered endangered and is protected under conservation efforts."
