    "intro": "Rubus serpens subsp. oliganthus, commonly known as the narrowleaf blackberry, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, thornless stems and trifoliate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark red to black when mature. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. Its botanical features make it distinguishable from other Rubus species, particularly in its leaf morphology and fruit structure."
