    "intro": "Romanzoffia glauca, commonly known as the blue marsh orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, delicate blue or violet flowers during the summer months. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its flowering period typically spans from June to August, and it plays a role in supporting local pollinator populations. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator species for wetland health."
