    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 pseudocontractifolius, commonly known as the blackberry bramble, is a hybrid species within the Rubus genus. It is characterized by its thorny stems and aggregate fruits, which are typically dark purple to black when mature. The plant is native to parts of Europe and Asia, where it thrives in temperate climates. Its leaves are compound, usually with three to five leaflets, and are covered in fine hairs. The fruit, while edible, is often used in jams and pies due to its tart flavor and high pectin content."
