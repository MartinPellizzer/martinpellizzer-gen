    "intro": "Rosa villosa var. agriensis, commonly known as the Agriensian brambles, is a deciduous shrub native to Central Europe. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, white to pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The leaves are compound, with serrated edges and a soft, hairy texture. This variety is adapted to a wide range of soil types and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed areas. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in hedgerows and as a source of edible hips."
