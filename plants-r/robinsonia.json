    "intro": "Robinsonia, commonly known as the golden-eyed daisy, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid regions. The plant is characterized by its showy, yellow flower heads that resemble daisies, with bright orange or yellow central disks. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, hard seeds that are dispersed by wind. Robinsonia species are often grown in gardens for their ornamental value and drought tolerance."
