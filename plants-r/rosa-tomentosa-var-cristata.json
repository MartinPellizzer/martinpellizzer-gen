    "intro": "Rosa tomentosa var. cristata, commonly known as the woolly rose or cushion rose, is a unique variety of the woolly rose species. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit, forming low, rounded mounds of foliage. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are covered in a fine, white tomentum, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. This variety is well-suited for rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its compact growth and hardy nature."
