    "intro": "Rosa arvensis var. pervirens, commonly known as the creeping red sanders, is a perennial shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit, with stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant produces fragrant, pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are compound, consisting of five to seven oval-shaped leaflets, and are covered in fine hairs. This species is often found in disturbed soils and is sometimes considered a weed due to its aggressive spreading nature."
