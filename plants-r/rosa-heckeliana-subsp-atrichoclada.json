    "intro": "Rosa heckeliana subsp. atrichoclada, commonly known as the black-haired Rosa, is a shrub-like plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, thornless stems and dark green, leathery foliage. The plant produces showy, semi-double flowers in shades of pink to red, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in colder climates."
