    "intro": "Rubus schmidelyanus subsp. borreri, commonly known as the alpine raspberry, is a perennial shrub native to high-altitude regions of the Alps. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its prickly stems and clusters of small, white to pink flowers. The plant produces edible red berries that are similar in appearance to those of other Rubus species. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, mountainous climates. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its habitat."
