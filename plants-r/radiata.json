    "intro": "Radiata, commonly known as the radiata pine, is a species of conifer native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and needle-like leaves arranged in bundles of five. The tree produces cones that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Radiata pine is widely cultivated for its timber due to its fast growth and durable wood. It plays an important role in both ecological and economic contexts in its native habitat."
