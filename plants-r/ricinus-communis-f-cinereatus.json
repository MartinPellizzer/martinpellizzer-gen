    "intro": "Ricinus communis f. cinereatus, commonly known as the gray castor plant, is a variant of the castor oil plant characterized by its distinctive grayish-green foliage. The leaves are large, palmately lobed, and often have a velvety texture. This variety is notable for its reduced production of the toxic ricin found in the seeds of the typical castor plant. It is cultivated primarily for ornamental purposes due to its unique appearance. The plant thrives in warm climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
