    "intro": "Rapistrum rugosum subsp. nemausense, commonly known as the roughdock, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist soils along riverbanks and wet meadows, exhibiting a robust root system that aids in stabilizing the soil. The plant features dark green, lance-shaped leaves with a rough texture and prominent veins, and it produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters. It is often found in disturbed habitats and can thrive in partial shade to full sun. Its botanical characteristics make it both ecologically significant and potentially invasive in certain regions."
