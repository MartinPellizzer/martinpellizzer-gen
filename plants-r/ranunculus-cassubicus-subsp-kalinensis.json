It features delicate, palmately divided leaves and bright yellow flowers with five petals. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky habitats, preferring well-drained soils. It is characterized by its short stature and early flowering period, often blooming in late spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
