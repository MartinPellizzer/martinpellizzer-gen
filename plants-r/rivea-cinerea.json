The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers, which are followed by long, slender fruits. It thrives in warm, humid environments and is often cultivated as a decorative plant or for its ornamental value. Rivea cinerea is also known for its ability to climb using its tendrils, making it suitable for trellises or hanging baskets."
