    "intro": "Rhynchospora exaltata f. angusta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved marsh sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are clustered in spikelets, and it plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils. This subspecies is distinguished by its narrower leaf blades compared to the typical form of R. exaltata."
