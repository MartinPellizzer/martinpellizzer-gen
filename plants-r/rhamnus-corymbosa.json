    "intro": "Rhamnus corymbosa, commonly known as the Indian buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Indian subcontinent. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and opposite, ovate leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in corymbs, which are followed by dark blue, egg-shaped berries. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions and full sun. Rhamnus corymbosa is often used in traditional medicine and ornamental horticulture."
