    "intro": "Roscyna gebleri, commonly known as the Christmas bell, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, meaning it attaches itself to the bark of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are broad and glossy, and it produces small, fragrant blooms during the cooler months. Roscyna gebleri is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a houseplant."
