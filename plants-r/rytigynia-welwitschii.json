    "intro": "Rytigynia welwitschii, commonly known as the Welwitschia plant, is a unique and ancient plant native to the Namib Desert in Namibia. It is characterized by its two large, leathery leaves that can grow up to 3 meters in length. The plant has a woody stem that often develops a thick, protective layer to withstand extreme aridity. It produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, typically in the early morning. Due to its rarity and ecological significance, it is considered a living fossil and a symbol of the desert's resilience."
