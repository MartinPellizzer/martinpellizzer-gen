    "intro": "Raimannia littoralis, commonly known as the coastal grass, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It is a perennial herb that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer. It plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion. Due to its adaptability to saline and windy environments, it is often used in ecological restoration projects."
