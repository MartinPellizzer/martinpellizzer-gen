    "intro": "Rabdosiella ternifolia, commonly known as the three-leaf lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is characterized by its delicate, leaf-like thallus that is typically greenish to yellowish in color. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae, which provides the necessary photosynthetic function. It is often found on tree trunks and rocks in temperate regions. Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator of environmental health."
