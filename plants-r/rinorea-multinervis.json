It is characterized by its finely veined, ovate leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on short pedicels. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Rinorea multinervis is often found in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and along riverbanks."
