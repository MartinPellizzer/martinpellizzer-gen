It features delicate, nodding yellow flowers with five sepals that resemble petals, and it typically grows in moist, calcareous soils. The plant has a short, hairy stem that supports its small, palmate leaves. It is characterized by its bulbous root system, which helps it survive in its native habitat. This variety is often found in wet meadows and along streambanks, where it thrives in partial to full sun."
