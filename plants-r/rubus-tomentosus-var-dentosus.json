It is characterized by its thick, woolly foliage and thorny stems, which provide structural support and protection. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that ripen to a dark purple or black color, typically in late summer. Its leaves are typically serrated with a dense covering of fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This variety is often found in moist, wooded areas and is valued for its ornamental and edible qualities."
