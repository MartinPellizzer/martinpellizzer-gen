    "intro": "Rapuntium gibbosum, commonly known as the cushion bellflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features dense, compact growth with fleshy, succulent leaves that form a cushion-like structure. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue, violet, or white, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in Mediterranean-style gardens."
