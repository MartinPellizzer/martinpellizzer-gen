    "intro": "Rhipidia, commonly known as the marsh hibiscus, is a genus of flowering plants in the mallow family, Malvaceae. It consists of several species native to wetland and marshy habitats in tropical and subtropical regions. The plants typically have showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. Their leaves are usually palmately lobed and can be broad or narrow depending on the species. Rhipidia species are often used in wetland restoration projects due to their ability to thrive in waterlogged soils."
