It features heart-shaped, reddish-veined leaves that are edible and often used in traditional cuisines. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forests and along streambanks. Its rhubarb-like leaves contain oxalic acid, making them suitable for cooking when prepared properly."
