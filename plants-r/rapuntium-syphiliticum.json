    "intro": "Rapuntium syphiliticum, commonly known as the syphilitic cress, is a flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and pinnately lobed leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, temperate regions and is often found in disturbed soils. It produces small, edible seeds that are sometimes used in traditional medicine. However, its name suggests a historical association with syphilis, though this link is more cultural than botanical."
