    "intro": "Roentgenia, commonly known as the African violet, is a genus of flowering plants native to Africa. These plants are characterized by their rosette-shaped leaves and showy, tubular flowers that come in a variety of colors. Roentgenia species are typically evergreen and thrive in humid, well-drained soil. They are popular as houseplants due to their compact size and ability to bloom indoors. The genus includes several species, such as Roentgenia kirkii and Roentgenia rufescens, which are valued for their ornamental appeal."
