It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family, characterized by its showy, typically yellow or white flowers. The plant features delicate, palmately divided leaves and produces small, aggregated fruits called achenes. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
