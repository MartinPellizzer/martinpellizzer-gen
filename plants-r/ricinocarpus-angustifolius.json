    "intro": "Ricinocarpus angustifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaved ricin tree, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in panicles. The plant is notable for containing toxic compounds, including ricin, which makes it potentially hazardous. It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in coastal areas or on limestone soils. Due to its toxicity, it is generally avoided for cultivation or use in agriculture."
