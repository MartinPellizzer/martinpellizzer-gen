    "intro": "Ricinocarpus pilosus, commonly known as the hairy sea grape, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of tropical and subtropical areas. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, fleshy fruits. It thrives in saline environments, making it an important component of coastal vegetation. Its ability to tolerate salt spray and sandy soils makes it well adapted to harsh maritime conditions."
