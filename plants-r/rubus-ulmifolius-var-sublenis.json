    "intro": "Rubus ulmifolius var. sublenis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved blackberry, is a shrub native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, arching stems and dark green, serrated leaves that are narrower than those of the typical Rubus ulmifolius. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that ripen to a deep black color, often with a slightly tart flavor. It thrives in woodland edges and disturbed soils, preferring partial shade and well-drained conditions. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its edible berries."
