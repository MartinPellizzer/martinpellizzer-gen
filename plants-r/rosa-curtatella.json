    "intro": "Rosa curtatella, commonly known as the dwarf bank\u73ab\u7470, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically reaches heights of only 10-30 centimeters, with dense, woody stems that are often covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are pinnately compound, consisting of 5-7 oval leaflets with serrated edges. Rosa curtatella is well adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, making it a hardy plant suitable for alpine gardens."
