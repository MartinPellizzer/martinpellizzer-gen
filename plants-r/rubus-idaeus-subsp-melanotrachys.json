    "intro": "Rubus idaeus subsp. melanotrachys, commonly known as blackberry bramble, is a wild species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its thorny stems and aggregate fruits, which develop from multiple ovaria within a single flower. The plant produces dark purple to black berries that are rich in antioxidants and have a distinctive, slightly tart flavor. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It plays an important ecological role by providing food for wildlife and supporting pollinator populations."
