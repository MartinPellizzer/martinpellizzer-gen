    "intro": "Ranunculus gracilior, commonly known as the slender buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the western United States. It features delicate, palmately divided leaves and bright yellow, cup-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It has a short rhizome and produces small, hairy fruits that disperse its seeds. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
