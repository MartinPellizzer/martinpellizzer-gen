    "intro": "Rubus rosulans, commonly known as the rosehip plant, is a deciduous shrub native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves and clusters of small, red, berry-like fruits. The plant produces showy, pink to white flowers in the spring, followed by the development of its distinctive rose hips in the autumn. Its fruits are rich in vitamin C and have been used in traditional medicine and culinary applications. The plant's thorny stems and dense growth habit make it both a hardy ornamental and a potential weed in certain environments."
