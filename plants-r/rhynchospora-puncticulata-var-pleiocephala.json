    "intro": "Rhynchospora puncticulata var. pleiocephala, commonly known as the broad-headed spike-rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that are typically green to reddish in color, with small, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. This variety is distinguished by its broader, more rounded flower heads compared to other varieties of Rhynchospora."
