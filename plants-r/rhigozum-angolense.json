    "intro": "Rhigozum angolense, commonly known as Angola mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and typically grows on the branches of host trees such as acacias and eucalyptus. The plant has small, opposite leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers followed by red berries. It relies on its host for water and nutrients but can photosynthesize to some extent. Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host tree if left unchecked."
