    "intro": "Richteria haidarii, commonly known as the Haidari's spurge, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family, which includes many species with milky sap, a characteristic shared by this plant. The plant features lance-shaped leaves with a waxy surface and produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the summer. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Richteria haidarii is considered endangered in its native range."
