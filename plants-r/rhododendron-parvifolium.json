    "intro": "Rhododendron parvifolium, commonly known as the small-leaved rhododendron, is a deciduous shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It features dense, evergreen foliage with elliptical, leathery leaves that are typically less than 2 inches in length. The plant produces showy clusters of pink to reddish-purple flowers in the spring, which are borne on short pedicels. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Rhododendron parvifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to form dense, low-growing thickets in woodland settings."
