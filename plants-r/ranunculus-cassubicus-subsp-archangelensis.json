    "intro": "Ranunculus cassubicus subsp. archangelensis, commonly known as the Archangel buttercup, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its small, bright yellow flowers with five petals and a hairy, glandular stem. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in tundra or alpine habitats. It has lance-shaped leaves with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss in cold environments. This subspecies is adapted to survive in harsh climates with short growing seasons and is an important component of its ecosystem."
