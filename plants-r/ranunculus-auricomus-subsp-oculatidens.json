    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus subsp. oculatidens, commonly known as the yellow pond-lily, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to parts of Asia. It features showy, yellow flowers with a distinctive, eye-like pattern on the petals, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in shallow freshwater habitats such as ponds and lakes. Its leaves are floating or submerged, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. The subspecies is characterized by its finely divided leaves and its ability to thrive in still or slow-moving water environments."
