    "intro": "Rivina roseo-aenea, commonly known as the roseum aenea or roseate ironvine, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring lance-shaped leaves with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to purple, which bloom in the spring and summer. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and showy inflorescences, making it a popular choice for gardens. The plant prefers well-drained soil and full sun, and it is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
