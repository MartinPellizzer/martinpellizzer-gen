    "intro": "Rubus stramineus, commonly known as the yellow raspberry, is a species of bramble native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its slender, thorny stems and trifoliate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible berries that are typically red or orange in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Rubus stramineus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
