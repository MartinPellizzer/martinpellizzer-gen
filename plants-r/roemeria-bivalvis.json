    "intro": "Roemeria bivalvis, commonly known as the two-valved roemeria, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes plants like carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Roemeria bivalvis is considered a vulnerable species."
