    "intro": "Rubus thelybatos var. dasycarpus, commonly known as the hairy-fruited blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to parts of East Asia. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and dark purple to black berries that ripen in late summer. The plant typically grows as a shrub with thorny stems and compound leaves. Its flowers are small, white, and clustered in dense inflorescences. The berries are often used in culinary applications, though the plant is more valued for its ornamental qualities than for its fruit yield."
