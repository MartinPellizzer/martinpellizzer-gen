    "intro": "Rhabdothamnus negriana, commonly known as the black mountain thorn, is a shrub native to the temperate regions of southern South America. It is characterized by its woody stems and compound leaves with small, serrated leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by woody, spiny fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as hillsides and rocky areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in horticulture for erosion control and ornamental purposes."
