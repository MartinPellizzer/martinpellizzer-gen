It typically grows in moist grasslands, meadows, and along stream banks. The plant features compound leaves with serrated edges and produces fragrant, pink to white flowers in late spring to early summer. Its hips, which are the fruit, are orange-red and contain achenes surrounded by a fleshy outer layer. Rosa arvensis baldensis is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported health benefits."
