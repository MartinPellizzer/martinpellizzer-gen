    "intro": "Ravensara ovalifolia, commonly known as the New Zealand native tree or k\u014dwhai, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to New Zealand. It features lance-shaped leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, with a distinctive waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for native birds. Ravensara ovalifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological significance in its native habitat. It is also used in traditional M\u0101ori medicine for its purported healing properties."
