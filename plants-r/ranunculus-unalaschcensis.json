    "intro": "Ranunculus unalaschcensis, commonly known as the Alaska buttercup, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Alaska and western Canada. It is a member of the Ranunculaceae family, characterized by its showy, often brightly colored flowers. The plant typically has a short stem with palmate leaves and produces yellow or orange flowers with numerous stamens. It thrives in moist, alpine environments and is adapted to cold climates. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator of high-altitude ecosystems."
