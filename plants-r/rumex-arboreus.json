    "intro": "Rumex arboreus, commonly known as the tree sorrel, is a shrub-like plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its upright, woody stems and broad, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are edible, though they contain oxalic acid and should be consumed in moderation. Rumex arboreus is often found in moist, wooded areas and can thrive in partial shade."
