    "intro": "Rhus rudatisii, commonly known as the roughleaf sumac, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Anacardiaceae family, which includes other well-known species like poison ivy and mango. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically divided into three to five leaflets, and its clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in the spring. Rhus rudatisii produces red, fuzzy berries that are a food source for birds and small mammals. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodland edges and stream banks."
