    "intro": "Ranunculus anemonifolius var. calvertii, commonly known as the Calvert's buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It features showy, bright yellow flowers with five to eight petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has palmately divided leaves that are deeply lobed, giving it a delicate, fern-like appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or along stream banks. This variant is distinguished by its specific geographic distribution and subtle morphological differences from other ranunculus species."
