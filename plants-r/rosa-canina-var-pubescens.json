    "intro": "Rosa canina var. pubescens, commonly known as the bristly dog rose, is a shrub native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and pubescent (hairy) surfaces, which give it its botanical name. The plant produces fragrant pink or white flowers in spring, followed by red, fuzzy rosehips that are rich in vitamin C. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with serrated edges, and it thrives in well-drained soils. This variety is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of ornamental plants."
