    "intro": "Rosa macrophylla var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf pink champagne rose, is a compact, shrub-like plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It features dense, thornless stems and produces abundant clusters of fragrant, semi-double pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are dark green, glossy, and broadly elliptical, providing a lush backdrop for the blooms. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and hardiness, thriving in USDA hardiness zones 6 through 9. It is often used in gardens for its aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in partial shade to full sun."
