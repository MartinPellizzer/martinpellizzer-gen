    "intro": "Rubus pyramidalis var. pseudodanicus, commonly known as the false Danish raspberry, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its prickly stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red when ripe, though they are not widely cultivated for consumption. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within the Rubus genus."
