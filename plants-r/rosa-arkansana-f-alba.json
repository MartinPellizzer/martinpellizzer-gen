It is native to the southeastern United States, particularly in Arkansas and neighboring regions. The plant typically grows as a shrub with thorny stems and compound leaves, and it produces fragrant, semi-double flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy perennial suitable for ornamental gardening. The white flower coloration is a distinguishing feature of this form, setting it apart from other rosa species."
