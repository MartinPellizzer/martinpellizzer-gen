    "intro": "Rubus lucorum, commonly known as the dog rose, is a species of shrub native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of white or pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces red or orange hips, which are the fruit and contain a high concentration of vitamin C. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have serrated edges. Rubus lucorum is often found in woodland edges, hedgerows, and disturbed soils, and it plays a role in supporting pollinators and wildlife."
