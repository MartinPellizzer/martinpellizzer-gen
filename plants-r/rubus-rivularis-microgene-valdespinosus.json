    "intro": "Rubus rivularis microgene valdespinosus, commonly known as the Valdespinosa blackberry, is a rare and unique species within the Rubus genus. It is characterized by its small, thorny stems and clusters of dark purple to black berries. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in woodland areas. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the flowers are usually white or pale pink. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a botanically significant and ecologically sensitive species."
