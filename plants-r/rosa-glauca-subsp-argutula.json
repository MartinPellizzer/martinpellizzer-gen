    "intro": "Rosa glauca subsp. argutula, commonly known as the narrow-leaved dog rose, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender stems, lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges, and clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers. The plant produces oval, red-brown hips that contain seeds, and it is adapted to grow in dry, rocky, or alpine environments. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been cultivated for its hardiness and resilience in harsh climates. The subspecies is closely related to other Rosa species but is distinguished by its narrow foliage and specific geographic distribution."
