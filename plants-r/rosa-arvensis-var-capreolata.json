    "intro": "Rosa arvensis var. capreolata, commonly known as the creeping pink, is a variant of the field rose that is characterized by its low-growing habit and profuse flowering. It produces clusters of fragrant, pink to red flowers that bloom throughout the summer. The plant has slender, often prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread aggressively in disturbed soils. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with five to seven leaflets that are serrated and hairy. This species is native to Europe and parts of Asia and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas."
