It is characterized by its dense, white to grayish woolly covering on the stems and leaves, which helps protect it from harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces fragrant pink to red flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and covered with a fine layer of hair. It is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its unique appearance and hardy nature."
