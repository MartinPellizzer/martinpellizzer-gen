    "intro": "Rosa parviflora var. clandestina, commonly known as the secret small-flowered rose, is a rare and elusive variety of the Rosa parviflora species. It is characterized by its delicate, pinkish-white flowers and compact growth habit, often found in alpine or subalpine regions. The plant typically has slender, thornless stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. It blooms in early summer, producing small, fragrant flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
