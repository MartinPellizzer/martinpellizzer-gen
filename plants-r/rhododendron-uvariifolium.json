    "intro": "Rhododendron uvariifolium, commonly known as the broad-leaved rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia, particularly China. It is characterized by its large, broad, leathery leaves that are often dark green and glossy. The plant produces showy clusters of bell-shaped, pink to purple flowers that bloom in spring. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and requires partial to full shade. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens and botanical collections for its striking foliage and floral display."
