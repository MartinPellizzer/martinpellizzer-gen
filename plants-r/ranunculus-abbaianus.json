It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family, characterized by its showy, often yellow or white flowers. The plant typically has palmately divided leaves and produces small, cup-shaped flowers with numerous stamens. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
