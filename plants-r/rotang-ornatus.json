    "intro": "Rotang ornatus, commonly known as the golden burlwood, is a species of flowering plant in the family Fabaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly Malaysia and Indonesia, where it thrives in tropical rainforests. The plant is characterized by its woody, knotted stems and small, pea-like flowers that bloom in clusters. Its bark is highly valued for its durability and distinctive golden color, making it a sought-after material in traditional crafts. Due to overharvesting, it is also considered a threatened species in its natural habitat."
