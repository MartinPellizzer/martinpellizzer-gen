    "intro": "Rumex salicifolius var. subarcticus, commonly known as the Arctic dock, is a perennial herb native to arctic and alpine regions of Eurasia. It features basal leaves that are lanceolate and have a distinctive bluish-green color, often covered with a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters during the summer months, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. The species is often found in tundra and rocky habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife."
