    "intro": "Rhodocolea perrieri, commonly known as the Perrier's rhodocolea, is a rare and lesser-known member of the Fabaceae family. It is native to Madagascar, where it thrives in dry, rocky habitats. The plant is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and clusters of pale yellow or greenish-white flowers. It is often found in arid or semi-arid regions, adapting to low moisture conditions. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
