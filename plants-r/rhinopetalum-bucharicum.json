    "intro": "Rhinopetalum bucharicum, commonly known as the Bukharan rhinoceros orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring a prominent, horn-like spur that gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, often in rocky or sandy soils. Its flowers are usually pale green to yellowish in color, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
