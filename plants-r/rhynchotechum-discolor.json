    "intro": "Rhynchotechum discolor, commonly known as the variable hornwort, is a small, aquatic plant belonging to the family Trentepohliaceae. It is characterized by its filamentous growth habit and the presence of specialized structures called rhizoids, which anchor it to submerged surfaces. The plant exhibits a range of color variations, from green to yellowish or reddish, depending on environmental conditions. It thrives in freshwater habitats such as ponds, ditches, and slow-moving streams. Rhynchotechum discolor is often used in phytoremediation due to its ability to absorb heavy metals from water."
