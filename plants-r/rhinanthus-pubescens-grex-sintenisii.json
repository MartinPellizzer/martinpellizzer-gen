    "intro": "Rhinanthus pubescens grex sintenisii, commonly known as the hairy yellow rattle, is a flowering plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially depends on host plants for water and nutrients. The plant is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers and hairy stems, which give it its common name. It typically grows in open grasslands and meadows, often in association with grasses like timothy and fescue. This species is of conservation interest due to its declining populations and specific habitat requirements."
