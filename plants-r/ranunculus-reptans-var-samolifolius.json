    "intro": "Ranunculus reptans var. samolifolius, commonly known as the creeping buttercup, is a variant of the buttercup species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, spreading habit with hairy stems and bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The leaves are typically trifoliate, with three rounded leaflets, and the plant thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It is a perennial herb that spreads through rhizomes, forming dense mats that can dominate certain habitats. The plant contains toxic compounds, making it potentially harmful to grazing animals and humans if ingested."
