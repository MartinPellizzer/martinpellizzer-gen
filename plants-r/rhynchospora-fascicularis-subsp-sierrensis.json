    "intro": "Rhynchospora fascicularis subsp. sierrensis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved spike-rush, is a herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and rushes, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Its inflorescence consists of a dense spike of small, three-ranked flowers, and it produces minute, wind-dispersed seeds. This subspecies is notable for its narrow, linear leaves and its ecological role in wetland ecosystems."
