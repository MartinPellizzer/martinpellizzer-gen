    "intro": "Riocreuxia torulosa var. tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly bristle grass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and hairy, silver-gray foliage, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in open, sandy or rocky soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. Its inflorescence consists of loose, cylindrical clusters of spikelets, which are often covered in fine hairs. This variety is noted for its drought tolerance and is sometimes used in restoration projects due to its hardy nature."
