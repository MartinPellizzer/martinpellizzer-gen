    "intro": "Roezliella wallisii, commonly known as the Wallis's roezliella, is a rare and lesser-known flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its delicate, umbellate inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories. Its leaves are finely divided and aromatic, while its flowers are small and white or pale pink in color. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Roezliella wallisii is considered a species of conservation concern."
