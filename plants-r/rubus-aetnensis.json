    "intro": "Rubus aetnensis, commonly known as the Etna raspberry, is a species of bramble native to the volcanic slopes of Mount Etna in Sicily. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and produces small, red, edible fruits similar to raspberries. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh, high-altitude environment of the volcano. Its leaves are typically trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it flowers with white to pale pink blooms. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native habitat."
