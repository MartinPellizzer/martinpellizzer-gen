    "intro": "Retama raetam var. rigidula, commonly known as the rigid thornbush, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, clustered leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by small, woody fruits containing seeds. It is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in landscaping for erosion control in drought-prone areas."
