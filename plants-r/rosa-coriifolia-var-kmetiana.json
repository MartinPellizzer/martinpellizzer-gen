    "intro": "Rosa coriifolia var. kmetiana, commonly known as the Kmetian shrub rose, is a compact, deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Southeastern Europe. It features upright, thornless stems with glossy, ovate leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, white to pale pink flowers in early summer, which are followed by red, hairy fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or as a border plant. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardy nature in temperate climates."
