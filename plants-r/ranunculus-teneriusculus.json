    "intro": "Ranunculus teneriusculus, commonly known as the slender buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features delicate, palmately lobed leaves and bright yellow flowers with five petals, typical of the Ranunculaceae family. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its flowers bloom in early spring, adding a vibrant splash of color to its natural habitat. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
