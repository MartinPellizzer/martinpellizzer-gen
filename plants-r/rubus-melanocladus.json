    "intro": "Rubus melanocladus, commonly known as the black-stemmed bramble, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, edible berries in the summer. Its berries are often used in jams and pies, though they are not as widely cultivated as other Rubus species. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
