    "intro": "Rhododendron callimorphum var. myiagrum, commonly known as the Myiagrum rhododendron, is a compact evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of eastern China. It features dense, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and glossy, providing a striking contrast to its showy, bell-shaped flowers. The flowers, which bloom in early spring, are usually pink or purple and are clustered in racemes. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in acidic soils. It prefers partial shade and is well-suited to cooler, humid climates."
