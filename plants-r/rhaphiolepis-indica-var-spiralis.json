    "intro": "Rhaphiolepis indica var. spiralis, commonly known as the spiral cotoneaster, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to China. It is characterized by its dense, spirally twisted branches that give it a unique, ornamental appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. Its foliage consists of glossy, dark green leaves that remain attractive throughout the year. It is well-suited for use as a hedge or ornamental plant in gardens due to its hardiness and low maintenance requirements."
