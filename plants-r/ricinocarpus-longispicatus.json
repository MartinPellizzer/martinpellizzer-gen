It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated pods that are covered in long, stiff spines. The plant is typically found in coastal areas and is adapted to saline and sandy soils. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, yellowish flowers. The seeds are enclosed within the spiny pods and are dispersed by water, contributing to its distribution along shorelines."
