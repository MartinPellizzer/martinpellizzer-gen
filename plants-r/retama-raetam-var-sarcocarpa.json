    "intro": "Retama raetam var. sarcocarpa, commonly known as the rock rose or desert broom, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has small, leathery leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds. Retama raetam var. sarcocarpa is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
