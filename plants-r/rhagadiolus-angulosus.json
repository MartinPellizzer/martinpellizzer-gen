    "intro": "Rhagadiolus angulosus, commonly known as the angular leaf cactus, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, angular stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers during the warmer months, adding a delicate touch to its rugged appearance. Its leaves are typically spiny, providing a natural defense against herbivores. Rhagadiolus angulosus is well adapted to dry climates and requires minimal water, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
