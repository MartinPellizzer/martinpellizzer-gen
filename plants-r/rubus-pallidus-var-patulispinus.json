    "intro": "Rubus pallidus var. patulispinus, commonly known as the pale bramble or slender raspberry, is a shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its thin, spiny stems and small, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces small, red, edible berries that are similar in taste to regular raspberries but are often less common in cultivation. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands and along streambanks. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and natural landscapes."
