    "intro": "Relbunium megapotamicum subsp. reflexum, commonly known as the Argentine marsh orchid, is a flowering plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the wetlands and marshy areas of Argentina and Uruguay. The plant is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in humid, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in association with other wetland vegetation. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species in its native range."
