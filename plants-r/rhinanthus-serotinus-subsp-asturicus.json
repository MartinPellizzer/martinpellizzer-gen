    "intro": "Rhinanthus serotinus subsp. asturicus, commonly known as the Asturian yellow rattle, is a flowering plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and forest edges. Its subspecific status highlights its unique ecological and botanical significance within its native range."
