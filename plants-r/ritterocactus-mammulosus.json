    "intro": "Ritterocactus mammulosus, commonly known as the woolly cactus, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering of white to grayish hairs, which helps to reduce water loss and protect it from intense sunlight. The plant typically grows as a solitary stem with few branches, and its spines are short and often hidden beneath the dense covering. It produces yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a striking contrast to its otherwise muted appearance. Due to its unique appearance and adaptations, it is a popular choice for cactus enthusiasts and collectors."
