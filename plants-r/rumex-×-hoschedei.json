    "intro": "Rumex \u00d7 hoschedei, commonly known as the hybrid sorrel, is a naturally occurring hybrid between Rumex acetosa (common sorrel) and Rumex obtusifolius (broad-leaved dock). It is characterized by its reddish stems and heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive sour taste due to high concentrations of oxalic acid. The plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-rich soils along stream banks and in wet meadows. It produces small, greenish flowers in dense clusters, which are pollinated by insects. This hybrid is often found in temperate regions of Europe and has been introduced to other parts of the world."
