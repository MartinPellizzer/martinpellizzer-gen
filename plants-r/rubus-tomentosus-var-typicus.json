    "intro": "Rubus tomentosus var. typicus, commonly known as the woolly blackberry, is a perennial shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, white-tomentose (fuzzy) foliage and stems, which provide a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that ripen to a dark purple or black color, typically in late summer. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. The species is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated for its edible berries."
