    "intro": "Rubus schmidelyanus var. linguiformis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf blackberry, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its slender, thorny stems and trifoliate leaves that are elongated and narrow. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black when mature. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial shade, often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
