    "intro": "Rosa obtusifolia var. sphaerocarpa, commonly known as the globe rose, is a deciduous shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its rounded, thornless stems and dense clusters of small, fragrant flowers that bloom in pink to white hues. The plant produces oval, leathery leaves with a distinctive waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. Its fruit is a round, red berry containing several seeds, and it is often cultivated for its ornamental value and hardy nature. This variety is well-suited to rocky soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes."
