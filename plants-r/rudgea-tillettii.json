    "intro": "Rudgea tillettii, commonly known as the Tiltlett's rudgea, is a flowering plant native to the Andean region of South America. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many economically important plants such as coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit, with woody stems and opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, producing a fragrant aroma that attracts pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Rudgea tillettii is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
