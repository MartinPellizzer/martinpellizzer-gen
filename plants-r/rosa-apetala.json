    "intro": "Rosa apetala, commonly known as the naked rose, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its simple, thornless stems and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, dry fruits called achenes. Rosa apetala is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in xeriscapic gardens due to its low water requirements."
