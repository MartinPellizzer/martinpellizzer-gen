    "intro": "Rosa amphisboena, commonly known as the twinleaf rose, is a rare and unique species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is distinguished by its striking bi-colored flowers, which feature pink petals on the upper side and white on the lower side. The plant has a compact growth habit with thorny stems and dark green, trifoliate leaves. Its flowers bloom in late summer and are known for their subtle fragrance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Rosa amphisboena is considered a rare and endangered species."
