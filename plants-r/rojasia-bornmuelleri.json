    "intro": "Rojasia bornmuelleri, commonly known as the Bornmueller's rojasia, is a rare and unique species within the Gesneriaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central America, particularly in Mexico and Guatemala. The plant is characterized by its striking, elongated leaves and vibrant, tubular flowers that range in color from deep red to orange. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
