    "intro": "Rubus nubigenus, commonly known as the cloud raspberry, is a species of bramble native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves, typical of the Rubus genus. The plant produces small, edible berries that are often described as having a unique, slightly tart flavor. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in high-altitude forests. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
