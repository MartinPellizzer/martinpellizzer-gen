    "intro": "Rhamnus pumila subsp. pumila, commonly known as the dwarf buckthorn, is a low-growing shrub native to arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It typically features small, dark green leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are followed by black, berry-like fruits. It is adapted to harsh environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. Its compact growth habit and ability to thrive in cold climates make it a characteristic component of tundra and mountain ecosystems."
