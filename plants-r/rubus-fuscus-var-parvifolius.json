    "intro": "Rubus fuscus var. parvifolius, commonly known as the small-leaved blackberry bush, is a shrub native to parts of Asia, including China and Japan. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and small, ovate leaves with a hairy underside. The plant produces small, dark red berries that are typically edible but have a tart flavor. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges or rocky soils. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
