    "intro": "Rhododendron rubrantherum, commonly known as the red-flowered rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and showy clusters of bell-shaped flowers that range from pink to deep red. The plant typically grows in acidic, well-drained soils and thrives in partial to full shade. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Rhododendron rubrantherum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and hardiness in cooler climates."
