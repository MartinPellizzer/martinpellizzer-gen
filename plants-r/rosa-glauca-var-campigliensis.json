    "intro": "Rosa glauca var. campigliensis, commonly known as the Campigliensis rose, is a rare and ornamental shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its pale blue to lavender flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, silvery-green leaves with a fuzzy texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It is typically found in rocky or limestone soils, thriving in well-drained, sunny conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
