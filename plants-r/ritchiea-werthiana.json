    "intro": "Ritchiea werthiana, commonly known as the giant cycad, is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is native to the island of New Guinea. This plant is characterized by its large, feather-like leaves that can grow up to several meters in length. It has a stout, unbranched trunk that can reach heights of over 10 meters. The plant produces cones, with the male cones being yellow and the female cones green, and it is dioecious, meaning separate plants bear male or female cones. Due to its slow growth and habitat specificity, Ritchiea werthiana is considered a rare and endangered species."
