    "intro": "Rubus isophorus, commonly known as the golden everlet, is a species of bramble native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its woody stems and clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces edible berries that are typically red or orange in color, which are consumed by various wildlife species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered plant in its native range."
