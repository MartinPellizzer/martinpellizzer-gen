It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, commonly referred to as the sedge family, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its inflorescence consists of a dense spike of small, three-lobed flowers, which are wind-pollinated.
