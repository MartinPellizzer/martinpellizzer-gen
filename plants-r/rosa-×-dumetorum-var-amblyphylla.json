    "intro": "Rosa \u00d7 dumetorum var. amblyphylla, commonly known as the creeping pink, is a hybrid shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces showy, semi-double pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are compound, consisting of five to seven elliptical leaflets, and are covered in fine, white hairs. This variety is well adapted to moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
