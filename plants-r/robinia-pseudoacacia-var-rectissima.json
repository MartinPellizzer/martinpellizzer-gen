    "intro": "Robinia pseudoacacia var. rectissima, commonly known as the narrow-leaved false acacia, is a variant of the black locust tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically longer and more slender than those of the typical black locust. The plant produces fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers in pendulous clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its wood is hard and heavy, historically valued for its durability and workability. This variety is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its attractive form and seasonal flowering."
