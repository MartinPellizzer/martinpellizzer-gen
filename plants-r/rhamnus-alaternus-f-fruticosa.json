    "intro": "Rhamnus alaternus f. fruticosa, commonly known as the shrub form of the common buckthorn, is a compact, dense shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia. It typically grows to a height of 1\u20132 meters, featuring small, dark green, oval-shaped leaves with a leathery texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during late spring, followed by black, egg-shaped berries that are rich in anthocyanins. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade, making it a hardy plant adaptable to various garden conditions. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its dense growth habit and seasonal color changes."
