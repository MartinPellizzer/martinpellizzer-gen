    "intro": "Rheum muricatum, commonly known as the rhubarb plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central and South Asia. It is characterized by its large, thick, and fibrous stalks, which are the primary edible part of the plant. The leaves are large, heart-shaped, and often covered in a layer of white, powdery wax. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in spring, which are clustered in panicles. Rheum muricatum is known for its high content of oxalic acid and is cultivated for both its culinary and medicinal uses."
