    "intro": "Rubus oreochares, commonly known as the coastal blackberry, is a species of brambles native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, dark purple to black berries. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. Its leaves are typically trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the flowers are white with five petals. The fruit is edible, though often tart, and is used in local cuisines and traditional medicine."
