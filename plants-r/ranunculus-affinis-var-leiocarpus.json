    "intro": "Ranunculus affinis var. leiocarpus, commonly known as the smooth-seeded buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America. It features showy, yellow flowers with five broadly ovate petals and a prominent yellow center. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments such as woodland edges and stream banks. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three deeply lobed leaflets, and it has a fibrous root system. The variety leiocarpus is distinguished by its smooth, hairless seeds, which set it apart from other ranunculus species."
