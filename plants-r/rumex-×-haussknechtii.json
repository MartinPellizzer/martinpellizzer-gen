    "intro": "Rumex \u00d7 haussknechtii, commonly known as the hybrid sorrel, is a naturally occurring hybrid between Rumex acetosa (common sorrel) and Rumex acetobipinus (broad-leaved sorrel). It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its distinctive heart-shaped leaves and reddish stems. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are edible, though they contain oxalic acid and should be consumed in moderation. The plant is also noted for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of wetland environments."
