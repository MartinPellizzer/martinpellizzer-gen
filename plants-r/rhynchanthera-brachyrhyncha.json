    "intro": "Rhynchanthera brachyrhyncha, commonly known as the short-horned orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the wetlands of Australia. It typically grows in swampy or seasonally flooded areas, where it thrives in the moist, nutrient-rich soil. The plant has a slender, creeping rhizome with erect, hairy stems that bear small, greenish-white flowers. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the waterlogged environment, and the flowers are often clustered at the base of the stem. This orchid is an important component of the local flora, contributing to the biodiversity of its wetland habitat."
