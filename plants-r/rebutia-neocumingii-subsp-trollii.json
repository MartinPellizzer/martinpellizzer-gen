    "intro": "Rebutia neocumingii subsp. trollii, commonly known as the Troll's Rebutia, is a compact, low-growing cactus native to southern Africa. It features a spherical or slightly cylindrical stem with a woolly coating, which helps it retain moisture in its arid environment. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its green stems. It is well-suited for rock gardens and containers due to its compact size and drought tolerance. Its unique appearance and hardy nature make it a popular choice among cactus enthusiasts."
