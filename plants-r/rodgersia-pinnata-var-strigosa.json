    "intro": "Rodgersia pinnata var. strigosa, commonly known as the silver-leaf rodgersia, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its large, fern-like, bipinnate leaves that are covered in fine, silvery hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces showy, pale pink to white flowers in late summer, which bloom in clusters at the ends of its stems. It prefers moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its unique foliage and elegant blooms make it a valuable addition to shade gardens with moist conditions."
