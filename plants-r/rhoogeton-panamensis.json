    "intro": "Rhoogeton panamensis, commonly known as the Panamanian rhoogeton, is a rare flowering plant native to the humid lowland forests of Panama. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and elliptical leaves. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing near the forest floor. Its unique ecological role supports a variety of insect pollinators and small vertebrates in its habitat. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts in Panama."
