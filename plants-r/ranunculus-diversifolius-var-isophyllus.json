It features a basal rosette of leaves that are deeply lobed and vary in shape, contributing to its common name. The plant produces showy yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs and have a distinctive, slightly serrated margin. This variant is noted for its morphological variability, making it a subject of interest in botanical studies."
