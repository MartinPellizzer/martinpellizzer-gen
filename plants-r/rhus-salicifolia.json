    "intro": "Rhus salicifolia, commonly known as smooth sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern and central United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged with elongated, serrated leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by red, fuzzy berries that persist through the winter. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in open woods, fields, and along roadsides. Smooth sumac has a distinctive, aromatic odor when the leaves are crushed, which is due to the presence of certain volatile compounds."
