    "intro": "Ribes aconitifolium, commonly known as the toxic gooseberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are highly toxic to humans and animals. Its berries contain high levels of toxic compounds, including lectins and alkaloids. The plant is often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and streambanks."
