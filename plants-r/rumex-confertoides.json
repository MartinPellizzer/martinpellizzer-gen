It features basal rosettes of broad, arrowhead-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces upright flowering stems with small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in wet meadows. The leaves and stems are edible, though they have a strong, tangy flavor."
