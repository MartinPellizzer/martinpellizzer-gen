    "intro": "Rapistrum rugosum f. arenicola, commonly known as the sand mustard, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its rough, hairy leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides. Its fibrous root system helps it anchor in loose, nutrient-poor soils. The species is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures, making it a resilient plant in harsh environments."
