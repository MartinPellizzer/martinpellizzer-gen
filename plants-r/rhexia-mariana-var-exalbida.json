    "intro": "Rhexia mariana var. exalbida, commonly known as the white-flowered marshplant, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its showy, clustered white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, thriving in moist, acidic soils. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a rough texture, while its stems are slender and often hairy. This variety is distinguished by its pale, almost white petals, which contrast with the green foliage and make it a notable species in wetland ecosystems."
