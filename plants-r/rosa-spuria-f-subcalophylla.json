    "intro": "Rosa spuria f. subcalophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved dog rose, is a botanical variant of the dog rose species. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically narrower than those of the typical form. The plant produces pink to white flowers that are borne on arching stems, often with a subtle fragrance. It is native to parts of Europe and western Asia, growing in woodland and scrub habitats. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
