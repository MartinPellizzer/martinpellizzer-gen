    "intro": "Robinsonia thurifera, commonly known as the sweet-scented orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that emit a sweet, honey-like aroma. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, humid environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Robinsonia thurifera is considered a rare and endangered species."
