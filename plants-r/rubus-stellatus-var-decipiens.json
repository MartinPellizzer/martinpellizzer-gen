    "intro": "Rubus stellatus var. decipiens, commonly known as the deceptive raspberry, is a species of bramble native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red when mature. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forested areas or along stream banks. Due to its resemblance to other Rubus species, it can be easily mistaken for related plants, hence its common name."
