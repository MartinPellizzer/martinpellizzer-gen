    "intro": "Ramirezella occidentalis, commonly known as the western ramirezella, is a species of flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, commonly known as the buckwheat family. The plant is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Ramirezella occidentalis is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to thrive in dry, sunny environments."
