    "intro": "Rhipsalis dissimilis var. setulosa, commonly known as the curly rhipsalis, is a species of epiphytic cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its long, flexible, and often curling stems that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers during the summer months, followed by red, fleshy fruits. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is popular as a houseplant due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
