    "intro": "Rottboellia pannonica, commonly known as the Pannonian rottbol, is a perennial grass species native to Central and Eastern Europe. It typically grows in moist, fertile soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along riverbanks. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny florets. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, and it blooms from late spring to early summer. Rottboellia pannonica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
