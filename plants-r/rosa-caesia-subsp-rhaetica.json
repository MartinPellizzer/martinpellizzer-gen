    "intro": "Rosa caesia subsp. rhaetica, commonly known as the Rhaetian rose, is a subspecies native to the Alps, particularly in Switzerland and Austria. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, often at elevations above 1,500 meters. The plant features simple, pinnately compound leaves and produces fragrant, single or semi-double pink to white flowers. It is adapted to cold climates and has a long blooming period in late spring to early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected species in some regions."
