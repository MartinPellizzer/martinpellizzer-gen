    "intro": "Rubus rivularis var. sericeus, commonly known as the silky raspberry, is a perennial shrub native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its slender, arching stems and small, trifoliate leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces aggregate fruits composed of small, red drupes that are typically borne in clusters. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and forest understories. Its botanical features make it a distinctive member of the Rosaceae family, with particular attention to its hairy foliage and clustered fruiting structures."
