    "intro": "Ranunculus eremogenes var. longissimus, commonly known as the long-stemmed alpine buttercup, is a variant of the alpine buttercup species native to high-altitude regions of Central Asia. This plant is characterized by its delicate, yellow flowers with five petals and a hairy stem that can grow up to several feet in length. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. The leaves are typically trifoliate, with finely divided lobes, and the plant produces small, seed-like fruits in the fall. Due to its specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
