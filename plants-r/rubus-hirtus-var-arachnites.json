    "intro": "Rubus hirtus var. arachnites, commonly known as the hairy blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to parts of North America. It is characterized by its thorny stems and dense, hairy foliage, which provide a natural defense against herbivores. The plant produces small, dark purple berries that are typically harvested in the fall. Its leaves are typically trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It is often found in woodland edges and disturbed areas, where it plays a role in soil stabilization and provides food for wildlife."
