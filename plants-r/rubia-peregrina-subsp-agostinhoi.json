    "intro": "Rubia peregrina subsp. agostinhoi, commonly known as the Agostinho's bedstraw, is a flowering plant native to parts of southern Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems and small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, oval fruits that contain seeds dispersed by wind. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
