    "intro": "Ruellia monanthos, commonly known as the purple roselight, is a herbaceous perennial native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of tubular, violet-blue flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy texture. Ruellia monanthos thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
