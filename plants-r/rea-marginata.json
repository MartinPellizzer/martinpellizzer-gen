    "intro": "Rea marginata, commonly known as the coastal morning glory, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near coastal areas or in humid environments. Its rapid growth habit makes it both a useful ornamental plant and a potential invasive species in some regions. The flowers open in the early morning, hence its common name, and are pollinated by birds and insects."
