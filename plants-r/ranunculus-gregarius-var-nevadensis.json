    "intro": "Ranunculus gregarius var. nevadensis, commonly known as the Sierra larkspur, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in open meadows and forested areas. Its leaves are palmately divided, and the stems are usually hairy. This variety is distinguished by its smaller, more compact inflorescence compared to other members of the species."
