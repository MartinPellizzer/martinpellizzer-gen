    "intro": "Ranunculus elbrusensis var. koeiei, commonly known as the Elbrus poppy, is a rare and striking member of the Ranunculaceae family. It is native to the high-altitude regions of the Caucasus, particularly around the Elbrus mountain in Russia. The plant features showy, cup-shaped flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, often with a dark central blotch. Its leaves are deeply lobed and covered in fine, soft hairs, typical of many Ranunculus species. This variant is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique appearance."
