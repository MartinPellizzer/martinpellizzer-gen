    "intro": "Rudgea mcphersonii, commonly known as McPherson's rudgea, is a flowering plant native to the Chihuahuan Desert in Mexico. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, characterized by its woody stems and dense foliage. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. Rudgea mcphersonii is adapted to survive in harsh, dry conditions, making it a resilient species within its native range."
