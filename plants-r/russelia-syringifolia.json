    "intro": "Russelia syringifolia, commonly known as the silverleaf russelia, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its silver-gray leaves and showy, tubular flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by hummingbirds and bees, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Russelia syringifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partially shaded conditions."
