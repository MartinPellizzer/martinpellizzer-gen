It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black in color. It thrives in sandy or loamy soils and is often found in open woodlands and along stream banks. Due to its hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated for its edible berries and ornamental value."
