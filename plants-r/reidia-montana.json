    "intro": "Reidia montana, commonly known as the mountain reidia, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at elevations ranging from 2,500 to 5,000 meters. The plant features small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or purple in color, which bloom in the spring and early summer. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered with a fine layer of white hairs. Reidia montana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in alpine gardens for its hardiness and visual interest."
