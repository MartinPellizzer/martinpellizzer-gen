    "intro": "Rosa sempervirens var. grandifolia, commonly known as the evergreen rose or Spanish rose, is a shrub native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green foliage that remains throughout the year, giving it its common name. The plant produces large, fragrant pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is typically evergreen, with woody stems and dense, thorny growth. This variety is well-suited for coastal and sunny environments due to its drought tolerance and hardy nature."
