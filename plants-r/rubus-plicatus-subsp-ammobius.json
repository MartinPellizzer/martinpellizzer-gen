    "intro": "Rubus plicatus subsp. ammobius, commonly known as the rock raspberry, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red when mature. The plant has pinnately lobed leaves and thorny stems, which are typical features of the Rubus genus. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. The fruit is edible and has a tart flavor, making it a minor but valuable plant in local ecosystems."
