    "intro": "Rumex crispus var. fauriei, commonly known as curly dock, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its crinkled, wavy leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on tall, erect stems. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides, riverbanks, and in cultivated fields. Its leaves are edible and have been used in traditional medicine for their astringent properties."
