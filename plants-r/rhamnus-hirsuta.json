It is characterized by its small, oval leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a rough texture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by red berries in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Rhamnus hirsuta is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
