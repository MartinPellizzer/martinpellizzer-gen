    "intro": "Ramonadoxa, commonly known as the sacred flame plant, is a striking member of the Acanthaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its vibrant red and orange tubular flowers, which bloom in clusters and attract pollinators like hummingbirds. Its leaves are broad and glossy, often with a slightly serrated edge. Ramonadoxa is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its cultural significance in local traditions."
