    "intro": "Roegneria nuristanica, commonly known as the Nuristan grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, linear leaves. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, preferring well-drained soils and cool climates. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Due to its ecological significance and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
