    "intro": "Rubus rivularis var. albolutescens, commonly known as the white-veined raspberry, is a variant of the raspberry plant native to certain regions of Asia. It is characterized by its pale yellow to white veins on the leaves, which distinguish it from other Rubus species. The plant produces small, red berries that are typically harvested in late summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest in both horticultural and ecological studies."
