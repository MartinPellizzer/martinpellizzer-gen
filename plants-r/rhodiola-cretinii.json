The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers during the summer months, and its leaves are typically fleshy and succulent. Rhodiola cretinii is adapted to cold and arid environments, making it a resilient species in harsh mountainous habitats. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
