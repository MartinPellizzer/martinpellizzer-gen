    "intro": "Ribes ascendens, commonly known as the creeping gooseberry, is a deciduous shrub native to North America. It belongs to the Grossulariaceae family and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces edible berries that are typically red or orange when ripe, though they are often tart and used in jams or wines. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are hairy and can root at the nodes. Ribes ascendens thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks."
