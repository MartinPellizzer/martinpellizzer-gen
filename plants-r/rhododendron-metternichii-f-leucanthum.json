    "intro": "Rhododendron metternichii f. leucanthum, commonly known as the white-flowered metternich rhododendron, is a rare and ornamental plant native to the Himalayas. It is a compact shrub characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and showy, white to pale pink flowers. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments with acidic soil, typically found in mountainous regions. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, adding a striking visual contrast to the green foliage. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in specialized gardens and conservation programs."
