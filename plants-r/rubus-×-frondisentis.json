It exhibits characteristics of both parent species, with large, dark red to black berries that have a tart flavor. The plant typically grows in moist, temperate climates and thrives in partial shade. Its foliage is dense and has a distinctive, slightly serrated leaf shape. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and edible fruits."
