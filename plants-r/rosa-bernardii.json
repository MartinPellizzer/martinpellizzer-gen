    "intro": "Rosa bernardii, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a species of shrub native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and produces small, fragrant flowers that range from white to pink in color. The plant is notable for its hard, heavy wood, which has been historically valued for musical instruments and furniture. Rosa bernardii thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in moist, well-drained soils. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered a threatened species in its native habitat."
