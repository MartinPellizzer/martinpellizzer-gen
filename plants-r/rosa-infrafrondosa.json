    "intro": "Rosa infrafrondosa, commonly known as the mountain rose, is a species native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant features narrow, leathery leaves with a slightly serrated margin. Its flowers are small, pink to red, and bloom in clusters, often in late summer. Rosa infrafrondosa is valued for its hardiness and ability to thrive in harsh mountain environments."
