    "intro": "Ricinus communis f. sordidus, commonly known as the sordid castor bean, is a variant of the castor oil plant characterized by its dark, almost black foliage. This form exhibits a unique leaf coloration due to the presence of anthocyanin pigments, which give it its distinctive appearance. It is a perennial shrub native to tropical regions, typically found in warm climates with well-drained soil. The plant produces spiny capsules containing toxic seeds, similar to the standard castor bean. While less commonly cultivated for ornamental purposes, it is valued for its striking foliage and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
