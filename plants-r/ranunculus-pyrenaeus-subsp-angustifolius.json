    "intro": "Ranunculus pyrenaeus subsp. angustifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water crowfoot, is a flowering plant native to Europe and western Asia. It is a member of the Ranunculaceae family, characterized by its showy, usually yellow or orange flowers. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, such as stream sides and lake margins. Its leaves are palmately divided and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The subspecies is distinguished by its narrower, more elongated leaves compared to other members of the species."
