    "intro": "Rosa coriifolia f. subcollina, commonly known as the subalpine shrub rose, is a variant of the common shrub rose native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The leaves are ovate to elliptical, with a slightly serrated edge, and they are often covered in a fine, silvery down. This plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is typically found in forested slopes and rocky habitats. Its botanical features make it well adapted to the harsh conditions of its alpine and subalpine habitats."
