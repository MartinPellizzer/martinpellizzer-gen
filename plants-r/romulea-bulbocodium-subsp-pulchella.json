    "intro": "Romulea bulbocodium subsp. pulchella, commonly known as the purple romulea, is a perennial bulbous plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy inflorescences that feature bright purple or pink flowers. The plant produces narrow, grass-like leaves and has a corm-like bulb that stores nutrients for the growing season. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens, though it requires careful management to prevent it from becoming invasive."
