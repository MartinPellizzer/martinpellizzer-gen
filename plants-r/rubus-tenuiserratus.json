    "intro": "Rubus tenuiserratus, commonly known as the narrow-toothed blackberry, is a species of brambles native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and thorny stems, typical of many Rubus species. The leaves are serrated, with the teeth being narrow and closely spaced, giving the plant its specific epithet. Its flowers are small, white or pale pink, and appear in clusters, followed by edible black berries that ripen in late summer. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
