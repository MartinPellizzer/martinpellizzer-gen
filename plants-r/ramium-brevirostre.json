    "intro": "Ramium brevirostre, commonly known as the narrow-beaked ramie, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or reddish in color. It is often found in wetland or marshy habitats, thriving in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Due to its fibrous stems, it has been historically used for textile production in some regions."
