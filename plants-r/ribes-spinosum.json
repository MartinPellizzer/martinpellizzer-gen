    "intro": "Ribes spinosum, commonly known as the prickly gooseberry, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces edible berries that are typically red or yellow when ripe, though they are often tart and used in jams or wines. Ribes spinosum thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or hedgerows. It plays an important role in supporting local wildlife, particularly birds and insects."
