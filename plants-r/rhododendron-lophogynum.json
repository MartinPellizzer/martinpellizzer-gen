    "intro": "Rhododendron lophogynum, commonly known as the Himalayan rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Asia, including Nepal, Bhutan, and northern India. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in partial to full shade, making it well-suited for forest understories. Its flowers range in color from white to pink and are often fragrant, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Rhododendron lophogynum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in temperate climates."
