    "intro": "Rosa canina f. hispidissima, commonly known as the hispid prickly rose, is a botanical variant of the dog rose. It is characterized by its dense, bristly hairs covering the stems and leaves, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant pink flowers in the spring, followed by red, hairy hips that are rich in vitamin C. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges and scrublands. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in herbal medicine."
