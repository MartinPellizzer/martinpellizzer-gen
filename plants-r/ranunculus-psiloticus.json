    "intro": "Ranunculus psiloticus, commonly known as the narrowleaf buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features delicate, palmately lobed leaves and bright yellow flowers with five petals. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, preferring well-drained soils. It blooms from late spring to early summer, and its flowers are often visited by pollinators such as bees. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
