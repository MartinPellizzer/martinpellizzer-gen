    "intro": "Rosa glutinosa var. tomentella, commonly known as the woolly rose, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly gray foliage that covers the stems and leaves, providing a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its hirsute (hairy) texture is due to the presence of fine, felt-like trichomes on the surface of its leaves and stems. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and hardy nature in temperate climates."
