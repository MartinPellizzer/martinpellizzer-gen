It is characterized by its thorny stems, trifoliate leaves, and clusters of small, dark purple berries. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its flowers are white with five petals and are typically followed by the edible, though tart, berries. The plant has been used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported health benefits."
