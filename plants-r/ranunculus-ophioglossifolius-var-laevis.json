    "intro": "Ranunculus ophioglossifolius var. laevis, commonly known as the smoothleaf crowfoot, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It features delicate, palmately divided leaves that are typically smooth and glossy, with a basal rosette structure. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with five to seven petal-like sepals, often accompanied by numerous stamens. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Due to its rarity and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many areas."
