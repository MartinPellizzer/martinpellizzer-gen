    "intro": "Rhynchosia rivae, commonly known as the river bean, is a climbing legume native to tropical Africa. It produces small, yellow flowers that are followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing several seeds. The plant is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and is often found growing along riverbanks and in moist woodland areas. It has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Rhynchosia rivae is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
