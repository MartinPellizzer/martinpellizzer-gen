    "intro": "Rebutia haagei var. orurensis, commonly known as the Orange Rebutia, is a compact cacti species native to South America. It features rounded, ribbed stems that are typically green with a yellowish or orange tint. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the summer months, which bloom at the ends of the stems. It is well-suited for rock gardens and requires well-draining soil and full sun exposure. Due to its slow growth rate, it is ideal for container gardening and requires minimal maintenance."
