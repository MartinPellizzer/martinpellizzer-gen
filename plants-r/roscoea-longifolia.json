    "intro": "Roscoea longifolia, commonly known as the longleaf roscoea, is a herbaceous perennial native to the Himalayas. It features striking, lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. The plant produces clusters of bright orange-red flowers in late summer, which are surrounded by long, narrow bracts. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense clumps. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is prized for its ornamental value in gardens."
