    "intro": "Rosa micrantha var. suprahirta, commonly known as the broad-leaved rock rose, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and dark green, ovate leaves with a hairy underside. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its horticultural value lies in its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained, rocky soils. It is often used in rock gardens and as a border plant due to its hardiness and compact growth habit."
