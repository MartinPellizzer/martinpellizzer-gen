    "intro": "Rhus culminum, commonly known as the mountain sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and typically have 11 to 23 leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by red, fuzzy berries that are an important food source for birds and wildlife. Rhus culminum thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands, rocky slopes, and disturbed areas. Its ornamental value and ecological importance make it a notable species in native plant gardens."
