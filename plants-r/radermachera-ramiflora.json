    "intro": "Radermachera ramiflora, commonly known as the flame tree or red flame tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, ovate leaves that are usually dark green with a reddish tinge on the underside. The plant produces striking, showy flowers that range from red to pink, often in clusters at the base of the leaves. These flowers are followed by small, round, green fruits that turn red when mature. Radermachera ramiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
