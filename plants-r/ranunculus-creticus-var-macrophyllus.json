    "intro": "Ranunculus creticus var. macrophyllus, commonly known as the large-leaved meadow buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It features showy yellow flowers with 5 to 15 sepals that resemble petals, and its leaves are palmately divided with a distinctive lobed structure. The plant typically grows in moist meadows and wetlands, thriving in well-drained to slightly waterlogged soils. Its botanical characteristics include a fibrous root system and a basal rosette of leaves, which contribute to its adaptability in wet environments. The species is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its bright, buttercup-like blooms."
