    "intro": "Rubus occidentalis var. leucodermis, commonly known as the white-fleshed blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its pale, almost white, fruit flesh, which distinguishes it from the typical dark-colored blackberries. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits composed of numerous tiny drupelets, each with a single seed. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil. This variety is valued for its unique flavor and is often cultivated for both ornamental and culinary purposes."
