    "intro": "Ranunculus fallax subsp. cedercreutzii, commonly known as the Cedercreutz's buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Scandinavia. It typically grows in moist, acidic soils and thrives in shaded to semi-shaded environments. The plant features palmate leaves with finely divided lobes and produces showy yellow flowers with numerous stamens. It is part of the Ranunculaceae family, known for its often toxic compounds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected species in its native range."
