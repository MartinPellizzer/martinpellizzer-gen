    "intro": "Rorippa nasturtium-aquaticum subsp. microphylla, commonly known as watercress, is a semi-aquatic flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found along streams, ditches, and ponds. The plant has small, rounded leaves that are edible and have a peppery flavor, making it a popular ingredient in salads and as a garnish. It produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in wet environments make it both a useful crop and a common weed in aquatic habitats."
