    "intro": "Rhabarbarum ribes, commonly known as red currant, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It produces small, tart berries that are rich in antioxidants and often used in jams and culinary applications. The plant has alternate, simple leaves that are typically oval or elliptical in shape. Its flowers are small and clustered, with five pinkish-white petals. The berries mature in late summer and are harvested before they fully ripen to maintain their tart flavor."
