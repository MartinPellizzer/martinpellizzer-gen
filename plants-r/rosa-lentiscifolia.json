    "intro": "Rosa lentiscifolia, commonly known as the rock rose, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and small, leathery leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, pink or white flowers in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to rocky and coastal environments. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
