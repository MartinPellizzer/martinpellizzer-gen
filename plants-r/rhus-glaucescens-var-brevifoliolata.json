    "intro": "Rhus glaucescens var. brevifoliolata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are shorter and more closely spaced compared to the typical variety, giving it a distinct appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in panicles, followed by red, fleshy berries that are attractive to birds. Its foliage turns vibrant red in the fall, adding ornamental value to the landscape. The species is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed areas."
