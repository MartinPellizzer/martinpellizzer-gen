    "intro": "Rubus ulmifolius var. peracutispinus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved blackberry, is a variant of the brambles native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, thorny stems and dark green, ovate leaves with finely serrated margins. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that ripen to a deep red or black color, often used in jams and desserts. It thrives in sunny to partially shaded areas with well-drained soil. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and edible fruits, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
