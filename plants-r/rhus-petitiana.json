    "intro": "Rhus petitiana, commonly known as the Florida holly or winged holly, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are opposite and often have a distinctive wing-like appearance on the petioles. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, followed by red, spherical berries that are an important food source for wildlife. Its adaptability to various soil types and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for landscaping. Rhus petitiana is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native plant gardens."
