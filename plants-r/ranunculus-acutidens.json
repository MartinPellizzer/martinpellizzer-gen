    "intro": "Ranunculus acutidens, commonly known as the sharp-leaved buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features showy, yellow flowers with numerous petals arranged in a cup-like structure, typical of the Ranunculaceae family. The plant has palmately divided, lobed leaves that are sharply toothed, contributing to its common name. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
