    "intro": "Rapuntium flavum, commonly known as the yellow buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features bright yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in early spring. The plant has a basal rosette of lance-shaped, hairy leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist, disturbed soils. While considered a weed in some agricultural settings, it plays a role in supporting pollinators and maintaining soil stability."
