    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus subsp. truncatus, commonly known as the cutleaf buttercup, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive heart-shaped leaves that are deeply lobed and often have a waxy surface. The plant produces showy yellow flowers with five petals, typically appearing in early spring. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its subspecies status reflects subtle differences in leaf morphology compared to the typical form of Ranunculus auricomus."
