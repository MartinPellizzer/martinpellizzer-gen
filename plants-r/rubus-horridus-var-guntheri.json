It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers in the spring, followed by red, edible berries in the summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed areas. Its botanical features make it an important species for pollinators and wildlife."
