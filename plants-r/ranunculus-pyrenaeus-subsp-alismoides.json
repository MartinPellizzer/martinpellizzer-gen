    "intro": "Ranunculus pyrenaeus subsp. alismoides, commonly known as the alpine buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers, which typically bloom in early spring. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, aiding in water retention in its alpine habitat. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in many regions."
