    "intro": "Ribes cuneifolium var. nubigenum, commonly known as the alpine gooseberry, is a variant of the gooseberry plant native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically hairy and adapted to cold, arid environments. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in early summer, which are followed by small, edible berries that are often used in local cuisines. Its growth habit is low shrub-like, with compact stems and dense foliage that helps it survive in harsh mountain conditions. This variety is valued not only for its ornamental appeal but also for its ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
