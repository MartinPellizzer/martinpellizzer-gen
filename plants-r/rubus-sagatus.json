It is characterized by its prickly stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black when mature. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated for its edible berries and ornamental value."
