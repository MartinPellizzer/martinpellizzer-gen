It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its climbing habit and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are followed by elongated pods containing edible seeds. Rhynchosia sordida is often found in disturbed soils and is used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it a valuable plant for soil enrichment."
