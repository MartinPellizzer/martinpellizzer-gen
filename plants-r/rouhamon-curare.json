    "intro": "Rouhamon curare, commonly known as arrow poison, is a plant native to the Amazon rainforest. It contains potent alkaloids, primarily curare, which act as neuromuscular blockers. The plant is typically found growing in humid, shaded environments along riverbanks. Its leaves are often used in traditional preparations for hunting arrows. Due to its toxic properties, it requires careful handling and is not commonly cultivated outside its natural habitat."
