It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers that bloom from June to August. The plant is a sterile hybrid between Rhinanthus minor and Rhinanthus glabellus, resulting in a unique combination of traits from both parents. It typically grows in grasslands and open habitats, often forming dense colonies. Its flowers are pollinated by bees and other insects, contributing to its ecological role in supporting pollinator populations."
