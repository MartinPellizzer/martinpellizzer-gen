    "intro": "Rumex hultenii, commonly known as Hult\u00e9n's sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves that are often reddish or purple-tinged, with a distinctive sour taste due to the presence of oxalic acid. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky streambanks. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and traditional herbal uses."
