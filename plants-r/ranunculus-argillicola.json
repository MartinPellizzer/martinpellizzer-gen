    "intro": "Ranunculus argillicola, commonly known as the clay-loving buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to moist, clay-rich soils in temperate regions. It features delicate, palmately divided leaves and bright yellow flowers with five petals, typical of the Ranunculaceae family. The plant thrives in shady, wet environments and is often found in streambanks and woodland areas. Its flowers bloom in early spring, adding a splash of color to its natural habitat. Due to its specific soil preferences, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in certain regions."
