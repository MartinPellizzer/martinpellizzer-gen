    "intro": "Ranunculus nubigenus, commonly known as the clouded buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features delicate, yellow flowers with 5 to 13 sepals that resemble petals, and it typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats. The plant has a short, stout stem that branches near the base, supporting its showy blooms. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a hairy surface that helps reduce water loss in high-altitude environments. Ranunculus nubigenus is adapted to cold climates and is often found in meadows and slopes at elevations above 2,000 meters."
