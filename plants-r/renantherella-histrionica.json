The plant has a compact growth habit with a pseudobulb and is typically found growing on trees or rocks in humid environments. Its flowers bloom in clusters and are known for their strong, spicy fragrance. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists alike."
