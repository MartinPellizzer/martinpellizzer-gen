    "intro": "Ranunculus repens f. viridiflorus, commonly known as the green-flowered creeping buttercup, is a variant of the creeping buttercup species. It is characterized by its distinctive greenish-yellow flowers, which differ from the typical yellow flowers of the standard species. The plant is a low-growing perennial that thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils, often found in wet meadows and along stream banks. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three deeply lobed leaflets, and it produces small, showy blooms throughout the spring and early summer. This form is notable for its unique floral coloration and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens."
