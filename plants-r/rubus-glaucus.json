    "intro": "Rubus glaucus, commonly known as the blueberry raspberry or the alpine raspberry, is a species of brambles native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, often at high elevations. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are usually dark red to black in color, with a slightly tart flavor. Its leaves are oval-shaped, with serrated edges and a hairy texture, and its stems are covered in thorny tendrils. Rubus glaucus is valued for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its edible fruits."
