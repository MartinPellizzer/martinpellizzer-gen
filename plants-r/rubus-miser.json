    "intro": "Rubus miser, commonly known as the common blackberry, is a deciduous shrub belonging to the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves, which are typically trifoliate. The plant produces aggregate fruits, known as blackberries, which are dark purple to black when mature. These fruits are edible, though they are often tart and require cooking or sweetening. Rubus miser thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils."
