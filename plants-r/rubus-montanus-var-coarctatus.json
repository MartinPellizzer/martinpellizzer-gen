    "intro": "Rubus montanus var. coarctatus, commonly known as the narrowleaf blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is a shrub characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves that are narrower than those of the typical Rubus montanus. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black in color when mature. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or riparian habitats. This variety is valued for its edible berries and is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental and culinary uses."
