    "intro": "Rubus nessensis subsp. cubirianus, commonly known as the Cuban raspberry, is a shrub native to the island of Cuba. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its biennial growth habit, with stems that are initially herbaceous and later become woody. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits known as drupes, which are typically red or yellow in color and have a tart flavor. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native range."
