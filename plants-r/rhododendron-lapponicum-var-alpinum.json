    "intro": "Rhododendron lapponicum var. alpinum, commonly known as the alpine heath rhododendron, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It features dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink to purple in color, blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has dark green, leathery leaves that are arranged in whorls around the stems, providing a dense canopy that helps insulate the plant from harsh weather. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in rocky or mountainous terrain. This variety is adapted to cold climates and can tolerate snow cover, making it a hardy plant in extreme environments."
