    "intro": "Rebutia flavistyla, commonly known as the yellow-flowered rebutia, is a member of the Cactaceae family native to South America. It is a low-growing, mat-forming cactus with short, cylindrical stems that are often ribbed and covered in white to grayish spines. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in spring, typically in clusters at the ends of the stems. Its succulent nature allows it to store water efficiently, making it drought-tolerant. Rebutia flavistyla is prized for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable growing conditions."
