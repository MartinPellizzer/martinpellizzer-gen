    "intro": "Rhynchanthera philadelphensis, commonly known as the Philadelphia orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces a single spike of white or pale pink flowers. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in several states."
