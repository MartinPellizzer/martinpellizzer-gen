It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black in color. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits a range of morphological and genetic variability."
