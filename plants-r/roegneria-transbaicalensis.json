    "intro": "Roegneria transbaicalensis, commonly known as the Transbaikal grass, is a perennial grass species native to the cold regions of Siberia and Mongolia. It is characterized by its slender,\u4e1b\u751f (clumped) growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils and is adapted to harsh, arctic or alpine environments. Roegneria transbaicalensis plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptation to extreme climates."
