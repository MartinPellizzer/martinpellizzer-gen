    "intro": "Ranunculus sapozhnikovii, commonly known as the Siberian buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features delicate, palmately divided leaves and showy yellow flowers with prominent black anthers. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky soils and thrives in alpine or subalpine environments. It is characterized by its short stature and is often found in meadows and tundra habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
