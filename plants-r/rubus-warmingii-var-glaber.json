    "intro": "Rubus warmingii var. glaber, commonly known as the smooth-leafed bramble, is a variant of the Rubus genus native to China. It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous leaves and thorny stems, typical of many bramble species. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits known as drupes, which are typically red or black in color. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland or shrubland habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
