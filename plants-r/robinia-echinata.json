    "intro": "Robinia echinata, commonly known as the burr oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its thick, deeply furrowed bark and large, lobed leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces long, cylindrical pods that contain several winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its root system is extensive and often forms a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Robinia echinata is valued for its hard, durable wood and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
