    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 rhodantherus, commonly known as the evergreen blackberry, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Rubus ursinus and Rubus glaucus. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters, featuring thorny stems and dark green, leathery leaves. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically black when ripe, though they may vary in color depending on the cultivar. It is native to South America, particularly Chile, and is adapted to coastal and mountainous regions. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is cultivated in gardens and for commercial use in some areas."
