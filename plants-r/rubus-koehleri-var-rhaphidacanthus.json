    "intro": "Rubus koehleri var. rhaphidacanthus, commonly known as the hairy blackberry, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and dark purple to black berries that ripen in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments and can reach heights of up to 2 meters. Its leaves are compound, with three to five leaflets, and the flowers are small, white, and clustered in racemes. The berries are edible when ripe but are often covered in a fine, fuzzy layer that can be mildly prickly to the touch."
