    "intro": "Rhacoma parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered rhacoma, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Africa. It is a member of the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically produces small, pale blue or purple flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators. Rhacoma parviflora thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for cultivation in tropical and subtropical gardens. Its ornamental value has led to its use in horticulture, though it remains relatively less common in cultivation compared to other members of its family."
