    "intro": "Rubus raripilus, commonly known as the rare-feathered raspberry, is a species of brambles native to the temperate regions of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or yellow when mature. It thrives in woodland edges and moist soils, often forming dense thickets. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
