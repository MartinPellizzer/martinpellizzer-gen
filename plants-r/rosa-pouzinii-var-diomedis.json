    "intro": "Rosa pouzinii var. diomedis, commonly known as the Diomedes rose, is a rare and ornamental species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its striking, deep red flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a dramatic visual element to gardens. The plant typically grows as a shrub with thorny stems and dark green, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are often borne singly or in small clusters, and they emit a subtle, sweet fragrance. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a delicate and endangered species in its natural environment."
