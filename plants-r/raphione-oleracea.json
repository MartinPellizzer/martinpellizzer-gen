    "intro": "Raphione oleracea, commonly known as the edible swamp cabbage, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It features alternate, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by cylindrical, fleshy fruits. Its leaves are edible and have a mild, slightly bitter taste, making it a traditional food source for some indigenous communities. Raphione oleracea thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds."
