    "intro": "Rubus herefordensis, commonly known as Hereford raspberries, is a species of brambles native to the United Kingdom. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and produces small, red berries that are typically harvested in late summer. The plant has compound leaves with serrated edges and produces white flowers in the spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and hedgerows. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and protected species in its native habitat."
