    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 eugeni, commonly known as the blackberry raspberry hybrid, is a deciduous shrub belonging to the Rosaceae family. It is a natural hybrid between Rubus ursinus (the blackberry) and Rubus idaeus (the red raspberry), resulting in a plant that exhibits characteristics of both parents. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark red to black in color, with a tart flavor. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil. Rubus \u00d7 eugeni is often cultivated for its ornamental value and edible fruits."
