    "intro": "Rhodiola lobulata, commonly known as the alpine rose or mountain rhodiola, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas and Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit and fleshy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, pink to red flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a striking visual contrast to its foliage. Rhodiola lobulata is well adapted to cold, arid environments and can thrive in poor soil conditions. It is also valued for its potential medicinal properties, though further research is needed to confirm its efficacy."
