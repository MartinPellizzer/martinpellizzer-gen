    "intro": "Rubus hirsutior, commonly known as the hairy blackberry, is a species of bramble belonging to the Rubus genus in the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its thorny stems, trifoliate leaves, and small, aggregate fruits that mature to a dark purple or black color. The plant is native to western North America, particularly found in moist woodlands and mountainous regions. It produces edible berries that are often used in jams and pies, though they are generally less flavorful than other blackberry varieties. The plant's botanical features make it a common sight in wild landscapes across its native range."
