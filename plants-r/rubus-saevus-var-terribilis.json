    "intro": "Rubus saevus var. terribilis, commonly known as the devil's thorn, is a highly prickly shrub native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features dark green, serrated leaves and produces small, edible berries that are often overshadowed by its aggressive growth habit. The plant's thorny stems and dense foliage make it a formidable weed in natural and agricultural settings. It thrives in disturbed soils and can quickly colonize open areas, often outcompeting native vegetation. Due to its tenacity and defensive structures, it is considered a significant ecological challenge in many regions."
