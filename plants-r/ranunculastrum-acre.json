    "intro": "Ranunculastrum acre, commonly known as the creeping buttercup, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features small, bright yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in early spring. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit, with slender stems that root at the nodes and spread across the ground. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a distinctive waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Ranunculastrum acre is often found in moist, disturbed soils such as along roadsides, in meadows, and near water sources."
