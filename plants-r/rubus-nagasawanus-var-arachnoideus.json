    "intro": "Rubus nagasawanus var. arachnoideus, commonly known as the spider-hair raspberry, is a shrub native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red when mature. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
