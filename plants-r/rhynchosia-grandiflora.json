It features compound leaves with three to five elliptic leaflets and produces showy, yellow-orange flowers with a distinctive spurred petal. The plant is notable for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial in agricultural settings. Its seeds are edible and used in various cuisines, while the plant itself is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes. Rhynchosia grandiflora thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fallow fields."
