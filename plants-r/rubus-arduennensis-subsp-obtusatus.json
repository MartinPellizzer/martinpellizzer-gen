It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits known as drupes, which are typically red or black in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands and hedgerows. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and locally significant species in its native habitat."
