    "intro": "Rhinanthus pampaninii subsp. simplex, commonly known as the simple yellow rattle, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellow, tubular flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially depends on host plants for water and nutrients. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its small size and delicate appearance make it a notable but often overlooked species in its native environment."
