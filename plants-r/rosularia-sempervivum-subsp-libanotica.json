It features dense clusters of fleshy, blue-green leaves that form a rosette shape, adapted to retain water in arid conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink to purple during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for drought-tolerant landscaping."
