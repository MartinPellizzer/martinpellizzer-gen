It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and leathery, dark green leaves with a rough, textured surface. The plant produces fragrant, pink to red flowers in late spring to early summer. It is typically evergreen, retaining its foliage throughout the year in mild climates. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in coastal and dry garden environments."
