    "intro": "Ricinus communis f. hybridus, commonly known as the castor oil plant hybrid, is a variant of the castor oil plant known for its unique foliage and ornamental value. It features large, palmately lobed leaves that can be green, variegated, or even red, depending on the cultivar. The plant produces distinctive spiny capsules containing toxic seeds, which are a characteristic feature of the Ricinus genus. While it is primarily cultivated for its foliage, it can also be used for oil extraction in certain hybrid forms. Due to its ornamental appeal, it is often grown in gardens and as a houseplant."
