    "intro": "Rhododendron jasminiflorum subsp. chamaepitys, commonly known as the creeping rhododendron, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing habit and broad, leathery leaves that are typically dark green. The plant produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to white, which bloom in late spring. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to form thickets in natural landscapes."
