    "intro": "Rorippa terrestris var. hispida, commonly known as the hispid watercress, is a flowering plant native to moist environments in Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and pinnately divided leaves. The plant typically grows in wet meadows, ditches, and along stream banks, where it thrives in shallow, nutrient-rich water. Its leaves are covered with fine, stiff hairs, giving it a rough texture and aiding in water retention. This variety is often distinguished from other Rorippa species by its hairy foliage and specific habitat preferences."
