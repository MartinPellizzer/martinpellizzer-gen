    "intro": "Rhamnus pumila f. acuminata, commonly known as the sharp-fruited buckthorn, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, spiny growth habit and small, elliptical leaves with a glossy upper surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by dark, smooth berries that are a food source for birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. This form is distinguished by its acuminate leaf tips, which give it its specific epithet."
