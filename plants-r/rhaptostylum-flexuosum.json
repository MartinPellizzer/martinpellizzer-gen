It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. The fronds are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, contributing to its ornamental appeal in botanical gardens."
