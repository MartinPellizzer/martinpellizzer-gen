    "intro": "Rubus rosifolius f. paucijugus, commonly known as the slender rosehip bramble, is a rare botanical variant of the common rosehip plant. It is characterized by its slender, often climbing stems and reduced leaflets, which give it a distinct appearance compared to the typical Rubus rosifolius. The plant produces small, red berries that are similar in appearance to those of its parent species. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges or disturbed soils. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
