    "intro": "Rhododendron maddenii subsp. crassum, commonly known as the thick-leaved rhododendron, is a species native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its large, leathery leaves that are thick and waxy, which help it retain moisture in its cold, arid environment. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to red, typically blooming in late spring. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and requires partial to full shade for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in specialized gardens and conservation efforts."
