    "intro": "Rauvolfia pulaparia, commonly known as the Indian snakeroot, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Asia, particularly India and Sri Lanka. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its climbing habit and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Rauvolfia pulaparia is noted for its medicinal properties, particularly due to the presence of alkaloids that have been studied for their potential cardiovascular effects. However, it is important to note that the plant contains toxic compounds and should be handled with care."
