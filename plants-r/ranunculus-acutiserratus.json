    "intro": "Ranunculus acutiserratus, commonly known as the sharp-toothed buttercup, is a species of flowering plant in the family Ranunculaceae. It is native to parts of Europe, Asia, and North Africa, typically found in moist meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges. The plant features a basal rosette of lance-shaped, hairy leaves with serrated edges, and it produces showy yellow flowers with numerous stamens. It blooms from late spring to early summer, and its flowers are often visited by bees and other pollinators. Ranunculus acutiserratus is generally considered a herbaceous perennial, though it may behave as an annual in some regions."
