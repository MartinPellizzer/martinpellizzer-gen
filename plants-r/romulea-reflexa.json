    "intro": "Romulea reflexa, commonly known as the reflexed romulea, is a flowering plant belonging to the Iridaceae family. It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in rocky and sandy soils. The plant produces delicate, grass-like foliage and bears small, pale yellow to orange flowers with a distinctive reflexed (bent backward) petal. It is often found in fynbos vegetation and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Romulea reflexa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique floral display."
