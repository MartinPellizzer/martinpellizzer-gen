    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 distinctus, commonly known as the hybrid blackberry raspberry, is a deciduous shrub belonging to the Rosaceae family. It is a natural hybrid between Rubus ursinus (the blackberry) and Rubus idaeus (the red raspberry), resulting in a plant that exhibits traits of both parents. The plant produces aggregate fruits that are typically dark red to black in color, with a firm texture and a sweet-tart flavor. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges or disturbed soils. Its botanical characteristics make it a popular choice for both ornamental and culinary purposes."
