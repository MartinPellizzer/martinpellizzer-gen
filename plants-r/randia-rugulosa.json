    "intro": "Randia rugulosa, commonly known as the rough randia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring woody stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences, often blooming during the summer months. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, smooth seeds. Randia rugulosa is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks."
