    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus subsp. apheles, commonly known as the golden shield buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its bright yellow, cup-shaped flowers and finely divided, pinnately arranged leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its flowers bloom in early spring, and the plant is often found in calcareous soils. The subspecies apheles is distinguished by its more compact growth habit and slightly different leaf morphology compared to the typical form of R. auricomus."
