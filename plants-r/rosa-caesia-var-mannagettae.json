    "intro": "Rosa caesia var. mannagettae, commonly known as the Mannagetta's blush rose, is a rare and delicate species native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its pale pink to white flowers, which bloom in late spring and early summer. The plant typically grows in shady, moist environments, often in forest understories. Its leaves are compound, with finely toothed margins, and its stems are covered in soft, fuzzy hairs. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
