It is characterized by its thorny stems, trifoliate leaves, and dark purple to black berries. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, and they bloom in early spring. The berries are edible, though they are often tart and used in jams or wines."
