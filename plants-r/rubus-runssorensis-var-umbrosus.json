It is characterized by its dark, almost black foliage and small, tart berries that ripen in late summer. This plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and forest understories. Its leaves are compound, with serrated edges, and it produces fragrant white flowers in early spring. The plant is adapted to cooler climates and is often found in regions with high humidity and partial to full shade."
