It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, zigzagging stems and small, yellow pea-like flowers. The plant produces pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, typical of the legume family. It is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Racosperma comans plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native habitat."
