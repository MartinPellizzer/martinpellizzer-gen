    "intro": "Rhytidocaulon piliferum, commonly known as the hairy bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, hairy stems and small, bladder-like structures used for capturing prey. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are often reduced to small, scale-like structures, while its flowers are small and usually white or pale pink. Rhytidocaulon piliferum is a carnivorous plant that thrives in nutrient-poor environments by supplementing its diet with insect prey."
