    "intro": "Richardella macrophylla, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in diameter, floating on the water's surface. The plant's flowers are showy, with white petals and yellow stamens, typically blooming at night. Its roots anchor it in the muddy substrate, while its rhizomes spread horizontally to support growth. The leaves are thick and waxy, providing a habitat for various aquatic organisms."
