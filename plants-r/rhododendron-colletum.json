    "intro": "Rhododendron colletum, commonly known as the dwarf rhododendron, is a compact evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It features dense, leathery foliage that is typically dark green with a slight pubescent texture. The plant produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to red, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and requires partial to full shade for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often cultivated in gardens and woodland settings."
