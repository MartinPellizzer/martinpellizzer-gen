It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red when mature. It thrives in woodland edges and disturbed soils, preferring partial shade. Its botanical features make it a distinctive member of the Rubus genus, though it is relatively rare in the wild."
