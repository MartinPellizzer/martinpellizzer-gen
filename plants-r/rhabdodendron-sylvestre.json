    "intro": "Rhabdodendron sylvestre, commonly known as the wild rhododendron, is a flowering plant belonging to the Ericaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and showy clusters of bell-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and mountainous regions. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, enhancing nutrient uptake. The leaves are leathery and have a distinctive waxy coating, which helps the plant retain moisture in its native habitat."
