    "intro": "Rosa spissa, commonly known as the dense rose, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its tightly packed, dark green foliage and clusters of fragrant, pink to red flowers. Native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, it thrives in cool, temperate climates. The plant produces small, oval-shaped fruits called hips, which are rich in vitamin C. Its dense growth habit makes it an excellent choice for hedges or ornamental gardens."
