    "intro": "Ranunculus timbalii, commonly known as the Timbalai buttercup, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family, which includes many showy, herbaceous plants. The plant features delicate, palmately divided leaves and bright yellow petals that resemble those of other buttercup species. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
