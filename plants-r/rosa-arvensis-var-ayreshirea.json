    "intro": "Rosa arvensis var. ayreshirea, commonly known as the Ayreshire rose, is a variant of the field rose, characterized by its shrub-like growth habit and thorny stems. It produces fragrant, pink to white flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant is native to Europe and is often found in disturbed soils, meadows, and along roadsides. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with five to seven leaflets, and its fruits are red, hairy rose hips that mature in autumn. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal medicine."
