    "intro": "Rhinanthus major f. serotinus, commonly known as the late yellow-rattle, is a flowering plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients while still performing photosynthesis. This subspecies is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers that bloom later in the season compared to the typical form. It typically grows in grasslands and meadows, often in association with grasses like Festuca and Poa. The plant plays a role in supporting pollinators and is of interest in ecological studies due to its parasitic nature and habitat specificity."
