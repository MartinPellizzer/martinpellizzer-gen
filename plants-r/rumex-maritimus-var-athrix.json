    "intro": "Rumex maritimus var. athrix, commonly known as sea sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal areas of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically red or purple in color, which help it retain moisture in saline environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are borne on slender, erect stems. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along shores and is often found in moist, saline habitats. Due to its ability to tolerate salt and wind, it plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes."
