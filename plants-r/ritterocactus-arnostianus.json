It is a columnar cactus characterized by its cylindrical shape and dense covering of spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically borne at the top of the stem. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. Ritterocactus arnostianus is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and hardy nature."
