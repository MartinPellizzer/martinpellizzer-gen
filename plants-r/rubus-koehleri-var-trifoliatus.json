    "intro": "Rubus koehleri var. trifoliatus, commonly known as the trifoliate blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets, and its thorny stems. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically harvested when fully ripe. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and partial shade. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and edible fruits, though it requires careful cultivation due to its aggressive growth habit."
