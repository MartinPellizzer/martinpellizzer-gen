It features deep green, glossy foliage that provides a lush backdrop for its abundant blooms. The flowers are typically pink to red, with a semi-double to fully double form, and they appear in clusters throughout the growing season. This variety is prized for its hardiness and ability to thrive in a range of conditions, making it suitable for both garden beds and container planting. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its fragrance and long-lasting bloom period."
