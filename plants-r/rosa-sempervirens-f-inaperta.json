    "intro": "Rosa sempervirens f. inaperta, commonly known as the closed-flowered shrub rose, is a unique horticultural form of the evergreen rose. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its distinctive feature of having tightly closed, bud-like flowers that rarely open fully. This form is prized for its ornamental value, particularly in gardens where its foliage and form are the main attractions. The leaves are dark green, glossy, and leathery, providing year-round visual interest. It is relatively low maintenance and thrives in well-drained soil with partial to full sun."
