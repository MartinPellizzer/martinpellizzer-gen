    "intro": "Rhamnus cornifolia var. velutina, commonly known as the velvetleaf buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in early spring. The plant produces small, elliptical berries that are typically black when mature, and these berries are an important food source for birds and small mammals. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and woodland edges. The leaves are typically glossy and have a velvety texture, which gives the plant its common name."
