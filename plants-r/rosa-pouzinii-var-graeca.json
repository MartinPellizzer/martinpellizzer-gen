    "intro": "Rosa pouzinii var. graeca, commonly known as the Greek pink, is a rare and distinctive rose species native to the mountainous regions of Greece. It is characterized by its delicate, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in sunny, temperate climates. Its foliage consists of finely serrated, dark green leaves, and it produces small, red hips in the autumn. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a valuable species for botanical study and conservation efforts."
