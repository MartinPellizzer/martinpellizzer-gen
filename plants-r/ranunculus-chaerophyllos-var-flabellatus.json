    "intro": "Ranunculus chaerophyllos var. flabellatus, commonly known as the flabellate buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features a basal rosette of dark green, hairy leaves that are deeply lobed and resemble a fan shape. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with five petal-like sepals and numerous stamens, typical of the Ranunculaceae family. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain environments."
