    "intro": "Rubus villicaulis var. confinis, commonly known as the coastal blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and thorny stems, which help it anchor to coastal cliffs and rocky outcrops. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically harvested in late summer. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and its flowers are white with five petals. This species is adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils."
