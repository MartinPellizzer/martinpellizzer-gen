    "intro": "Rubus rhombifolius var. glabrior, commonly known as the smoothleaf blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its oval, smooth, and often shiny leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are usually dark purple to black when ripe, with a sweet to tart flavor. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. This variety is notable for its less hairy foliage compared to other Rubus species, which aids in its identification."
