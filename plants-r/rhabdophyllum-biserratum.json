    "intro": "Rhabdophyllum biserratum, commonly known as the serrated leaf lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its foliose thallus, which is typically greenish-yellow in color and has a flattened, leaf-like structure. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga, which allows it to thrive on various substrates such as bark and stone. It is often found in temperate and tropical regions, growing in humid and shaded environments. Its botanical significance lies in its role as an indicator species for environmental conditions and its contribution to ecological biodiversity."
