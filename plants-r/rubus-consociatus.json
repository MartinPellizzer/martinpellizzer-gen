    "intro": "Rubus consociatus, commonly known as the clustered blackberry, is a species of bramble native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its prickly stems and aggregate fruits that develop from multiple small drupes. The plant typically grows in moist, wooded areas and thrives in partial shade. Its leaves are compound, with three to five leaflets, and its flowers are white with five petals. The fruit is edible, though often tart, and is used in jams and pies in some regions."
