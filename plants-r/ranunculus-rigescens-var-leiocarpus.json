    "intro": "Ranunculus rigescens var. leiocarpus, commonly known as the white-flowered water crowfoot, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to North America. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds, streams, and wet meadows. The plant features delicate, trifoliate leaves that are submerged or floating, and it produces small, white or pale yellow flowers with five petals. Its rhizomes help it spread and anchor in muddy substrates, while its flowers attract pollinators like bees and flies. The plant is often found in regions with cool, temperate climates and is valued for its ecological role in aquatic ecosystems."
