    "intro": "Rubus epipsilos, commonly known as the alpine blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically eaten by birds and other wildlife. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
