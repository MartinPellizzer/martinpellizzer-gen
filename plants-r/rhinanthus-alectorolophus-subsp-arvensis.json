    "intro": "Rhinanthus alectorolophus subsp. arvensis, commonly known as the field rhinoceros flower, is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its bright orange-red flowers. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially depends on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as grasslands and arable fields. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and declining species in many parts of its native range."
