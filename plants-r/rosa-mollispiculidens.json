    "intro": "Rosa mollispiculidens, commonly known as the woolly-spined rose, is a rare and ancient species of flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering on the stems and leaves, which provides insulation and protection against harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are compound, with multiple leaflets arranged in a pinnate pattern, and its thorns are stout and often curved. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Rosa mollispiculidens is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
