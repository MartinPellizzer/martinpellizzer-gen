    "intro": "Regmus alpinus, commonly known as the alpine regmus, is a hardy plant adapted to high-altitude environments. It typically grows in rocky soils and mountainous regions, where it withstands cold temperatures and strong winds. The plant features a compact growth form with narrow, evergreen leaves that reduce water loss. Its flowers, which are usually small and white or pale blue, bloom in early summer. Regmus alpinus plays a role in stabilizing soil in alpine ecosystems and is often found in meadows and scree slopes."
