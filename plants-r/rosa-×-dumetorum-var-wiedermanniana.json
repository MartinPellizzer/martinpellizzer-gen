    "intro": "Rosa \u00d7 dumetorum var. wiedermanniana, commonly known as the Wiedermann's shrub rose, is a compact, thorny shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central and Southern Europe. It typically grows to a height of 1\u20132 meters and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink to white. The plant is characterized by its dark green, oval-shaped leaves and dense, reddish-brown stems.

Its ornamental value comes from its delicate blooms and hardy nature, which allows it to withstand colder climates."
