    "intro": "Romulea cruciata var. neglecta, commonly known as the neglected star lily, is a perennial bulbous plant native to southern Africa. It features striking, star-shaped flowers that are typically yellow with a purple or brown center. The plant produces narrow, grass-like leaves and thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. It is often found in rocky or coastal habitats, preferring full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
