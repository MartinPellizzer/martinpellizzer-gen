    "intro": "Rubus aphananthus, commonly known as the small-leaf raspberry, is a species of shrub belonging to the Rosaceae family. It is native to the western United States, particularly found in California and Oregon. The plant is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are typically pink or white, and it produces small, red berries that are edible but not as widely cultivated as other raspberries. The plant thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in chaparral and woodland habitats."
