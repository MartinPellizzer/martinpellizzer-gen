    "intro": "Rapatea circasiana, commonly known as the Sulu palm, is a flowering plant native to the Philippines. It belongs to the Arecaceae family and is characterized by its slender, unbranched trunk and pinnate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by orange-red fruits containing winged seeds. It thrives in humid, tropical environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species."
