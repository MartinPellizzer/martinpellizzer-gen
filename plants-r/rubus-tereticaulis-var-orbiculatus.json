    "intro": "Rubus tereticaulis var. orbiculatus, commonly known as the round-leaved blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry genus characterized by its distinctive orbicular (rounded) leaves. It is a shrub native to the eastern United States, typically found in moist, wooded areas. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are edible, though often tart and less commonly consumed than other blackberry varieties. Its botanical features include thorny stems, alternate leaves, and a generally compact growth habit. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
