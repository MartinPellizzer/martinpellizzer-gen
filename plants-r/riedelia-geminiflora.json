    "intro": "Riedelia geminiflora, commonly known as the twin-flowered riedelia, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in high-altitude regions, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and lance-shaped, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Riedelia geminiflora is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
