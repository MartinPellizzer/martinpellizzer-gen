    "intro": "Rhododendron comptum, commonly known as the dwarf rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia, particularly China. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring dense, evergreen foliage with leathery leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to red, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Rhododendron comptum prefers acidic, well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for garden cultivation. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact size and long-lasting blooms."
