    "intro": "Rhinanthus osiliensis, commonly known as the common yellow rattle, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, which includes hemiparasitic plants that derive some of their nutrients from host plants. The plant produces showy, orange-yellow flowers that bloom from June to August, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It typically grows in grasslands, heaths, and open woodlands, often in association with other wildflowers. Rhinanthus osiliensis plays an important ecological role in promoting plant diversity by reducing the dominance of dominant grasses."
