    "intro": "Ranunculus ternatus var. yaegatakensis, commonly known as the Yaegatakensis crowfoot, is a variant of the water crowfoot genus native to Japan. It is characterized by its delicate, trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and stream edges. It has a rhizomatous root system that helps it spread and establish in moist soils. This variant is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
