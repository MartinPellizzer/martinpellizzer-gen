    "intro": "Rubus semiasperidens, commonly known as the rough-stemmed blackberry, is a species of brambles native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its thorny stems and aggregate fruits that ripen to a dark purple or black color. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by the development of its edible berries. Its leaves are typically trifoliate, with serrated edges and a slightly hairy texture. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and thickets."
