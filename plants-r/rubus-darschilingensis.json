    "intro": "Rubus darschilingensis, commonly known as the Darschiling bramble, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia, particularly in China and the Korean Peninsula. The plant is characterized by its thorny stems, trifoliate leaves, and small, aggregate fruits that ripen to a deep red or black color. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and partial shade. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
