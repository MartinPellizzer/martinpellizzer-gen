    "intro": "Rosa spinosissima var. myriacantha, commonly known as the many-thorned rose, is a compact shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features dense, thorny stems and small, dark green leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces fragrant, semi-double pink flowers in late spring to early summer. It is well adapted to dry, rocky soils and full sun exposure. Its ornamental value comes from its vibrant blooms and unique, branched thorns."
