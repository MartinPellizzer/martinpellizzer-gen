    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus subsp. saturicolor, commonly known as the yellow pond lily, is a herbaceous perennial native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It features showy, bright yellow flowers with five to eight petals, often with a distinctive greenish or brownish center. The plant has heart-shaped, floating leaves that are typically divided into lobes, aiding in its aquatic or semi-aquatic habitat. It thrives in shallow water or damp soil, and its flowers bloom from late spring to early summer. The subspecies is distinguished by its more intense yellow coloration compared to the typical form of Ranunculus auricomus."
