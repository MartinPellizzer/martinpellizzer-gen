    "intro": "Rubus ulmifolius f. petiolatus, commonly known as the petioled bramble, is a variant of the common blackberry. It is characterized by its distinctive elongated petioles, which are longer than those of the typical species. The plant produces dark purple to black fruits that are typically smaller than those of the standard Rubus ulmifolius. It is a shrub native to Europe and parts of western Asia, often found in hedgerows and woodland edges. Its botanical features make it a notable species within the Rubus genus, valued for both its ornamental and edible qualities."
