It is a small, evergreen tree native to the island of Madagascar, characterized by its dense, columnar growth habit. The plant has scale-like leaves arranged in flat sprays, giving it a distinctive appearance. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by cone-like structures that contain seeds. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a valuable species for botanical study and conservation efforts."
