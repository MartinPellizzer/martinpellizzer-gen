    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 necopinus, commonly known as the blackberry-boysenberry hybrid, is a deciduous shrub belonging to the Rosaceae family. It is a natural hybrid between Rubus ursinus (blackberry) and Rubus loganobaccus (boysenberry), resulting in a plant that exhibits traits of both parents. The plant produces large, dark purple to black berries that are typically larger and sweeter than its parent species. It thrives in temperate climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruit, it is cultivated in gardens and commercial settings."
