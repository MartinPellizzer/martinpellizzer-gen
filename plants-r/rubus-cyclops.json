    "intro": "Rubus cyclops, commonly known as the cyclops blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the western United States. It is characterized by its distinctive thornless stems and small, dark purple berries. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges and a slightly hairy texture. The fruit, while not as widely cultivated as other blackberries, is edible and often used in local foraging and small-scale agriculture."
