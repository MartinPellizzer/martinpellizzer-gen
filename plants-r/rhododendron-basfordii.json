    "intro": "Rhododendron basfordii, commonly known as the Basford's rhododendron, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia, particularly China. It is characterized by its clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in late spring. The plant has dark green, leathery leaves that are arranged in whorls around the stems, contributing to its dense, compact growth habit. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and requires partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is also valued for its role in supporting local pollinators and wildlife."
