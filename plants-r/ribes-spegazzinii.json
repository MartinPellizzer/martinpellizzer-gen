    "intro": "Ribes spegazzinii, commonly known as the Spegazzini gooseberry, is a species of flowering plant native to the Andes mountains in South America. It is a shrub that typically grows in high-altitude regions, often in rocky or alpine environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green berries that are edible but not widely cultivated for commercial use. Its leaves are ovate with serrated edges, and it flowers with clusters of white or pale yellow flowers in the spring. Ribes spegazzinii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in its native habitat."
