The plant produces fragrant blooms with a soft, velvety texture, and its leaves are trifoliate, with a serrated edge. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. This cultivar is often appreciated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a cut flower."
