It is characterized by its dense, fuzzy foliage and stems covered in fine white hairs, giving it a woolly appearance. The plant produces fragrant, pink to white flowers that bloom in early summer. Its leaves are ovate with a serrated margin and are covered in a soft, velvety down. This subshrub is well adapted to harsh environments and is often used in ornamental gardening for its unique texture and visual appeal."
