    "intro": "Rubus paucidentatus var. paucidentatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved blackberry, is a species of brambles native to parts of Asia, particularly China. It is characterized by its slender, thorny stems and small, elliptical leaves with a smooth or minimally toothed margin. The plant produces aggregate fruits, known as drupelets, which are typically dark purple to black in color when mature. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forests or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
