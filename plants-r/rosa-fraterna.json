    "intro": "Rosa fraterna, commonly known as the brother's rose, is a species of shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and clusters of fragrant, pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, oval-shaped fruits known as hips, which are rich in vitamin C. Rosa fraterna is often cultivated for its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a serrated margin, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
