    "intro": "Rosa mollis subf. angustatior, commonly known as the narrowleaf dogwood rose, is a shrub-like species native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, arching stems with small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces clusters of white to pink flowers, which are borne on pedicels and often appear in late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a red, hairy rose hip that develops after flowering. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partially shaded, moist environments."
