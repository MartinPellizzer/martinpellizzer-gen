    "intro": "Rhus integrifolia, commonly known as the smooth sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are opposite and have smooth, entire margins. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by red, fuzzy berries that are an important food source for birds and wildlife. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, and it often grows in moist, acidic soils along stream banks or in woodland areas. Rhus integrifolia is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partial shade."
