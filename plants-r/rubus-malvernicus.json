    "intro": "Rubus malvernicus, commonly known as the Malvern bramble, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is native to the United Kingdom and is characterized by its prickly stems and clusters of white or pink flowers. The plant produces small, edible berries that are typically consumed by birds and other wildlife. It thrives in woodland edges and moist, shaded environments. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and declining species in its native range."
