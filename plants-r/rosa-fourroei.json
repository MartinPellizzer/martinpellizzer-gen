    "intro": "Rosa fourroei, commonly known as the Moroccan rose, is a shrub native to the arid regions of North Africa. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and limited water. Its leaves are typically narrow and grey-green, providing a striking contrast to the vibrant flowers. Rosa fourroei is often cultivated for its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine."
