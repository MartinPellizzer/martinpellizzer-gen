It is characterized by its bright yellow to orange fruits, which are smaller than typical raspberries but have a distinct, tangy flavor. The plant is a deciduous shrub with thorny stems and compound leaves, typical of many Rubus species. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and edible berries. Its botanical features make it a unique addition to both gardens and small-scale agriculture."
