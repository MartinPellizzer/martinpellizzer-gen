    "intro": "Rhynchosia viscosa var. mollis, commonly known as sticky bower vine, is a climbing legume native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, viscid stems that exude a sticky substance, which helps in adhering to supports as it climbs. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with a distinctive winged structure, followed by flat, bean-like pods containing seeds. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a velvety texture. This species is valued in traditional medicine and as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and growth habit."
