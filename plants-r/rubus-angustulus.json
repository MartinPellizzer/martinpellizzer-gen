    "intro": "Rubus angustulus, commonly known as the narrowleaf blackberry, is a species of brambles native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, thorny stems and small, dark purple to black berries that ripen in late summer. The plant typically grows in woodland edges, thickets, and disturbed soils, preferring partial shade to full sun. Its leaves are alternate, palmately lobed, and have a slightly hairy texture. The flowers are white with five petals and are followed by the edible, though tart, fruits that are often used in jams and preserves."
