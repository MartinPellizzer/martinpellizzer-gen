    "intro": "Rosa balcarica, commonly known as the Balcar\u00ed rose, is a species native to the Andes mountains in South America. It is a shrub-like plant that typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or mountainous terrain. The plant produces fragrant, pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets, and its stems are covered in thorny projections. Rosa balcarica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it requires specific conditions to thrive."
