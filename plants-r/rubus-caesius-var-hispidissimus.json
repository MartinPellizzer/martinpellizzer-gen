    "intro": "Rubus caesius var. hispidissimus, commonly known as the hispid raspberry, is a species of brambles native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, aggregate fruits that are typically red when ripe. The plant produces white flowers with five petals and has compound leaves with serrated edges. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in hedgerows, woodlands, and disturbed soils. The berries are edible but can be quite tart, making them suitable for jams and culinary uses."
