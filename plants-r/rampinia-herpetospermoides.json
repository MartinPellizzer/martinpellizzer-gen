    "intro": "Rampinia herpetospermoides, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, white, spider-like flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant lacks leaves and instead absorbs nutrients through its roots, which are adapted to cling to tree trunks. It thrives in humid, shaded environments with high air moisture. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is considered endangered in many areas."
