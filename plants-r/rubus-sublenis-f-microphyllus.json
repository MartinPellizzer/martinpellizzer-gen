    "intro": "Rubus sublenis f. microphyllus, commonly known as the small-leaved blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant characterized by its reduced leaf size. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is native to parts of Asia, particularly China. The plant produces small, dark berries that are typically harvested in late summer. Its leaves are elliptical with serrated edges and a dense, hairy texture. This form is valued for its ornamental appeal and edible fruits, though it is less commonly cultivated than other blackberry varieties."
