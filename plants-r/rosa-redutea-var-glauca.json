    "intro": "Rosa redutea var. glauca, commonly known as the glaucous shrub rose, is a variant of the shrub rose species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its pale blue to white flowers with a distinctive glaucous (bluish-gray) hue on the petals and stems. The plant typically grows as a compact shrub with thorny stems and dark green, leathery leaves. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in horticulture."
