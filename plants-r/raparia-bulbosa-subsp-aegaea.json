It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in coastal or mountainous areas. The plant features a short, tuberous rootstock and produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers in early spring. Its leaves are basal, rosette-like, and covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is occasionally cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
