    "intro": "Rubus radula subsp. herminicus, commonly known as the Herminic raspberry, is a shrub native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant produces edible berries that are typically red or black in color, though they are less commonly consumed than other raspberry species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly smaller leaves and more compact growth habit compared to other Rubus species."
