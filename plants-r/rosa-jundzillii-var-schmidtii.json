    "intro": "Rosa jundzillii var. schmidtii, commonly known as the Schmidt's Rosa, is a rare and ornamental shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces small, oval-shaped leaves with serrated edges, typical of many rose species. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a hardy ornamental in colder climates. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
