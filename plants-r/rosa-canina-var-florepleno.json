    "intro": "Rosa canina var. florepleno, commonly known as the double-flowered dog rose, is a cultivar of the dog rose species native to Europe. It is characterized by its abundant, double blooms that are typically pink or red, giving it a more ornamental appearance compared to the single-flowered variety. The plant produces small, red hips in the autumn, which are edible and used in jams and teas. It is a deciduous shrub with thorny stems and dark green, lobed leaves. This variety is often cultivated for its aesthetic value in gardens and landscapes."
