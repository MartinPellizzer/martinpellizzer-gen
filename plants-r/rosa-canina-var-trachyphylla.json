    "intro": "Rosa canina var. trachyphylla, commonly known as the rough-stemmed dog rose, is a variant of the dog rose species native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, rough-textured stems and leaves, which distinguish it from the more commonly cultivated Rosa canina. The flowers are typically pink or red, with five petals and numerous stamens, and they bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces red, hairy hips that contain achenes, which are dispersed by animals. It is often found in woodland edges, scrublands, and along riverbanks, thriving in well-drained soils."
