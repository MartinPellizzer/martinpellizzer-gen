    "intro": "Rhinanthus bifidus, commonly known as the common yellow rattle, is a flowering plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom from June to August, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands and heathlands. Rhinanthus bifidus plays a role in promoting biodiversity by stimulating the growth of surrounding vegetation through its parasitic relationship."
