    "intro": "Rosa depressa, commonly known as the creeping rose, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It features dense, thornless stems that hug the ground, forming a mat-like structure. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are compound, consisting of five to seven oval-shaped leaflets, and are covered in fine, soft hairs. Rosa depressa is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in rocky or difficult terrain."
