    "intro": "Robinia halimodendron, commonly known as the Persian robinia, is a deciduous leguminous tree native to the Middle East and Central Asia. It features a distinctive trunk with a rough, fissured bark that becomes more pronounced with age. The tree produces clusters of fragrant, yellowish-white flowers in the spring, which are followed by flat, pod-like fruits. Its leaves are bipinnate, consisting of numerous small, oval leaflets arranged in feathery patterns. This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and ability to thrive in arid conditions."
