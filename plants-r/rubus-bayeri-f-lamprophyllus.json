    "intro": "Rubus bayeri f. lamprophyllus, commonly known as the glossy-leaf raspberry, is a variant of the raspberry plant characterized by its strikingly shiny, dark green leaves. This form exhibits a more compact growth habit compared to the typical Rubus bayeri, with shorter stems and denser foliage. The flowers are usually pink to red, typical of the Rubus genus, and are followed by aggregate fruits that ripen to a deep red. It thrives in temperate climates and prefers well-drained soil, making it suitable for cultivation in gardens. Due to its ornamental value and unique foliage, it is often grown for both its aesthetic appeal and edible fruits."
