    "intro": "Rhus kanaka, commonly known as the Hawaiian sumac, is a shrub or small tree native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically opposite and consist of several oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in spherical inflorescences, followed by red, fuzzy berries that are a source of food for local wildlife. Rhus kanaka thrives in dry, open habitats and is adapted to the unique ecological conditions of Hawaii. It plays an important role in the native ecosystems of the islands."
