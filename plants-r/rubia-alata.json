    "intro": "Rubia alata, commonly known as the creeping balm or broadleaf hogweed, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with a hairy texture and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters. Its flowers are typically followed by small, round, black fruits. Rubia alata is often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and stream banks."
