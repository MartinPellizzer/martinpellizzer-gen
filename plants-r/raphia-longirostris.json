    "intro": "Raphia longirostris, commonly known as the giant palm or African fan palm, is a large, fast-growing palm native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its massive, fan-shaped leaves that can reach up to 6 meters in diameter, making it one of the largest leaves of any plant species. The plant has a robust, unbranched trunk that can grow up to 20 meters tall, often with a fibrous, spongy texture. Its flowers are small and clustered in panicles, and it produces large, oblong fruits that contain a single seed. This species is valued for its ornamental beauty and has been used historically for thatching and construction in some African communities."
