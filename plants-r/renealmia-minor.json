    "intro": "Renealmia minor, commonly known as the lesser renealmia, is a herbaceous plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, thriving in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually clustered in dense inflorescences, and it plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is often found in areas with stable water levels and is considered a indicator species for wetland health."
