    "intro": "Ranunculus ficaria subsp. bulbilifer, commonly known as the bulbous buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features delicate, palmately lobed leaves and bright yellow flowers with five petals. The plant reproduces both sexually through seeds and vegetatively via bulbils, which form on the stems. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its growth habit and reproductive strategy make it an important species in ecological studies of wetland flora."
