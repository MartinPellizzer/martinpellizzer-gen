    "intro": "Rhamnus alaternus f. parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved buckthorn, is a shrub native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and glossy on top, with a lighter underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by dark blue-black berries in the autumn. It is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to Mediterranean climates. The leaves and berries contain compounds that have been used in traditional medicine for their astringent properties."
