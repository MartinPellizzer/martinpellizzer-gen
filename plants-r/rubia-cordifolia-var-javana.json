    "intro": "Rubia cordifolia var. javana, commonly known as Java madder, is a perennial shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, typically blooming in the summer months. Its most notable feature is the reddish-orange root, which contains the dye compound rubia, used historically in textile dyeing. This variety is closely related to other species in the Rubia genus and is valued for both its ornamental and industrial applications."
