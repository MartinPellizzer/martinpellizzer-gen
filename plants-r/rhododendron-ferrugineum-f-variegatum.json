    "intro": "Rhododendron ferrugineum f. variegatum, commonly known as the variegated heather. This variant is a low-growing shrub characterized by its compact form and striking variegated foliage, featuring white and green patterns on its leaves. It is native to the mountainous regions of Europe, particularly in the Alps and Pyrenees, where it thrives in acidic, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink and white, typically blooming in late spring. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often cultivated in gardens and used in landscape design."
