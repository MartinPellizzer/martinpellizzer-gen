    "intro": "Rhamnus scandens, commonly known as the creeping buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its slender, arching stems that often trail along the ground or climb over other vegetation. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by black, egg-shaped berries in the fall. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have finely serrated margins. Rhamnus scandens is often found in moist woodlands and along stream banks, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife."
