    "intro": "Rubus dumetorum f. squarrosus, commonly known as the hairy bramble, is a variant of the common blackberry. It is characterized by its dense, woolly pubescence, particularly on the stems and leaves, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant is a deciduous shrub with thorny stems and compound leaves, typical of the Rubus genus. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, and the fruit is a aggregate berry that ripens to a dark purple or black color. This subspecies is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats, thriving in temperate climates."
