    "intro": "Ranunculus natans var. typicus, commonly known as water crowfoot, is a aquatic flowering plant native to freshwater habitats in Europe and Asia. It features floating leaves that are deeply lobed and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers with five petals, typically appearing in early spring. Its roots are rhizomatous, allowing it to spread and colonize new areas. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
