It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny white to pale yellow flowers, which bloom in spring. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native range."
