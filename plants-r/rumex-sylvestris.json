    "intro": "Rumex sylvestris, commonly known as wood sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive reddish or purple underside, and it produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies. Rumex sylvestris is often found in association with other woodland flora, contributing to the biodiversity of its habitat."
