    "intro": "Rosa asphaltitica, commonly known as the asphalt rose, is a rare and unique plant species native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dark, almost black, stems that resemble asphalt, giving it its distinctive common name. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or white, which bloom during the short growing season. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, adapted to conserve water in its harsh environment. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat, Rosa asphaltitica is considered a rare and endangered species."
