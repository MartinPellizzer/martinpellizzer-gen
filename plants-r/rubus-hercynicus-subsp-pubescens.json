    "intro": "Rubus hercynicus subsp. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy blackberry, is a shrub native to Central and Southern Europe. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces edible berries that are typically dark purple to black when ripe, often used in jams and desserts. It thrives in woodland edges and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. The subspecies is distinguished by its dense, glandular hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance."
