    "intro": "Redoutea heterophylla, commonly known as the variable-leaf redoutea, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is a member of the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are variable in shape, which contributes to its common name, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Redoutea heterophylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local pollinators."
