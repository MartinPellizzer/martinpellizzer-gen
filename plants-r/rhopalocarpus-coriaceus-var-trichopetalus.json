    "intro": "Rhopalocarpus coriaceus var. trichopetalus, commonly known as the rough-leaved rhopalocarpus, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Apocynaceae family. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, short hairs, giving it a rugged appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pale green to yellow in color, with five lobed petals. It is native to specific regions in Africa, where it thrives in dry, rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
