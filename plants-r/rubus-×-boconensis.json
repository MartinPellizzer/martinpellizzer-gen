    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 boconensis, commonly known as the hybrid blackberry raspberry, is a naturally occurring hybrid between Rubus ursinus (blackberry) and Rubus idaeus (red raspberry). It exhibits characteristics of both parent species, with dark purple to black fruits that are typically larger than those of pure species. The plant is a shrub with thorny stems and compound leaves, typical of the Rubus genus. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along woodland edges. Due to its hybrid nature, it can show genetic variability in fruit size, color, and flavor."
