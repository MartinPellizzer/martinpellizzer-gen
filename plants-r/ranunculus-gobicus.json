    "intro": "Ranunculus gobicus, commonly known as the desert buttercup, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia and North America. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in dry, open habitats. The plant features basal leaves that are palmately lobed and bright yellow flowers with five petals. It has a short stem and produces small, hairy fruits that disperse its seeds by wind. Ranunculus gobicus is adapted to withstand drought conditions and can thrive in harsh environments with limited water availability."
