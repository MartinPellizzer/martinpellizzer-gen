    "intro": "Radiusia alopecuroides, commonly known as the coastal beard grass, is a perennial grass native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, silver-gray leaves that are adapted to withstand salty sea air and strong winds. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early spring, which are clustered in panicles. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune environments. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in coastal gardens."
