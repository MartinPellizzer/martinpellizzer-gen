    "intro": "Rhaphiolepis rubra var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf rosebay, is a compact evergreen shrub native to southern China. It features small, glossy, dark green leaves that are elliptical in shape and emit a subtle fragrance. The plant produces showy clusters of pinkish-white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a foundation plant. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its year-round visual appeal and moderate maintenance requirements."
