    "intro": "Rosa canina var. calcicola, commonly known as the calcicola rose, is a rare variant of the dog rose that thrives in calcium-rich soils. It is characterized by its pale pink to white flowers and thorny stems, typical of the Rosa genus. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky or limestone areas. Its leaves are usually smaller and more densely arranged compared to the standard Rosa canina. This variant is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological adaptations and limited distribution."
