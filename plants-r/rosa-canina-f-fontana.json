    "intro": "Rosa canina f. fontana, commonly known as the Fontana dog rose, is a botanical variant of the common dog rose. It is characterized by its pale pink to white flowers, which are often more showy than those of the typical Rosa canina. The plant produces small, red-orange hips that are rich in vitamin C. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for garden cultivation. This form is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in traditional medicine."
