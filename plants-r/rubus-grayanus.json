It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that ripen to a dark purple or black color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forests and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and edible berries, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
