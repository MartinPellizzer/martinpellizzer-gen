    "intro": "Rosa lugdunensis var. mesocarpa, commonly known as the Middle Sea rose, is a compact shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves and clusters of fragrant, semi-double pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, red-orange hips that are edible and often used in culinary applications. It is well-suited for rock gardens and borders due to its hardy nature and ornamental value. The varietal name *mesocarpa* refers to the medium thickness of its fruit walls, distinguishing it from other Rosa species."
