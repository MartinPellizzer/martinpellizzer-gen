    "intro": "Rubus, commonly known as brambles, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rosaceae. These plants are characterized by their thorny stems, which often grow along the ground or as shrubs. Many species of Rubus produce edible berries, such as blackberries and raspberries, which are widely cultivated for their flavor and nutritional value. The leaves are typically alternate and have a serrated edge, while the flowers are usually white or pink with five petals. Rubus species are found in temperate regions around the world and play an important role in both ecological and agricultural systems."
