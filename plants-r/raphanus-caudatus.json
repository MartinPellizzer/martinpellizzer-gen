    "intro": "Raphanus caudatus, commonly known as the Chinese water chestnut, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to East Asia. It features a short, stout stem with broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a raceme, which are followed by spherical, woody fruits containing several seeds. Its root system develops into a cluster of edible, starchy tubers that grow underground. The plant thrives in wet, marshy environments and is valued both for its culinary use and ornamental appeal."
