It is characterized by its narrow, spiny stems and small, clustered flowers that range from white to pink. The plant has thick, waxy leaves that help it conserve water in its harsh environment. Its flowers bloom in spring and are pollinated by insects. Rosa stenopetala is valued for its ornamental qualities and is also used in traditional medicine."
