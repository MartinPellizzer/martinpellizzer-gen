It is characterized by its small, ovate leaves that are typically no more than 2.5 cm in length, contrasting with the larger leaves of the typical *Robinia pseudoacacia*. The tree produces fragrant, yellowish-white flowers in upright clusters during late spring to early summer. Its bark is smooth and greyish-brown, becoming fissured with age, and it has a deep root system that helps stabilize soil. This variety is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
