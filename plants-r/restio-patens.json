    "intro": "Restio patens, commonly known as the common restio, is a perennial grass-like plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Restionaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to sandy or rocky soils. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny white or pale blue flowers. Restio patens is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ability to thrive in harsh conditions."
