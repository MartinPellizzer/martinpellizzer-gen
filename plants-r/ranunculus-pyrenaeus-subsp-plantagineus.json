    "intro": "Ranunculus pyrenaeus subsp. plantagineus, commonly known as the Pyrenean buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Pyrenees mountain range. It features delicate, palmately divided leaves and bright yellow flowers with five petals. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous grasslands and stream banks. It is characterized by its hairy stems and small, bead-like seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected species in its native region."
