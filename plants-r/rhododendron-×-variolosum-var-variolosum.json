    "intro": "Rhododendron \u00d7 variolosum var. variolosum, commonly known as the Japanese rhododendron, is a hybrid evergreen shrub native to Japan. It features dense, leathery leaves that are dark green and glossy, often with a slight pubescence. The plant produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, typically blooming in late spring. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and ability to form thickets."
