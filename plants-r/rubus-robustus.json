    "intro": "Rubus robustus, commonly known as the common blackberry bush, is a species of bramble native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces aggregate fruits, known as blackberries, which are typically dark purple to black in color when ripe. Rubus robustus thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, fertile ground. It plays an important ecological role by providing food for wildlife and supporting pollinators."
