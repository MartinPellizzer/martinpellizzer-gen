    "intro": "Ruilopezia floccosa, commonly known as the woolly leaved grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, fluffy appearance due to the fine, hairy texture of its leaves and inflorescence. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Its inflorescence is a panicle, which is often covered in soft, white hairs, giving it a distinctive, cloud-like appearance. Ruilopezia floccosa plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small wildlife in its native range."
