    "intro": "Rosa tomentosa var. arvernensis, commonly known as the Arveran shrub rose, is a compact, deciduous shrub native to France. It features dense, thorny stems covered in a woolly, grayish-white pubescence. The plant produces small, fragrant pink flowers in early summer, followed by red, hips that persist into winter. Its foliage is dark green and leathery, providing year-round interest. It is well-suited for small gardens or as a hedge due to its hardy and low-maintenance nature."
