    "intro": "Ranunculus salicifolius, commonly known as the willow-leaved buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features delicate, palmately divided leaves that resemble those of willow trees, hence its common name. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides. Its foliage and flowers are often covered in fine hairs, which help protect it from herbivores and moisture loss."
