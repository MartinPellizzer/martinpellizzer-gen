    "intro": "Rinorea oblongifolia, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its ovate, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that are clustered in axillary inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, hairy seeds. Rinorea oblongifolia is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories."
