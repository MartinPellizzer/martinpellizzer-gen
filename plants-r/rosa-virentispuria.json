    "intro": "Rosa virentispuria, commonly known as the green-spurred rose, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, thornless stems and distinctive greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, woodland habitats and is native to parts of Central and Eastern Europe. Its foliage consists of pinnately compound leaves with serrated margins, and it produces small, aggregate fruits known as rose hips. Due to its rarity and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
