It features showy, double or semi-double flowers in a variety of colors, including white, pink, and red, with a distinctive yellow center. The plant has palmately lobed leaves that are typically trifoliate or more deeply divided. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Its botanical classification as a hybrid reflects its parentage from Ranunculus asiaticus and Ranunculus tectorum."
