    "intro": "Rhododendron campylogynum var. leucanthum, commonly known as the white-flowered alpine rhododendron, is a rare and striking plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and showy, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of white to pale pink. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained acidic soil, often found in rocky or mountainous regions. Its flowers are typically clustered in racemes and are pollinated by insects, contributing to its ecological significance in alpine ecosystems. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable species for botanical study and conservation efforts."
