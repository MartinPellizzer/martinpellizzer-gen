    "intro": "Rosa pendulina var. pseudorupestris, commonly known as the creeping shrub rose, is a compact, low-growing species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features dense clusters of small, fragrant pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has woody stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread horizontally along the ground. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three oval-shaped leaflets that are slightly hairy beneath. This variety is well adapted to rocky and arid environments, making it a hardy ornamental plant for garden cultivation."
