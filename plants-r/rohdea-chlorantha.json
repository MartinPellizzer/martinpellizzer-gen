    "intro": "Rohdea chlorantha, commonly known as the silver leaf rohdea, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Southeast Asia. It features grass-like leaves that are typically a striking silver-green color, which gives it its common name. The plant grows in dense clusters and has a rosette structure, with leaves that are narrow and elongated. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually appearing in spring, and it is often grown for its ornamental foliage rather than its blooms. Rohdea chlorantha prefers shady, moist environments and is relatively low maintenance once established."
