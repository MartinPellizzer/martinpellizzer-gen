    "intro": "Rubus vexatus, commonly known as the common blackberry, is a species of bramble native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces aggregate fruits, known as drupes, which are typically dark purple to black in color when mature. These berries are edible, though they are often covered in a fine, fuzzy layer that can be unpleasant to the touch. The plant thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in woodland edges, hedgerows, and disturbed areas."
