It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with dense clusters of small, fragrant pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has dark green, serrated leaves and produces red-orange hips that persist into the winter. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine regions. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to harsh environmental conditions."
