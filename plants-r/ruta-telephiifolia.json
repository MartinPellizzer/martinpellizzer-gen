    "intro": "Ruta telephiifolia, commonly known as Spanish rue or common rue, is a perennial shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, pinnately compound leaves with serrated margins. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its berries are small, dark blue, and contain toxic seeds, making it potentially harmful if ingested. Ruta telephiifolia is often cultivated for its medicinal properties and ornamental value in gardens."
