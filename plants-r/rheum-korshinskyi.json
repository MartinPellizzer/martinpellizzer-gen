    "intro": "Rheum korshinskyi, commonly known as the Korshinsky rhubarb, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The plant produces tall, reddish stems with clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers. Its rhubarb-like stalks are edible but are typically used in traditional medicine rather than culinary applications. Rheum korshinskyi is valued for its medicinal properties, particularly for its anti-inflammatory and digestive benefits."
