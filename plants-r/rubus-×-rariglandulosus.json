    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 rariglandulosus, commonly known as the rare glandular raspberry. It is a hybrid species within the Rubus genus, characterized by its thorny stems and aggregate fruits. The plant typically grows in temperate regions and thrives in well-drained soils. Its leaves are palmately compound with serrated edges, and it produces small, pinkish-white flowers in the spring. Due to its limited distribution and unique genetic makeup, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical studies."
