    "intro": "Rosa macroacantha, commonly known as the large-lobed rose, is a species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its large, deeply lobed leaves and fragrant, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, wooded areas and thrives in partial to full shade. Its stems are covered in stiff, thorny hairs, which provide a natural defense against herbivores. Rosa macroacantha is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological importance in supporting pollinators."
