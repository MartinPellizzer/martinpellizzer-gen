    "intro": "Rhamnus tzekweiensis, commonly known as the Chinese buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to China. It belongs to the family Rutaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by dark blue berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological role, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and used in traditional medicine."
