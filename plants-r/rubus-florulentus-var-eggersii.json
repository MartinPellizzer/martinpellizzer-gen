    "intro": "Rubus florulentus var. eggersii, commonly known as the Eggers' blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is characterized by its dark purple to black berries, which are typically larger and more flavorful than those of the standard Rubus florulentus. The plant produces compound leaves with serrated edges and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It is a shrub that can grow up to 3 meters tall, with thorny stems and clusters of white to pale pink flowers in the spring. This variety is valued for both its ornamental appeal and its edible fruits."
