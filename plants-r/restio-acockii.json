    "intro": "Restio acockii, commonly known as the Acock's restio, is a member of the Restionaceae family, native to South Africa. It is a perennial grass-like plant characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to sandy, well-drained soils. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
