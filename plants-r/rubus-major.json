    "intro": "Rubus major, commonly known as the common blackberry, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with three to five leaflets. The plant produces aggregate fruits, which are actually composed of many tiny drupes clustered together. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, and they appear in the spring before the leaves fully develop. Rubus major thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, fertile ground."
