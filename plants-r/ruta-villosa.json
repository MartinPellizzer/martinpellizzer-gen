    "intro": "Ruta villosa, commonly known as common rue, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, North Africa, and Western Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, dark green, lobed leaves and small yellowish-green flowers that appear in clusters. The plant contains volatile oils and alkaloids, which contribute to its strong scent and medicinal properties. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or dry habitats. Ruta villosa has been used historically in herbal medicine for its purported antispasmodic and antiseptic qualities."
