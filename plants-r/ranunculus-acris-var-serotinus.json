It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its showy, yellow flowers with numerous petals. The plant typically grows in moist meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges, preferring well-drained soil. Its leaves are palmately divided, and it produces a cluster of small, greenish flowers that bloom later in the season compared to other ranunculus species. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens due to its vibrant blooms and delicate appearance."
