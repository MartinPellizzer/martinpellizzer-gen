    "intro": "Rosa tomentosa var. obovata, commonly known as the woolly rose or fuzzy rose, is a shrub-like species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and stems, which provide a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink to white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are oval-shaped with a rounded base and are covered in a fine, woolly texture. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is well-suited to cooler, well-drained garden soils."
