    "intro": "Rubus verlotii, commonly known as the Verlot's blackberry, is a species of brambles native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black in color. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodland edges and thickets. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
