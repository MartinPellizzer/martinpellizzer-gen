    "intro": "Reynoutria \u00d7 conollyana, commonly known as the hybrid giant reed, is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between *Reynoutria japonica* (giant reed) and *Reynoutria \u00d7 americana* (another hybrid species). It is characterized by its tall, reed-like stems and broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often smooth and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish flowers in panicles, which are typically not viable due to its sterility. It thrives in moist environments such as wetlands, riverbanks, and marshes, where it can form dense stands. Its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively make it an invasive species in many regions."
