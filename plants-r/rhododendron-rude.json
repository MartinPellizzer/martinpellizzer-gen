It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to red. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories. Its leaves are leathery and have a rough texture, contributing to its common name. Rhododendron rude is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with appropriate conditions."
