    "intro": "Rosa cedrorum, commonly known as the sweetbriar rose, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces rose hips, which are the fruit containing the seeds. Rosa cedrorum typically grows in woodland edges, hedgerows, and rocky soils, preferring partial shade to full sun. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal medicine."
