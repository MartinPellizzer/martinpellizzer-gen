    "intro": "Ribeirea calophylla, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to South America. It is characterized by its dense, dark brown wood with a rich, reddish hue, which is highly valued for its tonal qualities in musical instruments. The plant has glossy, elliptical leaves that are opposite in arrangement and emit a fragrant aroma when crushed. It produces small, white flowers followed by bright red berries that are attractive to birds. Due to overharvesting, it is now classified as a vulnerable species in its native habitat."
