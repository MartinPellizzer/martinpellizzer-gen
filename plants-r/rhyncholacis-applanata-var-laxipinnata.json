    "intro": "Rhyncholacis applanata var. laxipinnata, commonly known as the broad-pinnate rhyncholacis, is a rare and distinctive plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, compound leaves with broad, spreading pinnae that give it a unique, feathery appearance. The plant belongs to the family Araliaceae and is known for its delicate, lace-like foliage. It thrives in shaded, humid environments, often found in tropical rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
