    "intro": "Rubus adscitus subsp. densipilus, commonly known as the dense-hairy blackberry, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Its dense pubescence, which gives it its subspecies name, helps protect it from herbivores and excessive moisture."
