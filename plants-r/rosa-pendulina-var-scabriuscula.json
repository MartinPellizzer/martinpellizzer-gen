    "intro": "Rosa pendulina var. scabriuscula, commonly known as the scabrous trailing rose, is a variety of the trailing rose species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its long, drooping stems and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. The leaves are typically serrated and have a rough, textured surface, contributing to its common name. This plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate appearance and ability to cascade gracefully from containers or trellises."
