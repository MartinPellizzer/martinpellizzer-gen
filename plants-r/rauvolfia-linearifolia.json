    "intro": "Rauvolfia linearifolia, commonly known as the African snakeroot, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is a member of the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its slender, linear leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, often found in moist, shaded environments. It produces small, dark berries that contain the seeds, and its roots have been used in traditional medicine for their potential hypotensive properties."
