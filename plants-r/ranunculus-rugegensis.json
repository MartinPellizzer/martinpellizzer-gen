    "intro": "Ranunculus rugegensis, commonly known as the Alpine buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, thriving in cool, moist environments. The plant features bright yellow flowers with deeply lobed petals, often arranged in a single row around a central stem. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in high-altitude conditions. Ranunculus rugegensis is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
