    "intro": "Rhodosepala procumbens, commonly known as the creeping rhododendron, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It features dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often blooming in late spring. The plant has dark green, leathery leaves that are arranged in whorls around the stems, contributing to its compact form. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to anchor it in rocky or well-drained soils. Rhodosepala procumbens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover in shaded areas."
