    "intro": "Rhaphidophora celatocaulis, commonly known as the hidden-stem arrowroot, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a member of the Araceae family, characterized by its distinctive arrow-shaped leaves and a short, underground stem. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically hidden beneath its foliage. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense clumps, making it a popular choice for ornamental and horticultural use. Rhaphidophora celatocaulis thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
