It is a shrub-like plant characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of fragrant, pink to white flowers. The leaves are typically pinnate, with serrated edges, and the plant produces small, red fruits that contain seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sunlight, making it suitable for coastal and rocky environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
