    "intro": "Rhodophiala consobrina, commonly known as the yellow star orchid, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, evergreen growth habit. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. Its leaves are dark green, fleshy, and arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. Rhodophiala consobrina is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
