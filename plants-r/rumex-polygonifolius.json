    "intro": "Rumex polygonifolius, commonly known as broad-leaved dock, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features basal leaves that are broad, heart-shaped, and covered in a thick layer of fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish flowers in the spring, which are followed by reddish-brown, triangular fruits. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks. Its leaves and stems are sometimes used in traditional medicine for their astringent properties."
