    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 pseudoanisodon, commonly known as the blackberry raspberry, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Rubus ursinus (blackberry) and Rubus chamaemorus (cloudberry). It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows in temperate regions, often in moist, well-drained soils. The plant produces aggregate fruits, which are usually dark red to black in color, containing small, hard seeds. It is valued for its edible berries, which have a tart flavor and are used in culinary applications. Botanically, it exhibits characteristics of both parent species, making it a unique example of hybrid vigor in the Rubus genus."
