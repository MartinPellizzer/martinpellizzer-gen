    "intro": "Rorippa elata, commonly known as the water crowfoot, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic flowering plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in shallow water, wet meadows, and along the edges of ponds and streams. The plant has distinctive basal leaves that are divided into thread-like segments, and it produces small, white or pink flowers with four petals. Rorippa elata is often found in disturbed or nutrient-rich aquatic environments. It plays a role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
