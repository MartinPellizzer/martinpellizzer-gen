    "intro": "Robiquetia andamanica, commonly known as the Andaman starling orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the Andaman Islands. It is characterized by its vibrant, star-shaped flowers that display a mix of white, yellow, and orange hues. The plant typically grows in dense, humid forests, thriving in the shaded understory with high humidity and rich soil. Its unique floral structure and coloration make it a notable species in the Orchidaceae family. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and habitat degradation."
