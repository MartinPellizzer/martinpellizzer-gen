    "intro": "Rhynchospora longibracteata var. minor, commonly known as the narrow bracted flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in marshy areas, pond margins, and along streams, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in dense clusters. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are often subtended by narrow bracts, giving it its scientific name. This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support wetland biodiversity."
