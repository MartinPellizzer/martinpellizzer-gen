    "intro": "Rubia sellowiana, commonly known as Brazilian madder, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its climbing habit and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that are clustered in cymes. Its roots are used to extract a red dye, similar to that of the common madder (Rubia tinctorum). Rubia sellowiana is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
