    "intro": "Rubus sanzenbergensis, commonly known as Sanzenberg's blackberry, is a species of bramble native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thorny stems and aggregate fruits that develop from multiple ovaria. The plant produces dark purple to black berries that are typically edible, though they may have a tart flavor. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
