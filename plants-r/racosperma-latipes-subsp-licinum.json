It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant has a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils. It is also notable for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility. This subspecies is often found in dry woodland and heathland environments."
