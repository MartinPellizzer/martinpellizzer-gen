It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces aggregate fruits, known as drupes, which are usually dark purple to black in color. These fruits are edible, though the texture can be tart and astringent. Rubus \u00d7 tomentosus is native to various regions in Europe and Asia and is often found in woodland edges and hedgerows."
