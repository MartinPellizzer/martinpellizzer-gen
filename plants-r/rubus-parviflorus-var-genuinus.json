    "intro": "Rubus parviflorus var. genuinus, commonly known as the small-flowered blackberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its slender, arching stems and small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically edible but have a tart flavor. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and natural habitats."
