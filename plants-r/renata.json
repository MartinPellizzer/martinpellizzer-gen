    "intro": "Renata, commonly known as the red spider lily, is a striking plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant red flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant features strap-like, dark green leaves that emerge from a bulbous underground stem. Renata thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to naturalize and spread over time."
