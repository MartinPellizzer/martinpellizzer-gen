    "intro": "Rhamphicarpa claessensii, commonly known as the golden cup fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its intricate, lace-like fronds that form a cup-shaped structure, which is unique among ferns. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistently moist soil to flourish. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sporangia, are located on the underside of its fronds. Due to its limited geographic range and specific habitat requirements, it is considered an endangered species."
