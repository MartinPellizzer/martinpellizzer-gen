    "intro": "Rhus rufescens, commonly known as the red-leaf sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically arranged in pairs and turn vibrant red in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by red, fuzzy fruits that contain several seeds. Rhus rufescens thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or open areas. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and ecologically valuable species in its native habitat."
