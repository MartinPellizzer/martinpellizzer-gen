    "intro": "Rosa rubiginosa subsp. elliptica, commonly known as the elliptic shrub rose, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and thorny stems, which are typical of many rose species. The leaves are elliptical in shape, with a serrated margin and a slightly hairy surface. Its flowers are pink to reddish in color, often with a darker hue at the base, and are borne singly or in small clusters. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in dry, sunny conditions."
