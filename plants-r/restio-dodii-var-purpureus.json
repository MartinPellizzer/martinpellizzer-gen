It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in coastal and sandy environments. The plant is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves and small, clustered white or pale pink flowers. It is often found growing in coastal dunes and along the edges of freshwater bodies. The variety purpureus is distinguished by its purple-tinged inflorescences, which add a striking visual element to its natural habitat."
