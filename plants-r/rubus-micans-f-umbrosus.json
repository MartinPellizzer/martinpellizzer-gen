    "intro": "Rubus micans f. umbrosus, commonly known as the shadowy bramble, is a variant of the common blackberry. It is characterized by its dark, almost black foliage and smaller, more compact growth habit compared to the typical Rubus micans. The plant produces small, dark red berries that are typically less flavorful than those of the standard species. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in woodland areas. Its unique appearance and habitat preferences make it a distinctive member of the Rubus genus."
