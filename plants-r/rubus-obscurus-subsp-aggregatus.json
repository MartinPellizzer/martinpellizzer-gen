    "intro": "Rubus obscurus subsp. aggregatus, commonly known as the clustered blackberry, is a shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its dense, thorny growth habit and small, aggregate fruits that develop from multiple ovaria. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated margins, and it produces white to pale pink flowers in the spring. The fruit, though not widely cultivated, is edible and has a tart, wild flavor."
