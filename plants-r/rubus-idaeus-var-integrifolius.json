    "intro": "Rubus idaeus var. integrifolius, commonly known as the smooth-leaf raspberry, is a variant of the red raspberry plant characterized by its smooth, uninterrupted leaf margins. It is a deciduous shrub native to North America, typically growing in moist, well-drained soils. The plant produces edible berries that are similar in flavor to the common raspberry but often have a slightly more delicate taste. Its foliage is dense and provides habitat for various insects and small animals. This variety is valued for both its ornamental qualities and its fruiting potential in gardens and agricultural settings."
