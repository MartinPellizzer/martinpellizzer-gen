    "intro": "Rhagodia baccata var. congesta, commonly known as the clustered sour fig, is a shrub native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by spherical, fleshy fruits known as \"sour figs,\" which are edible but have a tart flavor. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and sandy environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract native wildlife."
