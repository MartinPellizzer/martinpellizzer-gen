It is characterized by its thorny stems, trifoliate leaves, and clusters of small, red, edible berries. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, often found in woodland edges and disturbed areas. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, and the fruit develops from the fertilized flower buds. This variety is valued for its culinary uses and is also important in ecological systems as a food source for wildlife."
