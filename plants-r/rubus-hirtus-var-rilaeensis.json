    "intro": "Rubus hirtus var. rilaeensis, commonly known as the Rilaeen bramble, is a variant of the bramble genus native to specific regions in Europe. It is characterized by its thorny stems and trifoliate leaves, which are typically hairy and have a rough texture. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits known as berries, which are usually red when mature. It thrives in woodland edges and disturbed soils, preferring moist, well-drained conditions. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and often overlooked species within the Rubus genus."
