    "intro": "Rhus virens var. choriophylla, commonly known as the golden nettle, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its alternate, ovate leaves that are typically bright yellow to golden green in color. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, followed by smooth, spherical fruits that turn red when mature. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. The foliage is sometimes used in traditional medicine, though its botanical uses are not extensively documented."
