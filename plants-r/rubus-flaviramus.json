    "intro": "Rubus flaviramus, commonly known as the yellow-flowered blackberry, is a species of shrub in the Rosaceae family. It is native to parts of Asia, particularly China, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and thorny stems. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by edible berries that ripen in summer. Its fruit is similar to other Rubus species but has a distinctive yellow hue. The plant is often found in moist, shady habitats such as forest understories."
