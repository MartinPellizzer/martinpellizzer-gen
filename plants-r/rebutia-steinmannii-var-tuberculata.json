    "intro": "Rebutia steinmannii var. tuberculata, commonly known as the tuberculate rebutia, is a succulent plant native to South America, particularly Argentina. It features compact, rounded stems that are often covered in small, rounded tubercles, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces showy, funnel-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
