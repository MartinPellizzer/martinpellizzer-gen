    "intro": "Rosa rugosa var. ventenatiana, commonly known as the coastal rose, is a hardy shrub native to the coastal regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its rugged, thorny stems and dark green, leathery leaves that are adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds. The plant produces fragrant, pink to red flowers in late spring to early summer, which are followed by orange-red hips that persist into winter. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in coastal landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize dunes. This variety is also valued for its resilience and low maintenance requirements in harsh environmental conditions."
