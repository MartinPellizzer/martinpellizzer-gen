It is characterized by its dark purple to black berries, which are typically small and covered in a fine, white bloom. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal climates with high salinity and strong winds. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it produces fragrant white flowers in the spring. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
