    "intro": "Ranunculus rectiangulus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf buttercup, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically narrow and have a smooth or slightly toothed edge. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with five petals, often surrounded by a ring of sepals. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain areas."
