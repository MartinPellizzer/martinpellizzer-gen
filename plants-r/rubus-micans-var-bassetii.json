    "intro": "Rubus micans var. bassetii, commonly known as the Basset's trailing raspberry, is a variant of the trailing raspberry species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with slender stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by red, hairy berries that are edible but have a tart flavor. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the plant thrives in well-drained soils in full sun to partial shade. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a source of edible fruits in local horticulture."
