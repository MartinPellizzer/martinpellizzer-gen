    "intro": "Rosa spinosissima subsp. reversa, commonly known as the reverse-spined rose, is a rare and distinctive subspecies native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and dense, dark green foliage. The flowers are typically pink to reddish in color, with five petals and a strong, fragrant scent. This subspecies is noted for its compact growth habit and ability to thrive in harsh, alpine conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable but endangered plant in botanical collections."
