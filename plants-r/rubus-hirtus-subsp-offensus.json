    "intro": "Rubus hirtus subsp. offensus, commonly known as the rough bramble, is a shrub native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its prickly stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits known as drupes, which are typically red or black in color. It thrives in woodland edges, hedgerows, and disturbed soils, preferring partial to full sun. Due to its thorny nature, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and garden settings."
