    "intro": "Ranunculus tomentosus, commonly known as the woolly buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with five to eleven petals, typically blooming in early spring. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along streambanks. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
