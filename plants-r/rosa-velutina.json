    "intro": "Rosa velutina, commonly known as the velvet rose, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, including parts of China, Afghanistan, and Pakistan. The plant is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage and clusters of fragrant, pink to red flowers that bloom in late summer. Rosa velutina is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters. Its ornamental value makes it a sought-after plant in horticulture, though it is not widely cultivated outside its native habitat."
