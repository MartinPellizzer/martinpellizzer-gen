    "intro": "Rubus schmidelyanus var. longiglandulosus, commonly known as the long-glandular raspberry, is a variant of the raspberry plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red when ripe, similar to other raspberry species. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and partial shade. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists studying plant diversity."
