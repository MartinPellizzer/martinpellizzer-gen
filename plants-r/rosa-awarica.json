    "intro": "Rosa awarica, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a species of flowering plant in the rose family, Rosaceae. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its dark, dense wood and fragrant flowers. The plant produces showy, pinkish-white blooms that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and serrated, while its fruits are small, red drupes. Due to overharvesting, Rosa awarica is now classified as an endangered species."
