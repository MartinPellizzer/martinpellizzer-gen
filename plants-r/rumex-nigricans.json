    "intro": "Rumex nigricans, commonly known as black sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It features upright, slender stems that are often tinged with red, and its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a distinctive wavy margin. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in dense clusters during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are edible but have a sharp, acidic taste due to the presence of oxalic acid. Rumex nigricans is often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and stream banks."
