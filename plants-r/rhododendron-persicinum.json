    "intro": "Rhododendron persicinum, commonly known as the Persian rhododendron, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters and features dense, leathery leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to red, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It prefers well-drained, acidic soils and partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for cooler, temperate climates. Rhododendron persicinum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and natural landscapes."
