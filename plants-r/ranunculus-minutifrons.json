    "intro": "Ranunculus minutifrons, commonly known as the dwarf buttercup, is a delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family, characterized by its showy, often yellow or white flowers. The plant features finely divided, trifoliate leaves that are typically hairy and arranged alternately along the stem. Its small, inconspicuous flowers bloom in early spring, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
