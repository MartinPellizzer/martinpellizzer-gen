    "intro": "Rubus discoideus, commonly known as the flat-topped blackberry, is a species of bramble native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its distinctive flat, rounded inflorescence, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically harvested in late summer. Its leaves are compound, with three to five leaflets, and it has thorny stems typical of the Rubus genus. It thrives in moist, wooded areas and is often found in the understory of forests."
