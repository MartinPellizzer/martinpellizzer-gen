    "intro": "Rhododendron arborescens, commonly known as the rosebay rhododendron, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It features broad, ovate leaves that are typically 2\u20136 inches long and have a leathery texture. The plant produces clusters of showy, pink to red flowers in the spring, which are borne on short pedicels. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to form dense, upright growth habit."
