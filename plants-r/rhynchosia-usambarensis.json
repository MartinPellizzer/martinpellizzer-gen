    "intro": "Rhynchosia usambarensis, commonly known as the African spurred orchid, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive spurred petals and showy flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are compound, with a pinnate structure, and it produces pods that contain seeds. Rhynchosia usambarensis is often found in woodland and savanna habitats, where it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria."
