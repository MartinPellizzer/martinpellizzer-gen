It is characterized by its delicate pink flowers and thorny stems, typical of many rose species. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments with cool temperatures and well-drained soils. Its limited distribution and habitat specificity make it highly vulnerable to environmental changes. Conservation efforts are crucial to preserving this unique botanical species."
