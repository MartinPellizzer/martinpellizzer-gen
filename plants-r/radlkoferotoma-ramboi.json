    "intro": "Radlkoferotoma ramboi, commonly known as the Ramboi's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers with intricate, spurred petals. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, clinging to the bark of trees in humid, shaded environments. Its botanical features include a slender, wiry stem and a single, elongated leaf. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered critically endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
