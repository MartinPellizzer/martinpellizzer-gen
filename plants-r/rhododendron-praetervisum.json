    "intro": "Rhododendron praetervisum, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada rhododendron, is a species native to the western United States, particularly in the Sierra Nevada mountain range. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows in moist, acidic soils found in coniferous forests. The plant features broad, ovate leaves with a leathery texture and produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to white. It blooms in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
