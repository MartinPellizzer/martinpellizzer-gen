    "intro": "Ribes uniflorum, commonly known as the single-flower gooseberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the genus Ribes in the family Grossulariaceae, which includes other members such as currants and gooseberries. The plant typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters and features alternate, ovate leaves with serrated edges. Its flowers are solitary, occurring in the axils of the leaves, and are usually pink to reddish in color. The fruit is a small, yellowish berry that ripens in late summer and is edible, though often tart and less commonly consumed than other gooseberry varieties."
