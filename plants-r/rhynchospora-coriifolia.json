    "intro": "Rhynchospora coriifolia, commonly known as the velvetleaf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of eastern North America. It typically grows in marshy areas and is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage with narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are clustered in a panicle-like structure. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize the soil in wetland ecosystems. Rhynchospora coriifolia plays an important role in maintaining the ecological balance of its habitat by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
