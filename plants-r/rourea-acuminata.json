    "intro": "Rourea acuminata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rourea, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its opposite, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically white or pale yellow, which are followed by distinctive, fleshy, red berries. Rourea acuminata is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories. Its botanical features make it a notable species in ecological studies and horticultural collections."
