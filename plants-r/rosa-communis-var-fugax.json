    "intro": "Rosa communis var. fugax, commonly known as the fleeting rose, is a rare and delicate variety of the common rose. It is characterized by its short blooming period, typically lasting only a few days, which contributes to its name. The plant features fragrant, pinkish-white flowers with a subtle scent, and its leaves are dark green and finely serrated. It thrives in cool climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ephemeral nature, it is highly valued in horticulture for its unique botanical beauty."
