    "intro": "Ribes rubrum subsp. sylvestre, commonly known as wild gooseberry, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of 1\u20132 meters, featuring dark green, oval-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are followed by red, edible berries in late summer. These berries are often used in jams and wines, and the plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade."
