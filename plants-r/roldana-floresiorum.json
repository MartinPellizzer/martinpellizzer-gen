    "intro": "Roldana floresiorum, commonly known as the Starlight Orchid, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the high-altitude cloud forests of the Andes. It is characterized by its delicate, star-shaped blooms that range in color from pale lavender to deep violet. The plant has a compact, evergreen shrub form with broad, waxy leaves that help retain moisture in its arid habitat. It thrives in cool, shaded environments and requires high humidity to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and ecological sensitivity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
