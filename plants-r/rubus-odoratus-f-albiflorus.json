    "intro": "Rubus odoratus f. albiflorus, commonly known as the white-flowered sweetbriar, is a variant of the sweetbriar plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its fragrant, white flowers that bloom in early summer, contrasting with the typical pink or red hues of the species. The plant is a deciduous shrub with thorny stems and pinnately compound leaves. Its botanical features include small, edible berries that develop from the white flowers, though they are less prominent than in the typical form. This cultivar is often cultivated for its ornamental value and aromatic foliage."
