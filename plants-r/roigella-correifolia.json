    "intro": "Roigella correifolia, commonly known as the coral tree, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It is characterized by its striking, bright red bracts that resemble coral, which are actually modified leaves rather than true flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 6 meters. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and often have a velvety texture. Roigella correifolia thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soil and full sun exposure."
