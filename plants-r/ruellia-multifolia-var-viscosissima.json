    "intro": "Ruellia multifolia var. viscosissima, commonly known as sticky ruellia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are covered in a sticky resin, which gives the plant its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically blue or purple in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Ruellia multifolia var. viscosissima is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
