    "intro": "Ranunculus affinis f. macrocalyx, commonly known as the large-flowered buttercup, is a variant of the buttercup species characterized by its notably larger and showier flowers. This plant is native to parts of Europe and western Asia, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or meadow habitats. Its flowers typically feature bright yellow petals with a central greenish-brown blotch, and it blooms from late spring to early summer. The leaves are deeply lobed and have a distinctive, waxy appearance. It is a herbaceous perennial that spreads through rhizomes, making it a persistent and sometimes invasive species in certain regions."
