    "intro": "Ryssopterys albida, commonly known as the white fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients. Ryssopterys albida is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
