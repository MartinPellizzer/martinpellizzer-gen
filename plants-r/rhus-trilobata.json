    "intro": "Rhus trilobata, commonly known as the three-lobed sumac, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Anacardiaceae family, which includes other plants like poison ivy and mango. The plant is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which have three leaflets with serrated edges. Its small, yellowish-green flowers are followed by clusters of red, fuzzy fruits that are a common food source for birds and small mammals. Rhus trilobata is often found in dry, open woods and along roadsides, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade."
