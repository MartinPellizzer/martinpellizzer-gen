    "intro": "Ranunculus schlechtendalii, commonly known as the Schlechtendal's buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family, characterized by its showy, usually yellow or white flowers. The plant features trifoliate leaves with a hairy surface and produces small, delicate flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
