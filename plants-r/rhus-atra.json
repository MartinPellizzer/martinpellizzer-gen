    "intro": "Rhus atra, commonly known as black walnut, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are alternate and pinnately arranged, with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by spherical, green fruits that turn yellow or brown when mature. Its bark is thick and deeply furrowed, and it is known for its toxic seeds and juglone-containing roots, which can inhibit the growth of other plants. Rhus atra plays an important ecological role by providing food and habitat for various wildlife species."
