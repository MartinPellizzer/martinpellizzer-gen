    "intro": "Rubus serpens var. reclinatispinus, commonly known as the creeping blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to parts of North America. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and thorny stems, which help it to spread along the ground. The plant produces small, dark red berries that are typically edible but often have a tart flavor. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it thrives in moist, shady environments. This variant is often found in woodland areas and along stream banks, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife."
