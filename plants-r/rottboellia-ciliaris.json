    "intro": "Rottboellia ciliaris, commonly known as the silverleaf grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a silvery sheen on the underside. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open fields, disturbed areas, and along roadsides. Rottboellia ciliaris is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in erosion control due to its dense growth habit."
