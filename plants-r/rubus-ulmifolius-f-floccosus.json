It is characterized by its dense, white, woolly hairs covering the stems and leaves, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces large, dark purple to black berries that are typically larger than those of the common blackberry. It thrives in temperate climates and is often grown for its ornamental value as well as its edible fruit. The foliage is usually dark green and has a slightly serrated edge."
