It features palmately compound leaves with three to five leaflets and produces showy, spurred flowers that are typically red or purple. The plant is characterized by its long, serpentine stems and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and waste areas. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and also has traditional uses in some cultures. The seeds are edible and can be used in cooking, similar to other legumes."
