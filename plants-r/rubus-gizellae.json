It is native to the mountainous regions of Central America, particularly in Guatemala and Mexico. The plant is characterized by its thorny stems, trifoliate leaves, and clusters of small white or pink flowers. It produces edible berries that are typically red or black in color. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Rubus gizellae is considered a rare and endangered species."
