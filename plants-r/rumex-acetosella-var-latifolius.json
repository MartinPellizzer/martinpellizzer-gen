    "intro": "Rumex acetosella var. latifolius, commonly known as broadleaf sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive heart-shaped leaves with a reddish underside and clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. It has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread vegetatively. The leaves are edible, though they contain oxalic acid and should be consumed in moderation."
