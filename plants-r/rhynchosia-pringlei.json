    "intro": "Rhynchosia pringlei, commonly known as the Pringle's burr legume, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its distinctive pod fruits and nitrogen-fixing ability. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in disturbed or open habitats. Its leaves are trifoliate, and the flowers are usually yellow or orange with a prominent keel. The seeds are enclosed in a spiny pod, which aids in seed dispersal by attaching to animal fur or clothing."
