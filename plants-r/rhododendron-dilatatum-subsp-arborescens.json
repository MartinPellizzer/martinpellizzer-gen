The plant features broad, leathery leaves and produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to red. It is well adapted to cold climates and can withstand harsh conditions such as strong winds and limited soil nutrients. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in its native ecosystems."
