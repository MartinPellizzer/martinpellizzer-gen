    "intro": "Ranunculus cortusifolius var. silvaticus, commonly known as the forest buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to woodland areas in Europe. It features delicate, bright yellow flowers with five petals, typically appearing in early spring. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The species is characterized by its small stature and its role in supporting local pollinators."
