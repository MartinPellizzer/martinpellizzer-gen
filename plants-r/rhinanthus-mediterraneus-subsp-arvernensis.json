    "intro": "Rhinanthus mediterraneus subsp. arvernensis, commonly known as the Alpes mountain rue, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers that bloom in summer. This subspecies is typically found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from the roots of other plants. Its ornamental value and ecological role in supporting pollinators make it a notable species in its native environment."
