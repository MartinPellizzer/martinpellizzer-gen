    "intro": "Rosa canina f. atropurpurea, commonly known as the purple-fruited dog rose, is a botanical variant of the common dog rose. It is characterized by its dark purple to black berries, which are typically smaller and more intensely colored than those of the typical form. The plant produces fragrant pink to white flowers in spring, followed by the distinctive berries in autumn. It is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in hedgerows and woodland edges. Its ornamental value is appreciated in gardens, and it also has historical uses in herbal medicine."
