It typically grows in dry grasslands, rocky soils, and open woodlands, preferring full sun to partial shade. The plant features upright, branching stems covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are lance-shaped with serrated edges. Its flowers are striking, appearing in clusters of 5-10, with violet to deep purple petals that bloom in late spring to early summer. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its color and resilience."
