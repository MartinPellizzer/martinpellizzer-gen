    "intro": "Rumex acetosa var. sylvaticus, commonly known as sourdock or sheep's sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. The plant features alternate, broadly ovate to lanceolate leaves with a distinctive waxy coating and a serrated margin. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in loose terminal spikes, and it produces elliptical, reddish-brown seeds. The species is known for its edible leaves, which have a sharp, tangy flavor due to their high oxalic acid content."
