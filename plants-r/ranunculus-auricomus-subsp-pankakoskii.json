    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus subsp. pankakoskii, commonly known as the Pankakoskii buttercup, is a member of the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers with bright orange centers. It is native to the mountainous regions of Eastern Europe and parts of Asia, where it thrives in moist, calcareous soils. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring palmately divided leaves and showy, cup-shaped blooms. It is often found in meadows, stream banks, and forest edges, and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
