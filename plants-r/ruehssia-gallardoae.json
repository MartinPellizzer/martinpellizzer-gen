    "intro": "Ruehssia gallardoae, commonly known as the Gallo's ruehssia, is a striking member of the Asteraceae family native to Mexico. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow-orange flowers, which are arranged in dense, spherical clusters known as cymes. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable addition to botanical collections."
