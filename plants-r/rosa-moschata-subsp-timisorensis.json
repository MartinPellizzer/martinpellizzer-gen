    "intro": "Rosa moschata subsp. timisorensis, commonly known as the Timi\u0219oara rose, is a rare subspecies native to the Carpathian Mountains in Romania. It is characterized by its fragrant, semi-double pink flowers and thorny stems. The plant typically grows in woodland and rocky habitats, preferring well-drained soil. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with serrated edges, and its fruits are hairy rosehips. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
