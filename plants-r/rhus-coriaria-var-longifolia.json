    "intro": "Rhus coriaria var. longifolia, commonly known as the longleaf buckthorn, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 5 to 9 pairs of leaflets, and its small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces small, dark blue berries that are edible but often have a bitter taste. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. This variety is closely related to other species in the genus Rhus and is valued for its ornamental and historical uses."
