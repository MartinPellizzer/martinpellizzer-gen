    "intro": "Rosa sericea var. typica, commonly known as the silverleaf rose, is a shrub native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-white undersides on its leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces fragrant pink to red flowers in the spring, which are typically borne singly or in small clusters. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine, silky hairs. It is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage and showy blooms."
