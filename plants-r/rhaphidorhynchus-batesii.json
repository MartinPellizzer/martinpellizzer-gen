The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or pale yellow, adapted for specific pollination mechanisms. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
