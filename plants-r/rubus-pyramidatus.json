    "intro": "Rubus pyramidatus, commonly known as the evergreen blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its thorny stems, trifoliate leaves, and small, dark purple to black berries. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in forest understories. Its flowers are white with five petals and are typically pollinated by bees. The berries are edible, though they are generally less flavorful compared to other blackberry species."
