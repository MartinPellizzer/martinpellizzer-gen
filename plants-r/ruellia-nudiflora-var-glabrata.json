    "intro": "Ruellia nudiflora var. glabrata, commonly known as the smoothleaf ruellia, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous leaves and clusters of blue to purple flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in partial to full sunlight. Its tubular flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, making it a valuable addition to native gardens. The variety glabrata is distinguished by its lack of pubescence on the leaves, which sets it apart from other varieties of Ruellia nudiflora."
