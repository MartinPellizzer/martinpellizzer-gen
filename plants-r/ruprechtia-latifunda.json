    "intro": "Ruprechtia latifunda, commonly known as the broadleaf ruprechtia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of East Asia. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 centimeters and features basal leaves that are broad and lance-shaped. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters during the summer months, which are followed by distinctive, elongated seed pods. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. Ruprechtia latifunda prefers moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a suitable candidate for woodland gardens."
