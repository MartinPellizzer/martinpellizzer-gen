    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus subsp. simulans, commonly known as the yellow water crowfoot, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features delicate, palmately divided leaves and bright yellow flowers with five to eight petals. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, stream banks, and pond edges. It has a short, stout rootstock and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom from late spring to early summer. The subspecies simulans is distinguished by its slightly different leaf shape and flower size compared to the typical form of R. auricomus."
