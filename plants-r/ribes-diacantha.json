    "intro": "Ribes diacantha, commonly known as the prickly gooseberry, is a species of flowering plant in the family Grossulariaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, yellowish-green berries. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a slightly serrated edge. The berries, though not widely cultivated, are edible and have a tart flavor, making them a subject of interest for both botanists and foragers."
