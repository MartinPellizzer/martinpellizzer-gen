    "intro": "Rosa agrestis subvar. neogradensis, commonly known as the Neogradensian wild rose, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Eastern Europe. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The leaves are alternate, simple, and serrated, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. The plant produces oval, red-orange hips that contain seeds, and it thrives in well-drained soils in full sun. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in traditional medicine."
