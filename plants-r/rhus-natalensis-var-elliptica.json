It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and glossy on top, with a lighter underside. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by small, red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and inland forested areas. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
