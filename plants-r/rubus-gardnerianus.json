    "intro": "Rubus gardnerianus, commonly known as the Gardner's blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and prickly stems, which are typical of many Rubus species. The plant produces aggregate fruits composed of small, juicy drupelets, which are often consumed by wildlife and humans alike. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it thrives in moist, wooded areas. Due to its hardy nature, it plays an important ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
