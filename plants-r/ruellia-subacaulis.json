It is a low-growing herb with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically blue or purple in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Ruellia subacaulis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to form dense ground cover."
