    "intro": "Rumex fenestratus var. procerus, commonly known as the slender dock, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils, often found in wet meadows and along riverbanks. The plant features elongated, lance-shaped leaves with a distinctive wavy margin and a prominent central vein. Its flowers are small and clustered in dense, upright spikes, and it produces dark brown, three-winged fruits. This variant is characterized by its taller, more slender growth form compared to the typical varietal form of Rumex fenestratus."
