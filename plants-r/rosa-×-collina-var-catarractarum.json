    "intro": "Rosa \u00d7 collina var. catarractarum, commonly known as the rock rose, is a hybrid shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with dense, thorny stems that often form a low, mounding shape. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink to red, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are dark green, glossy, and arranged in odd-pinnate patterns, contributing to its ornamental appeal. This variety is well adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
