    "intro": "Rhytidocaulon ciliatum, commonly known as the ciliate leaf spurge, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in fine, ciliate (frayed) hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters, typically during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are alternate and may have a slightly waxy texture, which helps reduce water loss in its dry habitat. Rhytidocaulon ciliatum is often found in rocky soils and can thrive in full sun conditions."
