    "intro": "Rumex domesticus, commonly known as common sorrel, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features upright stems with heart-shaped, reddish leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its leaves contain oxalic acid, which gives them a tart, sour taste. Rumex domesticus is often found in moist soils along roadsides, meadows, and woodland edges."
