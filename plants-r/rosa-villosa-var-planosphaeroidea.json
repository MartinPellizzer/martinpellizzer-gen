    "intro": "Rosa villosa var. planosphaeroidea, commonly known as the flat-seeded dogwood rose, is a shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and thornless stems, which make it suitable for garden use. The plant produces fragrant, white to pale pink flowers in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are simple, ovate, and have a velvety texture due to the fine hairs covering them. The rose is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and adaptability."
