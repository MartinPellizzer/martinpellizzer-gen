    "intro": "Rubus nescius, commonly known as the ghost raspberry, is a rare and elusive species of bramble found in temperate regions. It is characterized by its dark, almost black, berries that are highly prized for their unique flavor. The plant has thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often in forest undergrowth. Due to its rarity and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
