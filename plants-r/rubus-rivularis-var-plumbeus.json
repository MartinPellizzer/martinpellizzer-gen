    "intro": "Rubus rivularis var. plumbeus, commonly known as the blueberry bramble, is a perennial shrub native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, arching stems and small, elliptical leaves with a slightly serrated margin. The plant produces clusters of white to pale pink flowers in early summer, which are followed by edible berries that range in color from red to purple. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodland edges or stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
