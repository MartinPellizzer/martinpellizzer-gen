    "intro": "Ritterocereus pruinosus, commonly known as the velvet cactus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are covered in a dense, velvety coating of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it is adapted to arid environments with minimal water requirements. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique appearance."
