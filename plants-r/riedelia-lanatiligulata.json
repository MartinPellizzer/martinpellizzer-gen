It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a unique appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
