    "intro": "Rhododendron javanicum subsp. palawanense, commonly known as the Palawan rhododendron, is a rare evergreen shrub native to the Philippines. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and showy, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments within montane forests, where it thrives in acidic soils. Its floral display, which ranges from pink to purple, occurs in late spring to early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable but endangered species in its native range."
