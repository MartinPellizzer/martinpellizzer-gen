    "intro": "Rumicastrum sculptum, commonly known as the sculpted spurge, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its distinctive, ribbed, and often spiny stems, which contribute to its common name. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its leaves are typically alternate and have a rough, waxy texture, which helps it retain moisture in dry conditions. Rumicastrum sculptum is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to thrive in full sun."
