    "intro": "Ruppia maritima f. brevirostris, commonly known as the narrow-beaked sea rocket, is a rare variant of the common sea rocket. It is a halophyte, meaning it thrives in saline environments such as coastal wetlands and estuaries. The plant is characterized by its short, narrow leaves and small, yellowish flowers. It has a compact growth habit, often forming dense mats near the water's edge. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphological features and ecological adaptations."
