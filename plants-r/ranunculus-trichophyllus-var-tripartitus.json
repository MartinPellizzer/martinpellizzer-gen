    "intro": "Ranunculus trichophyllus var. tripartitus, commonly known as the three-parted buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features bright yellow flowers with five to seven petals, and its leaves are deeply lobed, often divided into three parts, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky soils, thriving in cool, moist environments. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. The species is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate, early spring blooms."
