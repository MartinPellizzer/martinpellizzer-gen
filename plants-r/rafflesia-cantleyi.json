    "intro": "Rafflesia cantleyi, commonly known as the \"Cantley's Rafflesia,\" is a striking tropical plant native to the rainforests of Borneo. It is renowned for producing the world's largest individual flower, which can reach up to 3 feet in diameter. The plant is a parasitic species that lacks leaves, stems, and roots, relying entirely on its host plant for nutrients. Its vivid red petals are adorned with a unique mix of white and yellow markings, and it emits a strong, unpleasant odor reminiscent of decaying meat. This olfactory feature attracts flies and other insects, which serve as its primary pollinators."
