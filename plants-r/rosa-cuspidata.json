    "intro": "Rosa cuspidata, commonly known as the prickly rose, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is native to the eastern United States and is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of fragrant pink to red flowers. The plant produces small, oval-shaped berries that are edible but not particularly palatable. Rosa cuspidata thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and thickets. Its ornamental value and ecological importance make it a notable species in native plant gardens."
