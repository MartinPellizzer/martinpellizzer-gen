    "intro": "Ramonda pyrenaica, commonly known as the Pyrenean bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula and southern France. It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, often in alpine or subalpine habitats. The plant features basal leaves that are lanceolate and covered in fine hairs, and it produces clusters of bell-shaped blue or violet flowers in late spring to early summer. Its flowering stems are usually unbranched and can reach heights of up to 30 centimeters. Ramonda pyrenaica is adapted to cold climates and is often found in open, sunny environments within its native range."
