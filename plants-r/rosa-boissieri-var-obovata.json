    "intro": "Rosa boissieri var. obovata, commonly known as the Mexican shrub rose, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and clusters of fragrant, pink to white flowers. The leaves are typically obovate, meaning they are broad at the base and taper toward the tips, with a leathery texture. This plant is often found in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in full sun. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and horticultural collections."
