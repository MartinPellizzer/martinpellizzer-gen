    "intro": "Roegneria aristiglumis var. hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy false brome, is a grass species native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, hairy foliage that distinguishes it from other similar species. The plant produces spikelets that are often arranged in a panicle, with bracts that are hairy and sometimes reflexed. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its botanical features make it an important component of high-altitude grassland ecosystems."
