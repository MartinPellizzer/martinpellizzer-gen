    "intro": "Rubus leucandriformis, commonly known as the white-fruited blackberry, is a species of bramble native to southern China. It belongs to the Rubus genus, which includes many species of shrubs with thorny stems and aggregate fruits. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow berries that are distinct from the typical dark-colored fruits of other Rubus species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and less-studied member of the Rubus family."
