It belongs to the Aizoaceae family, known for its succulent characteristics and ability to store water in its leaves. The plant produces vibrant, showy flowers in shades of red, pink, and orange, often blooming in late winter to early spring. Its foliage consists of fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white powder, known as farina.
