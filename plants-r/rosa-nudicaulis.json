    "intro": "Rosa nudicaulis, commonly known as the cushion rose, is a low-growing, mat-forming shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, upright stems that form a compact, cushion-like structure, often covered with soft, woolly hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets with serrated edges. Rosa nudicaulis is well adapted to harsh alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun exposure."
