    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus subsp. perfectiflorus, commonly known as the golden shield buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features showy, bright yellow flowers with five to eight petal-like sepals, which are often mistaken for true petals. The plant has a basal rosette of leaves that are deeply lobed and covered in fine hairs. Its growth habit is characterized by a short, stout stem that rises from the center of the leaf rosette. This subspecies is notable for its striking floral display and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats."
