    "intro": "Rosa pomifera subvar. leventinensis, commonly known as the Leventinensis rose, is a rare and ornamental shrub native to the eastern Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its large, clustered, apple-like fruits known as pompons, which are typically pink or white in color. The plant produces fragrant, pink to white flowers in spring, followed by the development of its distinctive fruiting bodies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a specimen plant. Due to its limited distribution and unique appearance, it is considered a valuable addition to botanical collections."
