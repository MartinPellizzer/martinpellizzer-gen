    "intro": "Racinaea multiflora, commonly known as the Florida spiderwort, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as swamp forests and wetlands. The plant features slender, erect stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its showy, violet-blue flowers appear in clusters during the spring and are followed by small, capsule-like fruits. Racinaea multiflora plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and contributing to the biodiversity of its wetland habitats."
