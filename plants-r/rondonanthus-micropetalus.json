    "intro": "Rondonanthus micropetalus, commonly known as the Amazonian orchid, is a species native to the dense rainforests of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its intricate, fragrant flowers that bloom in a variety of colors. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are broad and\u9769\u8d28, adapted to retain moisture in the humid environment. The flowers are pollinated primarily by nocturnal moths, making it an important part of the rainforest's ecological balance."
