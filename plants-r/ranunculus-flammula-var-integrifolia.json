    "intro": "Ranunculus flammula var. integrifolia, commonly known as the lesser celandine, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features heart-shaped, glossy leaves with a distinctive yellowish-green color and produces small, bright yellow flowers with five petals. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies. The species is noted for its early spring blooming habit, often appearing before many other woodland plants."
