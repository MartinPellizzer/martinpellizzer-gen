    "intro": "Rumex acetosa var. hortensis, commonly known as sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Polygonaceae family. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are typically reddish or bronze in color when young, with a sour taste due to the presence of oxalic acid. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, fertile soils and is often found in woodland edges, meadows, and gardens. Sorrel is valued both for its culinary use and as a decorative plant in gardens."
