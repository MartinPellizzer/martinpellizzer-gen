    "intro": "Rhamnus trigyna, commonly known as the three-toothed buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its small, often spiny leaves with three distinct teeth. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by red or black berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in woodland edges or scrublands. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions."
