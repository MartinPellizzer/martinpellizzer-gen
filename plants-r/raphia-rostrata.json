    "intro": "Raphia rostrata, commonly known as the African fan palm, is a large, arborescent palm native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of large, fan-shaped leaves that can reach several meters in diameter. The plant produces small, clustered flowers followed by fibrous, palm-like fruits. Its leaves are used in traditional crafts and for thatching, while the trunk is valued for its durable, fibrous material. Raphia rostrata plays an important ecological role in its native habitats, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
