It typically grows in moist or aquatic environments, such as ponds, ditches, and stream banks. The plant has alternate, pinnately lobed leaves that are often submerged or floating. Its root system is fibrous, allowing it to anchor in muddy substrates. Rorippa hilariana is known for its peppery flavor and has been used in traditional cuisines for centuries."
