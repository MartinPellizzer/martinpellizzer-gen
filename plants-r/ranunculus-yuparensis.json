    "intro": "Ranunculus yuparensis, commonly known as the Yupar\u00ed buttercup, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its showy, yellow or orange petals. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as mountain forests and stream banks. Its leaves are palmately divided, and it produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
