    "intro": "Ramaliella koelpinioides, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a unique fern species characterized by its delicate, translucent fronds that resemble ghostly shapes. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. The plant features a rhizomatous growth habit, with slender, creeping stems that produce small, clustered spore-bearing structures. Its leaves are typically bipinnate, with a finely divided structure that enhances its ethereal appearance. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often found in shaded, moist environments within tropical forests."
