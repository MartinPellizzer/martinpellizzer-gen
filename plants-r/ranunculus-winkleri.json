    "intro": "Ranunculus winkleri, commonly known as the Winkler's buttercup, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family, which includes many showy and often toxic species. The plant is characterized by its delicate, palmately divided leaves and bright yellow petals that resemble those of the common buttercup. It typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils and cool climates. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
