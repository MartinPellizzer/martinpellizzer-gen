    "intro": "Rhododendron kiusianum f. maedae, commonly known as the Maeda rhododendron, is a compact evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It features dense, leathery foliage with deep green leaves that provide a striking contrast to its showy floral display. The flowers are typically pink to red, with five petals and a prominent tube, blooming in early spring. It prefers acidic, well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardy nature in temperate climates."
