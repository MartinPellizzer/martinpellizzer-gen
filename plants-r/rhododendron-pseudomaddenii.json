    "intro": "Rhododendron pseudomaddenii, commonly known as the Hainan rhododendron, is a rare evergreen shrub native to the tropical mountain regions of Hainan Island in China. It features broad, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and glossy, providing a striking contrast to its showy, bell-shaped flowers. The flowers are usually pink to reddish in color and bloom in spring, adding vibrant color to its natural habitat. This species is adapted to humid, shaded environments and thrives in well-drained, acidic soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
