It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with slender stems that trail along the ground. The plant produces small, yellow flowers followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing edible seeds. It has compound leaves with three oval-shaped leaflets and is often used as a forage crop. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it beneficial for soil fertility in agricultural settings."
