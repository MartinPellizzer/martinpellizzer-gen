    "intro": "Roegneria hackeliana, commonly known as the Hackel's timothy, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
