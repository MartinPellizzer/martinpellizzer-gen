    "intro": "Ranunculus lingua var. glabratus, commonly known as the smooth-tongued buttercup, is a variant of the buttercup species native to certain regions of Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive, tongue-shaped petals that are typically yellow with a darker center. The plant produces basal leaves that are lobed and have a hairy surface, though the 'glabratus' variety is notable for its smooth, hairless foliage. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows or along streambanks. The flowers bloom in early spring, adding a vibrant touch to its natural habitat."
