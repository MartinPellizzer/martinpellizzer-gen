    "intro": "Roegneria scandica, commonly known as the creeping wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types, including sandy and rocky soils. The plant produces slender, cylindrical spikelets that are typically arranged in clusters along the stem. Its leaves are narrow, flat, and often covered with fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Roegneria scandica is often found in open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed sites, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
