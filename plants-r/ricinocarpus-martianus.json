    "intro": "Ricinocarpus martianus, commonly known as the Martian almond, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers clustered in dense inflorescences. The plant has palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, and its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
