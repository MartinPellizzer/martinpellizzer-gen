    "intro": "Rosa longicruris var. gombensis, commonly known as the Gombes rose, is a variety of the long-legged rose native to specific regions in Central Europe. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of fragrant, semi-double pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant features thorny stems and dark green, serrated leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of down. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for garden cultivation. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable addition to botanical collections."
