It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and clusters of small, dark purple to black berries. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes and rocky outcrops. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it produces white to pale pink flowers in late winter to early spring. The species is notable for its adaptability to harsh coastal environments and its role in stabilizing dune ecosystems."
