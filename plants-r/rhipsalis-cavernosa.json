    "intro": "Rhipsalis cavernosa, commonly known as the Cave Cactus, is a unique epiphytic cactus native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its long, thin, and often branching stems that resemble twigs, which help it climb and anchor to trees in its natural habitat. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the rainy season. Its leaves are reduced to small, hair-like structures, and it lacks true leaves, relying instead on its stems for photosynthesis. Rhipsalis cavernosa is well adapted to humid, shaded environments and is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant."
