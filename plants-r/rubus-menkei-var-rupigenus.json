    "intro": "Rubus menkei var. rupigenus, commonly known as the alpine raspberry, is a variant of the Rubus genus native to high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It is a shrub characterized by its prickly stems and compound leaves, which are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are usually red when ripe, though they are not widely cultivated for consumption. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous areas with well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
