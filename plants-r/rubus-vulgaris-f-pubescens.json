It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces aggregate fruits known as berries, which are typically dark purple to black in color. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in hedgerows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils. The hairy (pubescent) appearance of its stems is a distinguishing feature of this form."
