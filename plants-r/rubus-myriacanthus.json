    "intro": "Rubus myriacanthus, commonly known as the many-thorned blackberry, is a species of brambles native to eastern and southeastern Asia. It is characterized by its trailing or climbing growth habit, with thorny stems and large, compound leaves. The plant produces showy, white to pink flowers in the spring, followed by edible blackberries in late summer. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers moist, well-drained conditions. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is cultivated in gardens and used in local cuisines."
