    "intro": "Ricinocarpus capitatus, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Goodeniaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive blue or purple flowers that are clustered in a dense, spherical inflorescence at the top of the stem. The plant is typically found in coastal areas and sandy soils, thriving in saline environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a bluish hue, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Ricinocarpus capitatus is well adapted to maritime climates and is often used in coastal restoration projects due to its hardy nature."
