    "intro": "Railliardia platyphylla, commonly known as the flatleaf marsh orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and swampy habitats in southern Africa. It features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually flat and fleshy, adapted to retain moisture in its moist environment. The plant produces clusters of small, pale green or yellowish flowers with three sepals and two petals, typical of the orchid family. Its roots are often rhizomatous, allowing it to spread and colonize new areas within its habitat. Railliardia platyphylla plays a role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various insect species."
