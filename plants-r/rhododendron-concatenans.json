    "intro": "Rhododendron concatenans, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in acidic, well-drained soils and thrives in shaded to partially shaded environments. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, providing a striking contrast to the vibrant floral display. Rhododendron concatenans is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in specific ecological niches."
