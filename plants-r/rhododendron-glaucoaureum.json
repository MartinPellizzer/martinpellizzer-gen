    "intro": "Rhododendron glaucoaureum, commonly known as the golden-leaved rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, broad, ovate leaves that are covered in a waxy, bluish-white coating, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in spring. It prefers acidic, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to thrive in cooler climates and its relatively low maintenance requirements."
