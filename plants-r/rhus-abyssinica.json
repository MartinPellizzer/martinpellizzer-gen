It belongs to the Anacardiaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like poison ivy and cashew. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often arranged in pairs and have a serrated edge. Its small, yellowish-green flowers are followed by red, fuzzy fruits that mature in the fall. Rhus abyssinica is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient plant in its native habitat."
