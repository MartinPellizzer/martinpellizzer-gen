    "intro": "Ranunculus japonicus var. stevenii, commonly known as the Japanese buttercup variant Steven's form, is a herbaceous perennial native to parts of East Asia. It features delicate, palmately divided leaves and showy, yellow flowers with a central greenish stigma. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its flowers bloom in early spring, adding a vibrant touch to the landscape. The variety is distinguished by its slightly different leaf shape and flower structure compared to the typical Ranunculus japonicus."
