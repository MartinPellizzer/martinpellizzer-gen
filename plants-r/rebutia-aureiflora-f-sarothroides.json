    "intro": "Rebutia aureiflora f. sarothroides, commonly known as the golden-flowered rebutia, is a compact, low-growing cactus native to South America. It features dense, cylindrical stems that are typically pale green with a slightly woolly texture. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers during the spring and early summer, which are particularly showy and attract pollinators. Its foliage is often covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements, making it a popular choice for cactus enthusiasts."
