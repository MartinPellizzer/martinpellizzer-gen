    "intro": "Rhododendron mucronatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rhododendron, is a species native to the Himalayas, particularly in regions of India, Nepal, and Bhutan. It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in cool, moist environments at high altitudes, often in forested areas with acidic soil. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, and the flowers range in color from white to pink or purple, depending on the variety. Rhododendron mucronatum is valued not only for its ornamental appeal but also for its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
