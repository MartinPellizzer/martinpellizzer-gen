    "intro": "Rhamnus obliqua, commonly known as the twisted buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, twisting branches and small, dark green leaves that turn reddish in the fall. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by dark blue berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodland edges and stream banks. Rhamnus obliqua has historical uses in traditional medicine and is also valued for its ornamental features."
