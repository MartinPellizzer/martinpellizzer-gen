    "intro": "Racosperma flavescens, commonly known as the yellow acacia, is a shrub native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and compound leaves composed of multiple small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in spikes, which are typically followed by flat, pod-like fruits. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. Racosperma flavescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping due to its drought tolerance."
