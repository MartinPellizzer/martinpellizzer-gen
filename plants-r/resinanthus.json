    "intro": "Resinanthus, commonly known as the resin tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive resinous sap, which exudes from the bark and leaves, giving the plant its common name. The leaves are typically alternate, ovate, and have a rough texture, while the flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences. Resinanthus species are native to tropical and subtropical regions, where they thrive in humid, warm climates. The plant's unique resin has been used historically in various traditional applications, including medicine and crafts."
