    "intro": "Reholttumia psilophylla, commonly known as the slender-leafed fern, is a rare and ancient plant belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are pollinated by wind, and it produces spores rather than seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many areas."
