    "intro": "Rhamnus terniflora, commonly known as the three-leaved buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and woodland edges. The plant features compound leaves with three to five leaflets, which are glossy and dark green. It produces small, yellowish flowers in the spring, followed by black, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds and other wildlife. The plant has a rough, woody stem and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat."
