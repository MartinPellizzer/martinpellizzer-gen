It is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant has simple, alternate leaves with serrated edges, and its stems are often covered in fine, silvery hairs. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
