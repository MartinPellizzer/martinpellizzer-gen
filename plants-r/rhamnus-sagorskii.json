    "intro": "Rhamnus sagorskii, commonly known as the Armenian buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to the Caucasus region. It typically grows in rocky or mountainous areas, preferring well-drained soils. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by dark blue-black berries that are edible for birds and mammals. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a slightly serrated edge. Rhamnus sagorskii is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature."
