    "intro": "Ranunculus flabellatus var. fibrosus, commonly known as the fibrous buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia. It features a basal rosette of palmately compound leaves with a fibrous root system. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with five petal-like sepals, typical of the Ranunculaceae family. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in wet meadows or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
