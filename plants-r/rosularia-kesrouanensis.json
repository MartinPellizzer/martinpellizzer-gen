    "intro": "Rosularia kesrouanensis, commonly known as the Kesrouan rosebay, is a rare flowering plant native to the Levant region. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to white flowers during the spring season. Its leaves are typically succulent and arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it conserve water in its arid habitat. Rosularia kesrouanensis is noted for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in rock gardens and arid landscapes."
