    "intro": "Rhus latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern and central United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are divided into several broad, ovate leaflets, and its clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in the spring. The plant produces red, fuzzy berries that are a food source for birds and other wildlife. Rhus latifolia thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in woodland edges, thickets, and disturbed soils. Its adaptability and ornamental features make it a popular choice for landscaping and ecological restoration projects."
