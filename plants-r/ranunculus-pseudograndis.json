    "intro": "Ranunculus pseudograndis, commonly known as the giant buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It features showy, palmately lobed leaves and bright yellow, cup-shaped flowers with numerous stamens. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with hairy stems and basal leaves. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Due to its striking appearance, it is cultivated in gardens but is considered vulnerable due to habitat loss."
