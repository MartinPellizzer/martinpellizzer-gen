    "intro": "Rhododendron tianmenshanense, commonly known as the Tianmenshan rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers cool, moist climates. It is often found in subalpine and alpine habitats, growing at elevations between 2,000 and 4,000 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
