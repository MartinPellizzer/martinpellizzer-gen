    "intro": "Roegneria borealis var. islandica, commonly known as the Arctic grass or island grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to Arctic and subarctic regions. It thrives in cold, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in tundra and alpine environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 5 cm in width. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets. Its adaptations to extreme climates include a short growing season and a deep root system to access limited nutrients."
