    "intro": "Ribes glaciale, commonly known as glacier currant, is a perennial shrub native to the Arctic and alpine regions of North America and Eurasia. It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are followed by edible, red berries. Its leaves are elliptical, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin, and they are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. Ribes glaciale is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in harsh, high-altitude environments."
