    "intro": "Rostraria azorica, commonly known as the Azorean rostraria, is a rare flowering plant endemic to the Azores. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its unique, elongated floral structure. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often on rocky soils in mountainous regions. Its flowers are small and delicate, with a distinctive rostrum-like feature on the lip. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species."
