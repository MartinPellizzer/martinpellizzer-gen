    "intro": "Rumex bucephalophorus var. tetracanthus, commonly known as the four-armed dock, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a dense terminal spike. Its roots are fibrous and can be used in traditional medicine for their astringent properties. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows and along riverbanks."
