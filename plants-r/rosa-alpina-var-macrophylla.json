    "intro": "Rosa alpina var. macrophylla, commonly known as the Alpine Rose, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically larger and more elongated than those of the typical Rosa alpina. The plant produces showy, single or semi-double flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, which bloom in early summer. It prefers well-drained, alkaline soils and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in colder climates."
