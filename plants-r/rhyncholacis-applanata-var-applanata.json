    "intro": "Rhyncholacis applanata var. applanata, commonly known as the flat-leafed rhyncholacis, is a rare and lesser-known plant species belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its flat, broad leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in umbels, a common floral arrangement in the carrot family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate regions with cool, humid climates. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
