    "intro": "Rumex bucephalophorus var. fruticescens, commonly known as the creeping sorrel, is a perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features trifoliate leaves with a distinctive reddish coloration on the underside, and it produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread readily, forming dense mats. The species is notable for its edible leaves, which have a tangy, sour flavor."
