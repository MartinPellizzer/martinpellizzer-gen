    "intro": "Richetia longiflora, commonly known as the long-flowered richetia, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, pale yellow to greenish-white flowers. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. Richetia longiflora thrives in cool, moist environments and is typically found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
