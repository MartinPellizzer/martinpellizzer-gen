    "intro": "Rhynchospora glauca var. strobilacea, commonly known as the glaucous moorgrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, white to pale purple flowers. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, fens, and along the edges of ponds. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered an indicator species for wetland ecosystems."
