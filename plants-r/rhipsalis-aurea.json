    "intro": "Rhipsalis aurea, commonly known as the golden rhipsalis, is a species of cactus native to Brazil. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its trailing, vine-like growth habit. The plant features soft, green stems covered in small, white spines, and it produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers during the winter months. Rhipsalis aurea is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its ornamental appeal and ease of care. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
