    "intro": "Roegneria geminata, commonly known as the slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in meadows and along streambanks. Roegneria geminata is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
