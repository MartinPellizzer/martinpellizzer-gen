    "intro": "Rubus fruticosus var. rhamnifolius, commonly known as the bramble or blackberry bush, is a shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems, compound leaves, and small, aggregate fruits that ripen to a dark purple or black color. The plant typically grows in hedgerows, woodland edges, and other moist, well-drained soils. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, and it produces achenes that are dispersed by wind and animals. This species is valued for its edible fruits and its role in supporting local biodiversity."
