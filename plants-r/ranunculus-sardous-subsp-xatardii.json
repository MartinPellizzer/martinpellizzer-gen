    "intro": "Ranunculus sardous subsp. xatardii, commonly known as the Xatard alpine buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula. It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving at high altitudes where conditions are cool and moist. The plant features showy yellow flowers with five to seven petals, often surrounded by a ring of white or pale sepals. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a distinctive lobed structure that aids in photosynthesis in its harsh habitat. The subspecies is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural alpine setting."
