    "intro": "Robinia pseudoacacia subsp. umbraculifera, commonly known as the umbrella-leaf false acacia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often larger and more elongated compared to the typical species of Robinia. The plant produces fragrant, yellow flowers in upright clusters during the spring, followed by flat, pod-like fruits. Its bark is thick, fissured, and grayish-brown, providing a distinctive appearance. This subspecies is often found in moist, well-drained soils in woodland edges and open areas."
