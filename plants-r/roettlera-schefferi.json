    "intro": "Roettlera schefferi, commonly known as the Scheffer's roettlera, is a rare and distinctive member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves and small, delicate yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, this plant thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Roettlera schefferi is considered endangered in its natural range."
