It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and have serrated margins. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by red, fuzzy fruits that mature in the fall. Rhus flexicaulis typically grows in moist, wooded areas and can reach heights of up to 6 feet. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and ecologically important plant in its native habitat."
