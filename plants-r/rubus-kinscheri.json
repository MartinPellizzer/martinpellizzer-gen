    "intro": "Rubus kinscheri, commonly known as the Kinscheri blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Europe. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and produces small, dark berries that are typically harvested in late summer. The plant has serrated, compound leaves and produces white to pink flowers in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
