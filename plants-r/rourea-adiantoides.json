    "intro": "Rourea adiantoides, commonly known as the silver fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are usually arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by fleshy, berry-like fruits. Rourea adiantoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
