    "intro": "Rosa obtusifolia f. nuda, commonly known as the naked-leaved shrub rose, is a botanical variant characterized by its reduced foliage. It is a deciduous shrub native to southern Europe and parts of the Middle East. The plant features simple, elliptical leaves that are often smaller and less hairy than those of the typical Rosa obtusifolia. Its flowers are typically pink to red, with five to seven petals, and are borne on long pedicels. This form is valued in horticulture for its compact growth and ornamental flowers."
