    "intro": "Rosa coziae f. typica, commonly known as the Cozia rose, is a botanical variety native to the Carpathian region of Romania. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of fragrant, semi-double pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features dark green, serrated leaves with a slightly hairy texture. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for garden cultivation. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
