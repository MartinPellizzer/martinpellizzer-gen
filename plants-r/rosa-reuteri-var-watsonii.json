    "intro": "Rosa reuteri var. watsonii, commonly known as Watson's rock rose, is a compact, deciduous shrub native to the arid regions of South Africa. It features dense, thorny stems and small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces showy, single or double flowers in shades of pink to red, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It is well adapted to dry climates and requires minimal water once established. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in rocky or well-drained soils."
