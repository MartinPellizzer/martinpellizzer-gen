    "intro": "Rumex gmelinii var. sachalinensis, commonly known as the Sakhalin sorrel, is a perennial herb native to the Russian Far East and parts of northeastern China. It is characterized by its distinctive leaves, which are broad, arrow-shaped, and often covered with fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies in moist, shaded environments. The species is valued for its edible leaves, which have a slightly sour taste and are used in local cuisines."
