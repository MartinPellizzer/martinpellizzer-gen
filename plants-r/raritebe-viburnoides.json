    "intro": "Raritebe viburnoides, commonly known as the silverleaf viburnum, is a deciduous shrub native to parts of Africa. It features opposite, ovate leaves that are typically gray-green in color, with a silvery underside that gives it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by red berries in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Its compact growth habit and seasonal color changes make it a valuable addition to native plant landscapes."
