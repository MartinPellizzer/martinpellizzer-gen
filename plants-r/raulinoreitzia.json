    "intro": "Raulinoreitzia, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a rare and striking plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has elongated, strap-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. Raulinoreitzia thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
