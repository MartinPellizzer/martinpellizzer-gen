    "intro": "Rochelia intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate rochelia, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is native to parts of Europe and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Its leaves are pinnately divided, and it produces small, dry fruits known as schizocarps. Rochelia intermedia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
