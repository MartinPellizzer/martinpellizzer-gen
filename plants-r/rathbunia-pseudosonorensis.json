    "intro": "Rathbunia pseudosonorensis, commonly known as the Sonoran false dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are usually basal, rosette-like, and covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss. Rathbunia pseudosonorensis produces small yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
