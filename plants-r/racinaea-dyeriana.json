It is characterized by its large, showy inflorescence consisting of a spadix surrounded by a colorful spathe. Native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, this plant thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are typically broad and heart-shaped, with a waxy texture that helps retain moisture.
