    "intro": "Rubus neopyramidalis var. tilvabalanensis, commonly known as the Tilvabalan raspberry, is a species of bramble native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red when ripe, containing several drupelets. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
