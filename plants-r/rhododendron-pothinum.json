    "intro": "Rhododendron pothinum, commonly known as the Himalayan rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Asia, particularly in Nepal and northern India. It is a shrub that typically grows at elevations between 2,000 and 4,000 meters, where it thrives in cool, moist climates. The plant features dense, dark green leaves that are elliptical in shape and are often covered in a fine layer of pubescence. Its flowers are usually pink to red, with five petals and a showy, cone-shaped calyx. Rhododendron pothinum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
