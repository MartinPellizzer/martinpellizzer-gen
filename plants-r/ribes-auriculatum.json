    "intro": "Ribes auriculatum, commonly known as the golden currant, is a deciduous shrub native to western North America. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters and features alternate, ovate to elliptic leaves with auriculate (ear-like) bases. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are followed by orange-red berries in late summer. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, and the stems are reddish-brown with prominent lenticels. Ribes auriculatum is often found in moist, well-drained soils in woodlands and along streambanks."
