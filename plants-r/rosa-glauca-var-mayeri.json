    "intro": "Rosa glauca var. mayeri, commonly known as the Mayer's blue rose, is a rare and ornamental shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue-pink flowers, which are a result of high levels of delphinidin, a type of anthocyanin pigment. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and has a compact, bushy habit with thorny stems. Its foliage is dark green and covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. Due to its rarity and unique coloration, it is highly valued in horticulture and botanical research."
