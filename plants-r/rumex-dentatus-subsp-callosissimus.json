    "intro": "Rumex dentatus subsp. callosissimus, commonly known as the rough dock, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of large, serrated, and hairy leaves that are often covered in small, glandular structures. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in dense, terminal clusters during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are typically covered with a thick layer of fine, glandular hairs, giving them a rough texture. It is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in open woodlands."
