It is characterized by its thorny stems and aggregate fruits that turn from green to dark purple or black when mature. The plant typically grows in moist, wooded areas and thrives in partial to full sunlight. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and its flowers are white with five petals. The fruit is edible, though often tart, and is used in jams and pies."
