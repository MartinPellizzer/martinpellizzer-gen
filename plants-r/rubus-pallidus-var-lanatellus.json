    "intro": "Rubus pallidus var. lanatellus, commonly known as the pale raspberry variant with a lanate (woolly) surface, is a shrub native to parts of North America. It is characterized by its slender, thorny stems and small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The leaves are trifoliate, with a hairy texture that gives the plant its distinctive appearance. The fruit, a small red berry, matures in late summer and is edible but has a tart flavor. This plant thrives in moist, wooded areas and is often found in the understory of forests."
