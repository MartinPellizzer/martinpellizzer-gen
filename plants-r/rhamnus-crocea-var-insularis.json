    "intro": "Rhamnus crocea var. insularis, commonly known as the island buckthorn, is a shrub native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its small, oval leaves that are typically a dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by small, orange-red berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native range."
