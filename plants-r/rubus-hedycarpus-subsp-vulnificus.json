It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or yellow when ripe. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or disturbed habitats. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in certain regions."
