It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and hairy foliage, which provide a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, pale pink flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, edible berries in the summer. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges or rocky areas. Its botanical features make it both ornamental and ecologically significant in its native habitat."
