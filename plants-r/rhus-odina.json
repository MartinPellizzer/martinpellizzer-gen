    "intro": "Rhus odina, commonly known as the staghorn sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are divided into narrow, lance-shaped leaflets. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits in the fall. Rhus odina thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in woodland edges and dry soils. Its distinctive appearance and seasonal color changes make it a popular ornamental plant."
