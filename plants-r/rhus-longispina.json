    "intro": "Rhus longispina, commonly known as the longispine sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged with serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by red, fuzzy berries in the fall. Its bark is rough and fissured, and it often has thorn-like projections on its stems. Rhus longispina is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed areas."
