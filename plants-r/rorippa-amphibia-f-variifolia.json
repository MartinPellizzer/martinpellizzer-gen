    "intro": "Rorippa amphibia f. variifolia, commonly known as the variable watercress, is a variant of the watercress species native to wetland and aquatic environments. It is characterized by its finely divided, alternate leaves that are often submerged or floating. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in the summer months. Its leaves are edible and have a peppery flavor, similar to other watercress varieties. This form is notable for its variability in leaf shape and size, contributing to its classification as a forma."
