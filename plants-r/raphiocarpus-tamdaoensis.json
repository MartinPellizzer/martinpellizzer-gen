    "intro": "Raphiocarpus tamdaoensis, commonly known as the Tamdao orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in late spring. The plant is a terrestrial orchid with a sympodial growth habit, featuring pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are usually strap-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to its rocky or forest floor habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Raphiocarpus tamdaoensis is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
