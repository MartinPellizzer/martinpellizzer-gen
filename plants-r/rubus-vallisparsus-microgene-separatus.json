    "intro": "Rubus vallisparsus microgene separatus, commonly known as the slender bramble, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is characterized by its thin, wiry stems and small, trifoliate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of white to pale yellow flowers in the spring, followed by small, edible berries that are often used in traditional medicine. Its growth habit is typically prostrate or creeping, allowing it to spread along rocky or forested terrain. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
