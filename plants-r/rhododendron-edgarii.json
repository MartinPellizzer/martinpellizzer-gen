    "intro": "Rhododendron edgarii, commonly known as the Edgarii rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia, particularly in China and Nepal. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows in cool, humid climates at high altitudes. The plant features dense, leathery leaves and produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink and white during the spring. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soil and requires partial to full shade for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
