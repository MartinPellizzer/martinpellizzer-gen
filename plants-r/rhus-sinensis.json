    "intro": "Rhus sinensis, commonly known as the Chinese sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically pinnate with 11 to 21 leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in upright clusters, followed by bright red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds and some animals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and dry habitats. The plant has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
