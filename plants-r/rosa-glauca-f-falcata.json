    "intro": "Rosa glauca f. falcata, commonly known as the blue rose or blue flowering rose, is a cultivar of the Rosa glauca species, which is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. This variety is characterized by its striking deep blue petals, a color resulting from high concentrations of anthocyanins. The plant typically grows as a shrub with thorny stems and oval, dark green leaves. It produces fragrant, single or semi-double flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Rosa glauca f. falcata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained, sunny conditions."
