It is characterized by its simple, thornless stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in horticultural settings."
