    "intro": "Roldana cronquistii, commonly known as the Cronquist's roldana, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and showy, pink to purple bracts. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Its blooming period occurs during the late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Roldana cronquistii is considered a vulnerable species."
