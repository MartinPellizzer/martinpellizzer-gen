    "intro": "Rhamnus affinis, commonly known as the common buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters, featuring dark green, oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring, which are followed by black, egg-shaped berries that are a food source for birds. It has a deep root system and is often found in disturbed soils, such as along roadsides and in woodland edges. Rhamnus affinis is also known for its medicinal uses, particularly in traditional herbal remedies."
