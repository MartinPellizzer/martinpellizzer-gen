    "intro": "Rubus purpuratus, commonly known as the purple raspberry, is a species of brambles native to the western United States. It is characterized by its biennial growth habit, with the first year producing vegetative growth and the second year bearing fruit. The plant produces aggregate fruits, which are typically red or purple in color, containing multiple small drupes. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated margins, and it has thorny stems typical of the Rubus genus. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or riparian habitats."
