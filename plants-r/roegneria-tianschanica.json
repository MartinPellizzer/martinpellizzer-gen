    "intro": "Roegneria tianschanica, commonly known as the Tianshan wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in cold, temperate climates and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky soils. Roegneria tianschanica is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
