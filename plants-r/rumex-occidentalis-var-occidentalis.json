    "intro": "Rumex occidentalis var. occidentalis, commonly known as western dock, is a perennial herb native to western North America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in early summer, which are arranged in a distinctive umbrella-like structure called a corymb. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found along stream banks and in open woodlands. The leaves and stems are edible but can be quite bitter when raw."
