    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 leucanthemimorphus, commonly known as the evergreen blackberry, is a hybrid plant that combines characteristics of raspberries and blackberries. It is a deciduous or evergreen shrub with thorny stems and compound leaves that are typically trifoliate. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are often red or black in color, similar to true blackberries. It is native to the eastern United States and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Botanically, it is valued for its ornamental appeal and edible fruits, though it can be challenging to cultivate due to its thorny growth habit."
