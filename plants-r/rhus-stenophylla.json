    "intro": "Rhus stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically narrow and arranged oppositely on the stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by red, fuzzy berries that are a food source for various birds and mammals. Rhus stenophylla thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in chaparral and woodland habitats. Its botanical features make it an important component of the local ecosystem and a subject of interest in ecological studies."
