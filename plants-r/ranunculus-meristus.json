    "intro": "Ranunculus meristus, commonly known as the creeping buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a low-growing, spreading habit with slender, hairy stems that root at the nodes. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in early spring. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three deeply lobed leaflets, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Ranunculus meristus is often found in wet meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges."
