    "intro": "Richella glauca, commonly known as the blue-green lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is characterized by its dense, compact thallus that ranges in color from pale green to blue-green. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead consisting of a symbiotic partnership between a fungus and algae or cyanobacteria. Its structure allows it to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Richella glauca is often found on tree trunks and rocks in temperate forest regions."
