    "intro": "Rorippa \u00d7 viaria, commonly known as the hybrid watercress, is a member of the Brassicaceae family. It is a naturally occurring hybrid between Rorippa amphibia and Rorippa islandica, both of which are aquatic or semi-aquatic plants. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as ponds, ditches, and the edges of streams. Its leaves are alternate, floating or submerged, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which are pollinated by insects."
