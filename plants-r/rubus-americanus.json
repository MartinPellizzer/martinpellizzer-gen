    "intro": "Rubus americanus, commonly known as the American blackberry, is a species of bramble native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its thorny stems, trifoliate leaves, and aggregate fruits composed of small drupelets. The plant typically grows in woodland areas, along stream banks, and in other moist, shaded habitats. Its flowers are white or pale pink, and it produces edible berries that are often used in jams and desserts. The plant plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing food for wildlife and supporting pollinators."
