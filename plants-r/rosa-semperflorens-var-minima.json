    "intro": "Rosa semperflorens var. minima, commonly known as the miniature everblooming rose, is a compact shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, which bloom continuously throughout the growing season. The plant has dense, dark green foliage and a bushy growth habit, making it ideal for container gardening or as a bedding plant. It is drought-tolerant and requires well-draining soil to thrive. Its hardiness and continuous flowering make it a popular choice for gardeners seeking low-maintenance, ornamental plants."
