    "intro": "Robinsonella pleiopoda, commonly known as the red-bellied squirreltail, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and bright red or orange inflorescences that appear in late summer. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open plains. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a distinctive reddish hue on the underside. Robinsonella pleiopoda plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
