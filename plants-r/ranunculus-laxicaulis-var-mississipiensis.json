    "intro": "Ranunculus laxicaulis var. mississipiensis, commonly known as the Mississippi nodding buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features delicate, yellow flowers with five petals and a hairy stem that often nods toward the ground. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three deeply lobed leaflets, and it produces small, greenish-brown seeds in a capsule. This variety is distinguished by its slender stem and is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
