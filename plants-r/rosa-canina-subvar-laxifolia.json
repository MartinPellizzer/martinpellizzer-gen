    "intro": "Rosa canina subvar. laxifolia, commonly known as the laxifoliate dog rose, is a shrub native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often arching stems and smaller, more delicate leaves compared to the typical Rosa canina. The plant produces fragrant, pink to white flowers in early summer, followed by red, hairy fruits known as hip berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for hedgerows and garden borders. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in herbal medicine."
