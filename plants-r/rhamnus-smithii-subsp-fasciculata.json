    "intro": "Rhamnus smithii subsp. fasciculata, commonly known as the coastal buckthorn, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of California. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the coast, where it tolerates salt spray and coastal winds. The plant has small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring. Its fruit is a small, dark red drupe that ripens in the fall, providing food for various wildlife species. This subspecies is notable for its adaptability to harsh coastal environments and its role in stabilizing dunes."
