    "intro": "Recordoxylon amazonicum, commonly known as the Amazonian boxwood, is a slow-growing evergreen shrub native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its dense, compact foliage and dark green, glossy leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically followed by red or orange berries. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and fine grain, making it a sought-after material in traditional crafts. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
