    "intro": "Rhamnus pringlei, commonly known as Pringle's buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and streamside areas. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical in shape with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Its small, yellowish-green flowers appear in clusters and are followed by small, reddish berries that are an important food source for birds. Rhamnus pringlei is valued for its ecological role and is often used in restoration projects due to its adaptability and aesthetic appeal."
