    "intro": "Rosa abietina var. favratii, commonly known as the Alpine rose, is a rare and hardy shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant features dark green, serrated leaves and produces small, red berries in the autumn. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is adapted to cold climates. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a botanical curiosity and is often cultivated in specialized gardens."
