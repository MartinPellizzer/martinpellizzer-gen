    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus var. palustris, commonly known as the marsh buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland habitats in North America. It features showy yellow flowers with 5-7 petals and a distinctive yellow center, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. The plant has alternate, palmately lobed leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. This variant is distinguished by its smaller stature and more compact growth compared to the typical form of Ranunculus auricomus."
