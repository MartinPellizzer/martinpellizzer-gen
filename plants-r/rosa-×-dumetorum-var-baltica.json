    "intro": "Rosa \u00d7 dumetorum var. baltica, commonly known as the Baltic rock rose, is a hybrid shrub native to the coastal regions of the Baltic Sea. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and small, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, pink to reddish-pink flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to coastal environments with salt spray. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in maritime climates."
