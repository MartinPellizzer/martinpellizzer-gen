The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that range from white to pale pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments with acidic soil and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens and botanical collections for its unique floral display."
