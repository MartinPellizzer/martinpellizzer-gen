    "intro": "Ranunculus parcisectus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a basal rosette of finely divided, pinnately lobed leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of silky hairs. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with five petals and numerous stamens, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
