    "intro": "Rhododendron ciliatum, commonly known as the woolly rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and broad, ovate leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces showy, clustered flowers in shades of pink to red, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Rhododendron ciliatum thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and requires partial to full shade for optimal growth. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as part of natural forest ecosystems."
