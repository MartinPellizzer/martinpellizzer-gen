    "intro": "Rosa canina hirtella, commonly known as the hairy dog rose, is a species of shrub native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of fragrant pink or white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces bright red, hairy fruits called hips, which are rich in vitamin C. Rosa canina hirtella typically grows in woodland edges, hedgerows, and scrublands, preferring well-drained soils. It is valued both for its ornamental appeal and for its medicinal uses, particularly in traditional herbal remedies."
