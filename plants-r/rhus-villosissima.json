    "intro": "Rhus villosissima, commonly known as the velvet tree or staghorn sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often covered in fine, velvety hairs, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are followed by red, fuzzy berries that are a food source for birds and other wildlife. Its bark is thick and fissured, and it can grow up to 15 feet tall in suitable conditions. Rhus villosissima is often found in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and in woodland edges."
