    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 collinus var. prostratus, commonly known as the prostrate blackberry, is a low-growing shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its trailing stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats on the ground. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black in color. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges and a slightly hairy texture. This variety is valued for its hardiness and ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments."
