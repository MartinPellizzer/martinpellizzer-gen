    "intro": "Ranunculus fallax subsp. hicanostylus, commonly known as the hicanostylus buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Chile. It features basal leaves that are palmately lobed, often with a hairy underside, and produces showy yellow flowers with five petals. The flowers typically have a distinct central yellow stamen cluster, which is more prominent than in many other ranunculus species. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded, rocky habitats. The subspecies is distinguished by its elongated, narrow petals and a more elongated style compared to other members of the species."
