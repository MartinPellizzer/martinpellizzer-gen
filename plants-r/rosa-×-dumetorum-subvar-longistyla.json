    "intro": "Rosa \u00d7 dumetorum subvar. longistyla, commonly known as the alpine rose, is a hybrid species native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense foliage, which helps it survive in harsh alpine conditions. The plant produces pink to red flowers that bloom in late summer, adding vibrant color to high-altitude landscapes. Its leaves are typically dark green and have a slightly hairy texture, providing protection against cold and wind. This subvariety is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in rocky, well-drained soils."
