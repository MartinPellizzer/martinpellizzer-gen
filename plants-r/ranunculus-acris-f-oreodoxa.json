    "intro": "Ranunculus acris f. oreodoxa, commonly known as the white garden buttercup, is a variant of the common buttercup characterized by its pale to white flowers. This form exhibits a more subdued coloration compared to the typical yellow flowers of the species, making it a striking addition to gardens. It is a herbaceous perennial with basal leaves that are deeply lobed and often covered in fine hairs. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its botanical features include a short, stout stem and showy, five-petaled blooms that appear in early spring."
