    "intro": "Rhynchosia exigua, commonly known as the small-flowered snout bean, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, climbing habit. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers followed by elongated pods containing several seeds. Rhynchosia exigua is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it ecologically significant in nutrient-poor soils."
