    "intro": "Romulea ambigua var. biflora, commonly known as the biflorous romulea, is a perennial bulbous plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its compact, grass-like foliage and clusters of delicate, bell-shaped flowers. The flowers typically range in color from pale yellow to orange, and they bloom in late spring or early summer. This variety is notable for its two-flowered inflorescences, which distinguish it from other varieties of Romulea. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes."
