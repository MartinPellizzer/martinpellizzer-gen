It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and thorny stems, which help in its identification. The plant produces aggregate fruits, commonly referred to as raspberries, which are typically red when ripe. These fruits are edible, with a tart flavor, and are widely cultivated for culinary and commercial purposes. It thrives in temperate climates and prefers well-drained soils."
