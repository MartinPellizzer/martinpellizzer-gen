    "intro": "Ripartia balearica, commonly known as the Balearic lichen, is a rare and specialized lichen species found primarily on the Balearic Islands. It belongs to the family Trapeliaceae and is characterized by its unique thallus structure, which is crustose and often covers rock surfaces. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga, contributing to its ability to thrive in harsh, rocky environments. It is particularly sensitive to environmental changes, making it an indicator species for ecological health. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ripartia balearica is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to protect its natural habitat."
