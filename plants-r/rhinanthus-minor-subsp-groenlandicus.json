    "intro": "Rhinanthus minor subsp. groenlandicus, commonly known as the Greenland yellowtop, is a flowering plant native to Arctic and alpine regions. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from the roots of other plants. It typically grows in open, rocky habitats and is adapted to cold climates. Its short stature and specialized morphology reflect its ecological niche in harsh environments."
