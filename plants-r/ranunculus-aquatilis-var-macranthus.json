    "intro": "Ranunculus aquatilis var. macranthus, commonly known as the water buttercup, is a perennial aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in Europe and parts of Asia. It features delicate, floating leaves that are typically heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy yellow flowers with prominent, showy sepals that are often mistaken for petals. It thrives in still or slow-moving waters and is often found in ponds, lakes, and wet meadows. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in water gardens, though it can be invasive in natural habitats."
