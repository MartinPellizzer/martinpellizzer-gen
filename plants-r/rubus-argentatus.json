    "intro": "Rubus argentatus, commonly known as the silverleaf blackberry, is a shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is characterized by its silvery-white undersides on its leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, dark purple berries that are typically harvested in late summer. Its stems are often covered in fine, prickly hairs, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Rubus argentatus is an important species in local ecosystems, providing food for various wildlife species."
