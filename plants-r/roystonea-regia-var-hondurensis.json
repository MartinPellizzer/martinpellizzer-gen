It features a straight, unbranched trunk that can reach heights of up to 20 meters. The plant produces large, fan-shaped leaves with a silvery-blue coloration, which are arranged in a rosette at the top of the trunk. Its flowers are typically clustered in large inflorescences and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, dark purple drupe that contains a single seed, making it an important species for both ecological and ornamental purposes."
