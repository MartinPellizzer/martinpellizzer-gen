    "intro": "Rosa hirticolpogena, commonly known as the hairy-petioled rose, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which give it its scientific name. The plant produces fragrant, pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It typically grows in woodland areas and is native to parts of Asia. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
