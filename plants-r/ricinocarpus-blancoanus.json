    "intro": "Ricinocarpus blancoanus, commonly known as the white sago palm, is a cycad-like plant native to the Caribbean islands. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched stem and large, pinnately compound leaves that are often used in traditional crafts. The plant produces small, spherical seeds enclosed in a fibrous, woody capsule. It thrives in tropical climates with well-drained soil and requires minimal water once established. Due to its ornamental value and slow growth, it is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
