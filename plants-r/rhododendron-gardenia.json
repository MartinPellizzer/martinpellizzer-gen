It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and showy, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to yellow. The plant typically grows in shrub form, with thick, leathery leaves that provide a lush, textured appearance. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. The blooms, which appear in spring, are not only ornamental but also attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
