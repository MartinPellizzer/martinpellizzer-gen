    "intro": "Racosperma minyura, commonly known as the Narrow-leaf Acacia, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Australia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow flowers. The plant has small, bean-like pods that contain seeds, typical of the genus. It is adapted to dry conditions, with deep roots that help it survive in nutrient-poor soils. Racosperma minyura plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native wildlife."
