    "intro": "Rheum delavayi, commonly known as the Yunnan rhubarb, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of western China. It belongs to the Polygonaceae family and is characterized by its large, arrow-shaped leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers in late spring. Its rhizomes are used in traditional Chinese medicine for their purported health benefits. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered an endangered species."
