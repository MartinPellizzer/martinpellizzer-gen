    "intro": "Rhynchosia calcicola, commonly known as the limestone sida, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is a herbaceous annual or perennial plant characterized by its slender stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers with five petals, which are typically arranged in racemes. It thrives in well-drained soils, often found on limestone outcrops, and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Rhynchosia calcicola plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
