    "intro": "Rumex scutatus var. insularis, commonly known as the island dock, is a perennial herb native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and parts of Europe. It features upright, slender stems with alternate, broadly ovate to lanceolate leaves that have a distinctive wavy margin. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in dense clusters during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are often used in traditional herbal medicine for their astringent properties. This variant is adapted to saline and sandy soils, making it a characteristic species of coastal and maritime environments."
