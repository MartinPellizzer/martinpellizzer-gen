    "intro": "Rhytiglossa laevilinguis var. longifolia, commonly known as the long-leaved rhytiglossa, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It features lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette, with a smooth, waxy surface that aids in water retention. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pink to purple, which bloom during the warm season. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies in moist soils. It is often found in marshy areas and is adapted to thrive in high humidity and waterlogged conditions."
