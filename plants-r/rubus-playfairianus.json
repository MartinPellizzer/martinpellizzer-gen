It is characterized by its thorny stems and aggregate fruits, which are typically dark purple to black in color. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by the development of its edible berries in the summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a temperate climate with adequate sunlight. Due to its ornamental value and potential for cultivation, it is sometimes grown in gardens and conservation areas."
