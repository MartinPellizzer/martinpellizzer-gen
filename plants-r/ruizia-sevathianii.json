    "intro": "Ruizia sevathianii, commonly known as the giant ruizia, is a striking tropical plant native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and large, palmate leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that are highly fragrant and attract various pollinators. Ruizia sevathianii thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for botanical gardens and conservation efforts."
