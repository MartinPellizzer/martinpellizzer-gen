    "intro": "Robinia pseudoacacia f. stricta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved false acacia, is a compact form of the black locust tree. It features narrower, more elongated leaves compared to the typical variety, with a darker green hue. The plant produces fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers in racemes during late spring. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that thrives in full sun and well-drained soils. This form is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its dense growth habit and attractive foliage."
