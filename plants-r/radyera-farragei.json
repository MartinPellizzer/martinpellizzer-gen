    "intro": "Radyera farragei, commonly known as the golden bell orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow flowers that resemble small bells, which bloom during the warmer months. The plant has a compact growth habit with linear, grass-like leaves and relies on specific fungal associations for nutrient uptake. Its habitat is highly specialized, requiring high humidity and filtered sunlight. Due to its limited distribution and threats from habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and is protected under Australian conservation laws."
