    "intro": "Rubus chlorostylus, commonly known as the green-stemmed blackberry, is a species of bramble native to parts of eastern North America. It is characterized by its slender, greenish stems and small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black in color. The plant produces compound leaves with three to five leaflets, and its flowers are white with five petals. It thrives in moist, wooded areas and is often found in the understory of forests. The berries are edible but are generally less palatable than those of other Rubus species."
