    "intro": "Ranunculus alpestris var. traunfellneri, commonly known as the Traunfellner's buttercup, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its bright yellow, cup-shaped flowers with numerous stamens and a central pistil. The plant typically grows in rocky or grassy habitats at high altitudes. Its leaves are palmately lobed and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often found in botanical gardens and alpine flora displays."
