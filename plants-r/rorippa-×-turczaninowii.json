    "intro": "Rorippa \u00d7 turczaninowii, commonly known as the hybrid watercress, is a member of the Brassicaceae family and is characterized by its aquatic or semi-aquatic growth habit. It typically features small, alternate, ovate leaves that are often submerged or floating, with a peppery aroma similar to its parent species. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which are pollinated by insects. Its seeds are small and capsule-like, dispersing through water or wind. This hybrid is often found in moist environments such as ponds, streams, and wetlands, where it plays a role in aquatic ecosystems."
