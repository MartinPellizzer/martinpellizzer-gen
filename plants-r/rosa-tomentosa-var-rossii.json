    "intro": "Rosa tomentosa var. rossii, commonly known as the Ross's woolly rose, is a shrub-like species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly gray foliage and clusters of fragrant, pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters and has thorny stems, which are typical of many rose species. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic in shape and are covered in fine, white hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens for its beauty and hardiness."
