    "intro": "Rebutia chrysacantha var. iseliniana, commonly known as the Iselin's golden rebutia, is a compact, low-growing cactus native to arid regions of South America. It features a spherical or slightly elongated stem with a smooth, pale green surface covered in fine, white to pale blue spines. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and early summer, which bloom at the axils of the spines. It is well adapted to full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its slow growth and compact form, it is often cultivated as a decorative and low-maintenance succulent."
