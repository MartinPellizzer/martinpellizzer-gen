    "intro": "Rubus dispectus, commonly known as the alpine blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its erect or scrambling growth habit and produces small, dark berries that are typically edible. The plant has compound leaves with three to five leaflets, and its flowers are usually white or pale pink. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species in many parts of its range."
