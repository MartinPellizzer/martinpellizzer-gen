    "intro": "Rosa agrestis var. ampelophila, commonly known as the creeping wild rose, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, trailing stems that often form dense mats on the ground. The plant produces small, fragrant pink or white flowers, typically in clusters, during the summer months. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets, and it has thorny stems that provide structural support. This variety is often found in woodland edges, meadows, and disturbed soils, where it thrives in partial shade to full sun."
