    "intro": "Ranunculus questieri, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada buttercup, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of California and Nevada. It is characterized by its showy, yellow to orange flowers with five to eight petals and a hairy, glandular stem. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky habitats and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Its leaves are trifoliate, with lobed segments, and it produces small, greenish-yellow sepals that surround the flower. Ranunculus questieri is a perennial species that thrives in cooler climates and is adapted to the high-altitude environment of its native range."
