    "intro": "Rhagadiolus rhagadiolus, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a species of flowering plant in the family Fabaceae. It is native to parts of Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya and Tanzania. The plant is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and its ability to thrive in arid environments. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and rich reddish color, making it a sought-after material in traditional crafts. However, due to overharvesting, it is now considered endangered and protected in many regions."
