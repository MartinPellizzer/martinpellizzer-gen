    "intro": "Roebuckiella cheilocarpa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved roebuckiella, is a rare flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves and thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. It is often found in rocky outcrops and along riverbanks, where it forms dense clusters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
