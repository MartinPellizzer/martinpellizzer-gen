    "intro": "Ribes californicum var. californicum, commonly known as the California gooseberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters and features compound leaves with 5 to 9 leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are followed by edible berries that mature to a red or orange color. These berries are often consumed by birds and small mammals, aiding in seed dispersal. The shrub thrives in well-drained soils and is commonly found in chaparral and coastal scrub habitats."
