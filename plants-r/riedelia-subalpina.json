    "intro": "Riedelia subalpina, commonly known as the alpine riedelia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its herbaceous growth habit and hairy stems. The plant typically produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from pink to white, often blooming in late summer. Riedelia subalpina thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, and it is adapted to cold, arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
