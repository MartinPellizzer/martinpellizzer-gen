    "intro": "Ranunculus flexicaulis, commonly known as the flexible buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features delicate, lobed leaves and showy yellow flowers with five petals, typical of the Ranunculaceae family. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream sides. Its stems are flexible and often arching, which helps it withstand wind and water. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain multiple seeds, aiding in its propagation."
