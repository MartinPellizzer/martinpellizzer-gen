    "intro": "Rumex obtusifolius var. densiflorus, commonly known as the dense-flowered dock, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features basal leaves that are broad and rounded, with a wavy margin, and a reddish or purple stem. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in dense, terminal inflorescences. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. The species is notable for its ability to tolerate wet conditions and its potential use in phytoremediation due to its heavy metal uptake capabilities."
