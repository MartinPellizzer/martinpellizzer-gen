    "intro": "Rubus mollissimus, commonly known as the silky raspberry, is a species of shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and trifoliate leaves with a soft, silvery underside. The plant produces small, red, edible fruits that are similar to raspberries but have a distinct, slightly tart flavor. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The silky raspberry is valued for both its ornamental appeal and its culinary uses."
