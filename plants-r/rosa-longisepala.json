    "intro": "Rosa longisepala, commonly known as the long-sepaled rose, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically range in color from white to pink. The plant has pinnately compound leaves and produces fragrant, five-petaled blooms. It thrives in cool, humid climates and is often found in forested areas. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is less common than other rose species."
