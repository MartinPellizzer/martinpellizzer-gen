    "intro": "Rumex crispus var. trigranulatus, commonly known as the three-ridged sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its serrated, crinkled leaves. It belongs to the Polygonaceae family and is native to temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils such as along roadsides or in wet meadows. Its leaves are edible but contain oxalic acid, which can be toxic in large quantities. The flowers are small and greenish, often clustered in dense inflorescences."
