    "intro": "Rhinocidium raniferum, commonly known as the horned bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple, often with a yellow or orange throat. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in alpine environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, seed-like fruits that are dispersed by wind. Rhinocidium raniferum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil."
