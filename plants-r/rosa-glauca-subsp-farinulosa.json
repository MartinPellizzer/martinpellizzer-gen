    "intro": "Rosa glauca subsp. farinulosa, commonly known as the Farinulosa rose, is a subspecies native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, rough texture. The plant produces fragrant, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically alternate and have a serrated margin, while the stems are often woody and covered in a whitish, powdery coating. This subspecies is well adapted to harsh, alpine environments and is often found in rocky soils at high elevations."
