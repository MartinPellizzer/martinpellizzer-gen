    "intro": "Rumohra assamica, commonly known as the Assam grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern Himalayas. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. This plant is adapted to grow in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest understories. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats. Rumohra assamica plays an important ecological role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
