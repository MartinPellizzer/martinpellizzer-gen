It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and clusters of fragrant, semi-double pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are pinnately compound, with ovate to lanceolate leaflets that are often covered in a fine layer of white pubescence. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its showy blooms and historical significance. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy addition to temperate climates."
