It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to deep pink. The plant produces oval, leathery leaves with a slightly serrated edge, and its flowers typically bloom in late spring to early summer. It is well adapted to rocky and dry soils, making it a hardy species suitable for cultivation in temperate climates. The Roman rose is often valued for its ornamental appeal and historical significance in traditional medicine."
