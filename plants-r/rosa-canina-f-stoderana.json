    "intro": "Rosa canina f. stoderana, commonly known as the St\u00f6derana rose, is a rare and distinct form of the dog rose. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and unique floral features, including pale yellow to orange petals. The plant produces small, red hips that are similar to those of the common dog rose but may have a slightly different coloration. It is typically found in specific microhabitats, often in limestone soils, and is considered a botanical curiosity. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
