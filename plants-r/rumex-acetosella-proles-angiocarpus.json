    "intro": "Rumex acetosella proles angiocarpus, commonly known as sour dock, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North America. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in dense clusters during the spring and summer months. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Rumex acetosella is often found in moist soils, such as along stream banks and in wet meadows."
