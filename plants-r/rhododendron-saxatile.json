    "intro": "Rhododendron saxatile, commonly known as the alpine rhododendron, is a hardy evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, showcasing its adaptability to harsh environmental conditions. The plant features dense, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence, which helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, appearing in clusters and blooming in late spring to early summer. Rhododendron saxatile is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in challenging alpine habitats."
