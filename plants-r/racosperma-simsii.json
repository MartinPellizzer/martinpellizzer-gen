    "intro": "Racosperma simsii, commonly known as the yellow wattle, is a flowering plant native to eastern Australia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Racosperma simsii plays an important ecological role by fixing nitrogen in the soil, supporting biodiversity in its native habitat."
