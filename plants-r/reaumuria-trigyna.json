    "intro": "Reaumuria trigyna, commonly known as the three-stamen saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia and the Mediterranean. It is a low-growing perennial shrub with woody stems and small, fleshy leaves adapted to drought conditions. The plant produces yellow flowers with three stamens, typical of the Caryophyllaceae family. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to survive in poor soils and extreme climates. Reaumuria trigyna plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
