    "intro": "Rumicastrum vernicosum, commonly known as the velvetleaf or velvetleaf nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, waxy leaves that often have a velvety texture, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by orange or red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Its leaves and stems contain alkaloids, making it a plant with both ornamental and potentially hazardous properties. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodland areas and along stream banks."
