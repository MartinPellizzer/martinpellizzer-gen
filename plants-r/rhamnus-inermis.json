    "intro": "Rhamnus inermis, commonly known as the smooth buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters and features small, oval-shaped leaves that are dark green on top and lighter on the underside. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by black, berry-like fruits in the fall. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, and the plant is often found in rocky or dry soils. Rhamnus inermis is adapted to withstand drought and is relatively hardy in temperate climates."
