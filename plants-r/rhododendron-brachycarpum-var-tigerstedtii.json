It features dense, leathery leaves that are typically dark green with a slight waxiness. The plant produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to red, which bloom in early spring. It prefers acidic, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and long-lasting blooms."
