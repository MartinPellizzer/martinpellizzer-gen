    "intro": "Rostkovia clandestina, commonly known as the hidden rostkovia, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to specific regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that bloom in late spring, typically in shades of white and pink. The plant has a short lifespan, often completing its life cycle within a single growing season. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, such as woodlands and meadows, and is often difficult to locate due to its inconspicuous appearance. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, Rostkovia clandestina is considered a conservation concern."
