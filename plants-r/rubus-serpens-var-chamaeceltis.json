    "intro": "Rubus serpens var. chamaeceltis, commonly known as creeping blackberry, is a low-growing shrub native to the eastern United States. It features trailing stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats of foliage. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in the spring, followed by edible berries that ripen to a dark red or black color. Its leaves are typically trifoliate, with three leaflets that are serrated along the edges. This variety is well adapted to moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas."
