    "intro": "Rhexia heterophylla, commonly known as the variableleaf bluetail, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the heather family (Ericaceae) and is characterized by its showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils in woodland habitats, often forming dense colonies. Its leaves vary in shape and size, which contributes to its common name. Rhexia heterophylla is an important nectar source for pollinators and is valued for its ornamental qualities in gardens."
