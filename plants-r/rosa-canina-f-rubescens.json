It is characterized by its distinctive red berries, which contrast with the typical orange or yellow fruits of the species. The plant produces fragrant pink or white flowers in spring, followed by the development of its characteristic red fruit. It is a shrub that thrives in temperate climates and is often found in hedgerows and woodland edges. The red-fruited form is valued for its ornamental qualities and is also used in horticulture for its aesthetic appeal."
