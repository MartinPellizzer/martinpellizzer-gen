    "intro": "Rosa jundzillii var. eminens, commonly known as the Armenian rose, is a rare and ornamental shrub native to the high altitudes of the Caucasus region. It features dense, thornless stems and produces clusters of fragrant, pale pink to white flowers in late summer. The plant has small, elliptical leaves with a slightly hairy texture, and its flowers are often borne on long pedicels. It is well adapted to cold climates and requires well-drained soil to thrive. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a botanical curiosity and is often cultivated in specialized gardens."
