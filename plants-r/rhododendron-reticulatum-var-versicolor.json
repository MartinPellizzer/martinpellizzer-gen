    "intro": "Rhododendron reticulatum var. versicolor, commonly known as the Variable Rhododendron, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern Himalayas. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink, red, and purple, depending on environmental conditions. The plant has lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its variable flower colors, which create a dynamic display throughout the blooming season."
