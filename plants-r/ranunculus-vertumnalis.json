    "intro": "Ranunculus vertumnalis, commonly known as the turnip-rooted buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to yellow and pink. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with alternate, trifoliate leaves that are covered in fine hairs. Its root system is tuberous, which allows it to survive in temperate climates and regrow each spring. Ranunculus vertumnalis prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges."
