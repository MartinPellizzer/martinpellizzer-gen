It features bright yellow flowers with five to seven petals, typically appearing in early spring. The plant has a creeping habit, with stolons that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. Its leaves are palmately divided and have a distinctive shiny appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks."
