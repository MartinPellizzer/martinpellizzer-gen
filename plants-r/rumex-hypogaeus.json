    "intro": "Rumex hypogaeus, commonly known as the underground sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its subterranean growth habit, with most of its biomass developing underground in the form of rhizomes and tubers. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or reddish in color, and it is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are usually heart-shaped and have a distinctive sour taste due to the presence of oxalic acid. Despite its medicinal uses in some traditional systems, it is not commonly cultivated for agricultural purposes."
