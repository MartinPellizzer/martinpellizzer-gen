    "intro": "Rubus ambifarius var. longistylis, commonly known as the long-styled blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to parts of eastern North America. It is characterized by its dark purple to black berries, which are typically larger and more elongated than those of the typical species. The plant produces compound leaves with three to five leaflets, and its flowers have five sepals and five petals. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. This variant is valued for its edible fruits and is sometimes cultivated for its flavor and yield."
