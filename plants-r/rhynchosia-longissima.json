    "intro": "Rhynchosia longissima, commonly known as the long-stemmed cowpea, is a climbing legume native to tropical regions of Africa and South America. It features slender, serpentine stems that can grow up to several meters in length, supported by tendrils that aid in climbing. The plant produces small, yellow flowers followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing edible seeds. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three ovate leaflets, and it thrives in warm, humid climates. Rhynchosia longissima is valued both for its nutritional seeds and its ornamental appeal due to its unique growth habit."
