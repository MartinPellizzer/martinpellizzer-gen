    "intro": "Robinia pseudoacacia monophylla-fastigiata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved false acacia, is a deciduous tree characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. It produces cylindrical, yellowish-pink flower clusters in early summer, which are highly attractive to pollinators. The tree's bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age, and its wood is strong and durable. It is native to the southeastern United States but has been introduced to other regions for ornamental purposes. However, it is considered an invasive species in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
