    "intro": "Rubus horridus var. humifusus, commonly known as the rough bramble or creeping raspberry, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its thorny stems and trifoliate leaves, which are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, aggregated fruits known as raspberries, which are edible and have a tart flavor. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils. This variety is notable for its hardy nature and ability to spread through both runners and seeds."
