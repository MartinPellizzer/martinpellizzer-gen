    "intro": "Ranunculus nepalinus, commonly known as the Nepalese buttercup, is a flowering plant native to the Himalayan regions of Nepal and northern India. It is a herbaceous perennial with showy, yellow flowers that are typically surrounded by five to seven sepals. The plant has a fibrous root system and thrives in moist, well-drained soils at high altitudes. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a hairy surface that helps reduce water loss in its cool, mountainous habitat. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
