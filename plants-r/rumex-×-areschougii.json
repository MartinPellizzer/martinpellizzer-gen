    "intro": "Rumex \u00d7 areschougii, commonly known as the hybrid sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Polygonaceae family. It is a naturally occurring hybrid between Rumex acetosa (sorrel) and Rumex acetobatus (water sorrel), resulting in a plant with distinctive botanical features. The leaves are typically heart-shaped with a waxy surface and a reddish or purple underside, which helps in identifying the species. It produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, and the plant is often found in moist, calcareous soils near water bodies. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and wetland restoration projects."
