    "intro": "Ranunculus spathulilobus, commonly known as the broad-lobed buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features showy, bright yellow flowers with five to nine petals, often with a distinctive central stigma. The plant has finely divided, trifoliate leaves that are typically hairy and have a basal rosette growth habit. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
