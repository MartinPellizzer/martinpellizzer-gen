    "intro": "Rubus tholeyroniamus, commonly known as the Tholeyronia blackberry, is a species of shrub belonging to the Rosaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central America, where it thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils. The plant produces small, dark purple berries that are typically harvested in late summer. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and its stems are covered in dense, prickly bracts. The plant is valued for both its ornamental appeal and its edible fruit, though it is less commonly cultivated than other blackberry species."
