    "intro": "Ruellia foetida, commonly known as stinking roselite, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its dark green, oval-shaped leaves and clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant produces small, round fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Ruellia foetida thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Its strong, unpleasant odor is a notable feature, especially when the leaves are crushed."
