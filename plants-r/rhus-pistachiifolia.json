    "intro": "Rhus pistachiifolia, commonly known as the smooth sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern and central United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and typically have 11 to 31 leaflets. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by red, fuzzy berries that are a key feature of its fruiting stage. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained soils and full sun. Rhus pistachiifolia is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and is also important in ecological settings as a food source for wildlife."
