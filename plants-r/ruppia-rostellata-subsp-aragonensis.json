    "intro": "Ruppia rostellata subsp. aragonensis, commonly known as the Aragon water plant, is a submerged aquatic plant native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in brackish and freshwater environments, such as estuaries and coastal lagoons. The plant has narrow, ribbon-like leaves that are arranged in a spiral pattern around its stem. It produces small, yellow flowers that are pollinated by wind, and its seeds are dispersed by water currents. This subspecies is important for maintaining aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various water organisms."
