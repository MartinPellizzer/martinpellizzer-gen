    "intro": "Rogiera ligustroides, commonly known as the goldenrod, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its bright yellow inflorescences, which consist of numerous small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. Its leaves are alternate, lanceolate, and often have a rough texture. Rogiera ligustroides plays an important role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies due to its abundant nectar-rich flowers."
