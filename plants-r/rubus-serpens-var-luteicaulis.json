    "intro": "Rubus serpens var. luteicaulis, commonly known as the yellow-stemmed blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to parts of North America. It is a trailing shrub that produces small, edible berries, though they are often less flavorful than other blackberry varieties. The plant is characterized by its yellowish stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
