    "intro": "Rosa canina f. anthocyanea, commonly known as the purple-hipped dogrose, is a botanical variant of the common dogrose. It is characterized by its distinctive deep purple or nearly black hips, which contrast with its pale pink to white flowers. The plant typically grows in open woodlands and scrublands, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it produces thorny stems typical of the Rosa genus. This form is less commonly cultivated than the standard Rosa canina but is valued for its ornamental and historical significance."
