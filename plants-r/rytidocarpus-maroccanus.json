    "intro": "Rytidocarpus maroccanus, commonly known as the Moroccan cycad, is a unique cycad species native to Morocco. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnate leaves that can reach up to 2 meters in length. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils. Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
