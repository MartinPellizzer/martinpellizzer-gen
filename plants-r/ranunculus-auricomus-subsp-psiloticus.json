    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus subsp. psiloticus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features delicate, yellow flowers with five broadly ovate petals and a prominent yellow center. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges. Its leaves are palmately divided with a distinctive, finely toothed margin. The subspecies is distinguished by its narrower leaves and more elongated petals compared to the typical form of Ranunculus auricomus."
