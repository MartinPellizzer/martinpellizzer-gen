    "intro": "Rosa fenestrata, commonly known as the fenestrated rose, is a species of shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, lobed leaves that often have a fenestrated or pierced appearance. The plant produces fragrant, pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in partial to full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and seasonal interest throughout the year."
