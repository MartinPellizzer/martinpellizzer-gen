    "intro": "Rubus caesius f. pietrosensis, commonly known as the alpine blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to high-altitude regions of Europe. It is characterized by its small, dark red to black berries that are typically smaller than those of the standard Rubus caesius. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, mountainous climates. It has a shrub-like growth habit with thorny stems and trifoliate leaves. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological adaptations and limited distribution."
