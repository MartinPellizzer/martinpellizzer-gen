    "intro": "Ricinus communis f. atrophoeniceus, commonly known as the red leaf castor, is a rare and striking variant of the common castor plant. It is characterized by its vibrant red and purple foliage, which contrasts sharply with its typical green leaves. The plant retains the typical spiny seed capsules of Ricinus communis, containing toxic seeds. It is primarily cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and botanical collections. Due to its limited distribution and unique appearance, it is considered a valuable specimen in horticulture and plant conservation."
