    "intro": "Rosa pimpinellifolia subvar. megalacantha, commonly known as the giant thorned rock rose, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and spiny stems, which provide protection against herbivores. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant pink or white flowers in the spring, followed by red-orange hips that are edible and rich in vitamin C. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in dry, sunny conditions."
