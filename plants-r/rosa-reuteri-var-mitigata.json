    "intro": "Rosa reuteri var. mitigata, commonly known as the pink sandalwood rose, is a compact, shrub-like species native to the Canary Islands. It features small, fragrant flowers that range in color from pale pink to white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, glossy leaves and produces small, red, berry-like fruits that contain seeds. It is well-suited for rock gardens and coastal areas due to its drought tolerance and salt resistance. Its ornamental value comes from its delicate flowers and unique foliage structure."
