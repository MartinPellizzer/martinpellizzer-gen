    "intro": "Ribes grossularia var. pubescens, commonly known as the downy currant, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its pubescent (hairy) stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits called drupes, which are typically red or black when mature. These fruits are edible and are often used in jams and desserts. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to colder climates, making it a hardy ornamental and edible plant."
