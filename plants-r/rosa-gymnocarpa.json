    "intro": "Rosa gymnocarpa, commonly known as the naked-seed rose, is a species of shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, round fruits called hips, which are typically hairy and contain a single seed. Rosa gymnocarpa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its beauty and historical significance. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both horticultural and ecological studies."
