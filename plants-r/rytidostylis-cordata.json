    "intro": "Rytidostylis cordata, commonly known as the broad-leafed pandan, is a species of flowering plant in the family Pandanaceae. It is characterized by its broad, sword-shaped leaves that are often used in traditional cooking and herbal medicine. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in wetlands and swampy areas. Its rhizomatous stem system allows it to spread and form dense mats, which can help stabilize soil in wet environments. The flowers are small and clustered, often hidden among the foliage, and are pollinated by insects."
