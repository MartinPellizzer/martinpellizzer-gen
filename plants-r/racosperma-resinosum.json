    "intro": "Racosperma resinosum, commonly known as the resinous acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its rigid, often glandular stems and leaves that are typically narrow and opposite. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in dense, cylindrical clusters, which are typical of the Fabaceae family. Its small, leathery pods contain seeds that are dispersed by wind. Racosperma resinosum is often found in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments."
