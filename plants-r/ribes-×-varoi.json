    "intro": "Ribes \u00d7 varoi, commonly known as the hybrid currant, is a deciduous shrub that belongs to the genus Ribes in the family Grossulariaceae. It is a natural hybrid between Ribes nigrum (black currant) and Ribes rubrum (red currant), resulting in a plant that exhibits traits of both parents. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptic, with serrated margins, and the flowers are small, clustered, and usually pink or white in color. The plant produces edible berries that are similar in taste to its parent species, often used in jams and jellies. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental and culinary value."
