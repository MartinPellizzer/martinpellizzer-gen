    "intro": "Rumex bryhnii, commonly known as the Norwegian dock, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to northern Europe. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in wet meadows, riverbanks, and other damp habitats. The plant features broad, arrow-shaped leaves with a waxy surface and produces small, greenish flowers in clusters during the summer months. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense stands in suitable environments. The species is valued for its hardy nature and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
