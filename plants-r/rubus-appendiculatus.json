    "intro": "Rubus appendiculatus, commonly known as the alpine raspberry, is a species of bramble native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit, with thorny stems and compound leaves that are typically trifoliate. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are usually red or yellow in color, which are edible and have a tart flavor. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its hardy nature, it plays an important role in stabilizing soil in high-altitude ecosystems."
