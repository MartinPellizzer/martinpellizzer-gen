    "intro": "Rhamnus longifolia, commonly known as the longleaf buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and riverbanks. The plant features small, elliptical leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Its flowers are yellowish-green and appear in clusters, followed by small, dark blue berries that are a food source for birds and small mammals. The bark is dark brown to black and becomes fissured with age, contributing to its ornamental value."
