    "intro": "Radiogrammitis tehoruensis, commonly known as the Te Horo fern, is a rare and endemic species found in New Zealand. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rock surfaces or in crevices. Its spores are dispersed through wind, and it plays a significant role in the ecological balance of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species."
