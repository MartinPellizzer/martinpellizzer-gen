    "intro": "Ribes cereum var. pedicellare, commonly known as the woolly currant, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its dense, glandular, white to grayish hairs that cover its stems, leaves, and flowers, giving it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically clustered in racemes, followed by edible, red berries that are often used in jams and jellies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
