    "intro": "Rhodanthe manglesii var. sanguinea, commonly known as the red-flowered rhodanthe, is a striking member of the daisy family native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its vibrant red or pink flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows as a herbaceous perennial, reaching heights of up to 1 meter, with lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long-lasting blooms and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
