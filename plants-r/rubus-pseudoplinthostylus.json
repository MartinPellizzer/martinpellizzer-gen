    "intro": "Rubus pseudoplinthostylus, commonly known as the New Zealand bramble, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is native to New Zealand and is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of white to pink flowers. The plant produces edible berries that are typically small and tart. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including forests and shrublands, and is well adapted to the temperate climate of its native region. Due to its hardy nature, it can be both a valuable plant for ecological systems and a challenging weed in agricultural settings."
