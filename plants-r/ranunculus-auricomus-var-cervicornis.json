It features showy, yellow flowers with a distinctive, palmately divided leaf structure. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are deeply lobed and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
