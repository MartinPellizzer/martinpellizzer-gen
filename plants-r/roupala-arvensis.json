    "intro": "Roupala arvensis, commonly known as the field roupala, is a small shrub native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and fields. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are usually oval or elliptical in shape. Its small, yellowish flowers appear in clusters and are followed by small, three-lobed fruits. Roupala arvensis is often considered a weed due to its rapid growth and ability to colonize new areas."
