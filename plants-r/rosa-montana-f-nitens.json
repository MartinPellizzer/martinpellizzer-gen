    "intro": "Rosa montana f. nitens, commonly known as the white mountain rose, is a hybrid rose species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of white, semi-double flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces dark green, leathery leaves with a slightly serrated edge, and its stems are covered in thorns. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a container plant. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and hardiness in cooler climates."
