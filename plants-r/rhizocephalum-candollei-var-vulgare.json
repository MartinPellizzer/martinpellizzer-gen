    "intro": "Rhizocephalum candollei var. vulgare, commonly known as the common root-feeding plant, is a species of flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its fibrous root system that forms dense mats on the soil surface, aiding in soil stabilization. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellow in color. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. This variant is widely distributed and is often found in disturbed soils, making it an important pioneer species in ecological succession."
