    "intro": "Rheum australe, commonly known as the Australian rhubarb, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Australia. It features large, waxy, and often colorful leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in spring, which are followed by elongated, fleshy fruits known as rhubarb stalks. These stalks are edible and are often used in cooking, though they are typically cooked due to their tart flavor. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along watercourses."
