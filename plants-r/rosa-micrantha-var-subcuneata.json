    "intro": "Rosa micrantha var. subcuneata, commonly known as the narrow-angled rock rose, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features slender, arching stems that often grow along rocky substrates, adapted to harsh, alpine environments. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink to white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a serrated margin, with a leathery texture that helps reduce water loss. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a hardy landscape plant."
