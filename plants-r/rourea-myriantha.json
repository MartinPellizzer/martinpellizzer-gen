    "intro": "Rourea myriantha, commonly known as the velvetleaf rourea, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that give it a velvety appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Rourea myriantha is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks."
