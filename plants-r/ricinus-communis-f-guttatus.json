    "intro": "Ricinus communis f. guttatus, commonly known as the curly leaf castor oil plant, is a variant of the castor oil plant characterized by its uniquely curled and twisted leaves. This ornamental plant is native to tropical regions and is often cultivated for its striking foliage rather than its seeds. The leaves are typically dark green with a velvety texture and exhibit a broad range of curling patterns. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. While it is not typically used for oil production, it is valued in horticulture for its aesthetic appeal."
