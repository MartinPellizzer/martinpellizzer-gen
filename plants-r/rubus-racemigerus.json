It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and the production of edible, dark purple berries. The plant has compound leaves with serrated edges and produces small, white flowers in clusters. Its berries are often used in jams and pies, though they are generally less sweet than other blackberry varieties. Botanically, it is part of the Rubus genus, which includes many species of brambles and raspberries."
