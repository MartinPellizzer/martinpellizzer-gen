    "intro": "Rubus sepium, commonly known as the common blackberry, is a species of bramble native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters, featuring thorny stems and alternate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces aggregate fruits composed of small, juicy drupelets that are typically dark purple to black in color. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers moist, well-drained conditions. Rubus sepium is valued for its edible fruits and is often found in hedgerows, woodlands, and along riverbanks."
