    "intro": "Rumex \u00d7 niesslii, commonly known as the hybrid sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant that belongs to the Polygonaceae family. It is a natural hybrid between Rumex acetosa (common sorrel) and Rumex acetobipinatus (broad-leaved sorrel). The plant typically features broad, heart-shaped leaves with a reddish or purple coloration on the veins, and it produces small, greenish flowers in clusters. It thrives in moist, fertile soils and is often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and wetland restoration projects."
