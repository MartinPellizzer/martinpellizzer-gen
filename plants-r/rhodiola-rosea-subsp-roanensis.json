    "intro": "Rhodiola rosea subsp. roanensis, commonly known as the Roan rose, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and clusters of small, pinkish-red flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in alpine and subalpine environments, often growing at high altitudes where conditions are harsh. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from poor, rocky soils. Rhodiola rosea subsp. roanensis is valued for its potential adaptogenic properties and is used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
