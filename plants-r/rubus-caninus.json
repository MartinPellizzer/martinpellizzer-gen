    "intro": "Rubus caninus, commonly known as the dog rose, is a species of bramble native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant produces red or orange berries that are edible but often have a tart flavor. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three leaflets that are serrated along the edges. Rubus caninus is often found in woodland edges, hedgerows, and disturbed soils, where it thrives in partial shade to full sun."
