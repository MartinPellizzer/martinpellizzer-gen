    "intro": "Rebutia senilis var. xanthocarpa, commonly known as the yellow fruiting rebutia, is a succulent plant native to South America. It is characterized by its compact, rounded shape and thick, ribbed stems that store water. The plant produces small, yellow flowers followed by orange to red fruits that contain seeds. Its leaves are typically green with a waxy coating, and it thrives in well-draining soil and full sun. It is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental appeal."
