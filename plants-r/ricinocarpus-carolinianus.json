    "intro": "Ricinocarpus carolinianus, commonly known as the Carolina thimbleberry, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, berry-like fruits that are edible when ripe, though they are often described as having a tart flavor. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The leaves are simple, alternate, and have a slightly serrated edge, contributing to its distinct appearance."
