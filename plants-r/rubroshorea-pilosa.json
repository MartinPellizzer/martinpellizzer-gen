It is characterized by its rough, hairy bark and broad, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or red in color, which bloom in clusters. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
