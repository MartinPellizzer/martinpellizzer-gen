    "intro": "Ruellia tuberosa var. occidentalis, commonly known as the Western tuberous ruellia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its upright, branching stems and clusters of blue to violet tubular flowers. The plant produces tuberous roots that help it survive in dry conditions, making it drought-tolerant. Its foliage is typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
