    "intro": "Relbunium hirtum f. glabriflora, commonly known as the glabrous-flowered form of the hairy bellflower, is a botanical variant characterized by its reduced leaf pubescence and smoother floral structures compared to the typical species. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family, known for its bell-shaped flowers, and is native to specific regions in Europe. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and thrives in woodland or grassland habitats. Its flowers, which are usually blue or violet, bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphological traits and ecological adaptations."
