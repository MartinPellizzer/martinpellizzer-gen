    "intro": "Roebelia, commonly known as the \"everlasting\" or \"ghost flower,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Gesneriaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and Madagascar, where it thrives in shaded, moist environments. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink, purple, or white, and they bloom in clusters during the rainy season. Roebelia species are often cultivated as ornamental plants due to their delicate appearance and long-lasting blooms. They require well-draining soil and consistent moisture to flourish."
