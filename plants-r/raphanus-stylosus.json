    "intro": "Raphanus stylosus, commonly known as the slender radish, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes other well-known species such as cabbage and mustard. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30\u201360 centimeters, featuring lobed leaves and yellow flowers that bloom from summer to autumn. Its root system is relatively small and not as economically important as that of the common radish. Raphanus stylosus is often found in disturbed soils and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
