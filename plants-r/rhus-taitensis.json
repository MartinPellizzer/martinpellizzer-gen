    "intro": "Rhus taitensis, commonly known as the Taiti sumac, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of the Pacific. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically pinnate with serrated margins. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, followed by red, fleshy berries that are often eaten by birds. Rhus taitensis thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or lowland areas. Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and ornamental contexts."
