    "intro": "Robinia pseudoacacia f. myrtifolia, commonly known as the myrtifolia false acacia, is a botanical variant of the black locust tree. It is characterized by its distinctive leaves, which are narrower and more elongated compared to the typical form, often with a slight reddish or bronze hue on the underside. The flowers are usually pale yellow and appear in clustered panicles, blooming in early summer. This form is less common in cultivation and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits. It is native to the southeastern United States and thrives in well-drained soils."
