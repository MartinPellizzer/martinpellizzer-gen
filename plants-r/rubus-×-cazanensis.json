    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 cazanensis, commonly known as the C\u0103z\u0103na raspberry, is a hybrid species within the Rubus genus, characterized by its thorny stems and aggregate fruits. It is native to the Carpathian Mountains in Romania and is known for its edible, red to black berries that are often used in local cuisine and traditional medicine. The plant typically grows in woodland and shrubland habitats, preferring well-drained soils and partial shade. Its botanical features include trifoliate leaves with serrated edges and showy white or pink flowers that bloom in the spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
