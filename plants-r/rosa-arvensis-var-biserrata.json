It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, fragrant pink or white flowers. The leaves are compound, with serrated edges that give the plant its specific name, *biserrata*. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. This species is notable for its adaptability and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
