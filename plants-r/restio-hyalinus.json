    "intro": "Restio hyalinus, commonly known as the silver restio, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with long, narrow leaves that are often covered in a silvery or whitish bloom, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, white to pale green flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or wetland environments. Restio hyalinus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticulture for its unique foliage."
