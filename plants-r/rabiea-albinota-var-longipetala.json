    "intro": "Rabiea albinota var. longipetala, commonly known as the long-petaled white orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, white, fragrant flowers with elongated petals and a distinctive, narrow lip. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, preferring well-drained soil and high humidity. Its leaves are broad and glossy, often with a waxy coating to retain moisture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in the wild."
