    "intro": "Rubus glaucellus microgene glaucispinus, commonly known as the glaucous blackberry, is a shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically covered in a whitish, waxy bloom. The plant has compound leaves with serrated edges and thorny stems typical of the Rubus genus. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands and along streambanks. The berries are edible but can be quite tart, and the plant is valued for both its ornamental and ecological benefits."
