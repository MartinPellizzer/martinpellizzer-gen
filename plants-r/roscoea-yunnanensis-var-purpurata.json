It belongs to the Zingiberaceae family, which includes gingers, and is characterized by its tall, leafy stems and showy inflorescences. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink to purple, often with a red or orange hue at the base. Its foliage consists of large, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, aiding in water retention in its high-altitude habitat. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique floral display."
