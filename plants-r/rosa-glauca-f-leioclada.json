    "intro": "Rosa glauca f. leioclada, commonly known as the blue rose or blue-flowered Rosa glauca, is a horticultural form of the species Rosa glauca. It is characterized by its striking blue or bluish-pink flowers, which are a result of a genetic mutation affecting pigmentation. The plant is a deciduous shrub with thorny stems and compound leaves, typical of many rose species. It thrives in temperate climates and requires well-drained soil and full sun for optimal growth. This cultivar is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique coloration."
