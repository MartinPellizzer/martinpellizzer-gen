    "intro": "Ridsdalea alba, commonly known as the white ridsdalea, is a rare and striking member of the Araliaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of southern China and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery-white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in late spring, adding to its ornamental appeal. Its unique appearance and limited distribution make it a sought-after specimen in botanical gardens and among plant enthusiasts. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Ridsdalea alba is considered endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
