    "intro": "Rumex daiwoo, commonly known as the Korean sorrel, is a perennial herb native to East Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive sour taste due to its high oxalic acid content. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its flowers are small and clustered in loose spikes, often greenish or reddish in color. Rumex daiwoo is valued both for its culinary uses and as a ornamental plant in gardens."
