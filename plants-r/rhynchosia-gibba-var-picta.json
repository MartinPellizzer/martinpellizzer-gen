It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive, hairy, and often speckled pods.

Its leaves are trifoliate, with three oval-shaped leaflets, and the plant is often cultivated for its nutritional value. The varietal name \"picta\" refers to the unique, colorful markings on its pods, which can range from green to reddish-brown."
