    "intro": "Rubus radula var. bloxamianus, commonly known as Bloxam's bramble, is a variant of the common bramble species found in the British Isles. It is a shrub characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces edible berries that are typically red or black in color, though they are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. It thrives in woodland edges, hedgerows, and other moist, shaded environments. Botanically, it is notable for its hairy leaves and its role in supporting local wildlife, including insects and birds."
