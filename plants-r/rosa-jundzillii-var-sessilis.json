    "intro": "Rosa jundzillii var. sessilis, commonly known as the Kashmir rose, is a rare and ornamental shrub native to the Himalayan regions of Pakistan and India. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and clusters of small, fragrant pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are dark green, glossy, and oval-shaped, with serrated edges. The plant is valued for its hardiness and ability to thrive in cooler, high-altitude environments. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and limited distribution, making it a subject of interest in horticultural and botanical studies."
