    "intro": "Roettlera capsularis, commonly known as the red sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and vibrant red flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves, and it produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in the spring. Roettlera capsularis is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
