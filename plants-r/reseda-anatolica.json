    "intro": "Reseda anatolica, commonly known as Anatolian rattlebox, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Turkey. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae and is characterized by its small, yellow or white flowers arranged in racemes. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and shrublands. Its leaves are alternate, linear, and often hairy, while its fruit is a dry, segmented capsule that splits open to release the seeds. Reseda anatolica is also valued for its historical use in traditional medicine and as a source of natural dyes."
