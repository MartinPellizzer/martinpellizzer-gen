    "intro": "Rubus foliosus microgene granitogenes, commonly known as the granitic raspberry, is a rare shrub native to rocky, acidic soils in mountainous regions. It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and trifoliate leaves, which are typical of the Rubus genus. The plant produces small, edible berries that are often used in local cuisines. Its adaptability to granitic substrates makes it an important species in ecological studies of soil tolerance. Due to habitat loss, it is currently listed as endangered in several regions."
