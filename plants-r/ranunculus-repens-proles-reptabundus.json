    "intro": "Ranunculus repens proles reptabundus, commonly known as the creeping buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its low-growing, spreading habit. It features trifoliate leaves with serrated edges and bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments such as wet meadows and stream banks. It has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread vegetatively and colonize new areas easily. However, it is considered invasive in many regions due to its rapid growth and competitive nature."
