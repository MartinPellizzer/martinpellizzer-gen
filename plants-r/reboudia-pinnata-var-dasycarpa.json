    "intro": "Reboudia pinnata var. dasycarpa, commonly known as the hairy-fruited arrowhead, is a tropical aquatic plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its arrow-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically greenish-white in color, and it produces fleshy, berry-like fruits that are clustered in groups. The species is valued in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life."
