    "intro": "Rubus caesius subsp. lajtnensis, commonly known as the Lajtnen raspberry, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of southeastern Europe. It is characterized by its erect growth habit and prickly stems, typical of many Rubus species. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red when mature, which are edible and have a tart flavor. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers sunny to partially shaded environments. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological adaptations and limited distribution."
