    "intro": "Rubus idaeus leucocarpa, commonly known as the white-fruited raspberry, is a variant of the raspberry plant characterized by its pale, almost white berries. This species belongs to the Rosaceae family and is native to certain regions of Asia, particularly China. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits composed of multiple achenes, which are the true seeds of the plant. Its flowers are typically pink or white, with five petals, and it has a trailing growth habit with thorny stems. The white-fruited raspberry is less commonly cultivated than other raspberry varieties but is valued for its unique appearance and flavor."
