    "intro": "Rubus praetextus, commonly known as the red-veined blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and thorny stems, which support its classification within the Rubus genus. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black in color when mature. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated margins and a distinctive red venation pattern. Rubus praetextus thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas."
