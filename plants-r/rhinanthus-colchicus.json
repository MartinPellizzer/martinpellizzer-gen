    "intro": "Rhinanthus colchicus, commonly known as the yellow rattle, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, commonly known as the broomrape family, and is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. It typically grows in grasslands and open habitats, often in association with grasses and other herbaceous plants. Its flowers are pollinated by bees and other insects, contributing to the ecological balance of its habitat."
