    "intro": "Rhynchospora waspamensis, commonly known as the Waspam sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Central America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, thriving in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its flowers are small and clustered in spikelets, and it plays a role in supporting local biodiversity by providing habitat and food for various insects. Rhynchospora waspamensis is of interest to botanists due to its ecological significance and unique adaptations to wetland ecosystems."
