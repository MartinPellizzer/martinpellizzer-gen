    "intro": "Rosa \u00d7 reversa var. laricetorum, commonly known as the Siberian peony rose, is a hybrid shrub native to the cold climates of Siberia and northern China. It is characterized by its vigorous growth, cold hardiness, and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. The plant produces large, showy flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, often with a distinct, almost peony-like bloom structure. Its foliage is dark green and dense, providing excellent ground cover. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and resilience in harsh environments."
