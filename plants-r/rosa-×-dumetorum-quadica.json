    "intro": "Rosa \u00d7 dumetorum quadica, commonly known as the alpine rose, is a hybrid shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense foliage, which helps it survive in harsh alpine environments. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and covered in fine, soft hairs, which provide insulation against cold temperatures. Rosa \u00d7 dumetorum quadica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover in high-altitude landscapes."
