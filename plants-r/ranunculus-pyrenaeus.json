    "intro": "Ranunculus pyrenaeus, commonly known as the Pyrenean buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula. It typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils and cool, moist environments. The plant features a basal rosette of heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges, and it produces showy yellow flowers with five to eight petals. It blooms from spring to early summer, and its flowers are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
