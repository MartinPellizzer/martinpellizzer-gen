It is characterized by its distinctive greenish-yellow fruits, which contrast with the typical red or orange hips of the species. The plant typically grows as a shrub with thorny stems and pinnate leaves. It produces fragrant pink or white flowers in spring, followed by its unique green fruits in autumn. This form is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal medicine."
