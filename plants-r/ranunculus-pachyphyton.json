    "intro": "Ranunculus pachyphyton, commonly known as the thick-leaved buttercup, is a striking perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range in color from white to deep yellow, often with a distinctive black or purple center. The plant features thick, waxy leaves that are typically lobed or divided, adapted to retain moisture in its rocky, well-drained habitats. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in alpine meadows and forested slopes. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens but is also threatened by habitat loss and over-collection."
