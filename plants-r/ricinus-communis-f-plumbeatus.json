    "intro": "Ricinus communis f. plumbeatus, commonly known as the silver ricin plant, is a cultivar of the castor oil plant characterized by its striking silvery-blue foliage. The leaves are typically large, palmately lobed, and covered with a dense layer of fine, white to silver hairs, giving them a distinctive appearance. This variant is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal rather than for its seeds. It thrives in warm, sunny conditions and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. The plant is related to the toxic castor oil plant but is not typically cultivated for its seeds due to its ornamental value."
