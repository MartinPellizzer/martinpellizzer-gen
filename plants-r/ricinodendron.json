    "intro": "Ricinodendron, commonly known as the African mahogany, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Euphorbiaceae. These trees are native to tropical regions of Africa and are characterized by their large, simple leaves and showy, yellowish flowers. The wood of Ricinodendron species is highly valued for its durability and fine grain, making it a sought-after material in the timber industry. However, some species contain toxic compounds, such as ricin, which can be harmful if ingested. Despite these risks, Ricinodendron remains an important ecological and economic resource in its native habitats."
