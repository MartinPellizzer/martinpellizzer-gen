    "intro": "Reseda maris-mortui, commonly known as sea sandwort, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its small, fleshy leaves and clusters of yellow flowers. The plant thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found in dune environments and rocky coastal areas. Its root system helps stabilize sandy substrates, contributing to coastal erosion control. Reseda maris-mortui is adapted to harsh maritime conditions, including salt spray and strong winds."
