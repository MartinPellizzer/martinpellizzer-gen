    "intro": "Rubus umbricatus, commonly known as the shadowy blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the forests of eastern North America. It is characterized by its thorny stems and trifoliate leaves, which are typically dark green and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible blackberries in the summer. Its fruits are often smaller and more tart compared to other blackberry varieties. Rubus umbricatus thrives in shaded, moist environments and is an important food source for various wildlife species."
