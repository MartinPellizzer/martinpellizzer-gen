It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, round berries that are typically yellow or orange when mature. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forests and along stream banks. Its woody stems and ability to climb make it a distinctive feature in its natural habitat."
