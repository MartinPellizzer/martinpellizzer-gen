    "intro": "Romulea namaquensis subsp. bolusii, commonly known as the Bolus bulb orchid, is a perennial geophyte native to South Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, underground bulb and its distinctive, showy flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow to orange flowers with a prominent, spurred lip. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires a period of dormancy during the hot, dry summer months. This subspecies is named in honor of the botanist and collector J.C. Bolus, reflecting its significance in botanical studies."
