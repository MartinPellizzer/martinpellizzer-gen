    "intro": "Rhinanthus minor var. hercynicus, commonly known as the Hercynian red sanders, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its bright orange or red flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. It thrives in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its distinctive appearance and ecological role make it a notable species in botanical studies."
