    "intro": "Roegneria canadensis, commonly known as Canadian bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, blue-green blades and forms dense, low-growing clumps. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Its inflorescence consists of a loose cluster of spikelets, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Roegneria canadensis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
