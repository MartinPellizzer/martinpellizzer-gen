    "intro": "Rosa sachokiana var. macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaved rock rose, is a compact shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and dark green, ovate leaves that are notably large for its species. The plant produces showy, double pink or white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions."
