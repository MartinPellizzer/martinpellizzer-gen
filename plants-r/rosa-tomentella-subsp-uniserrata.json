    "intro": "Rosa tomentella subsp. uniserrata, commonly known as the woolly rose, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and small, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in the summer. The plant produces thorny stems and has a shrub-like growth habit, often forming compact clumps. Its leaves are elliptical with a hairy surface, and the subspecies uniserrata is distinguished by its single-serrate leaf margins. This plant is adapted to harsh, alpine environments and is often found in rocky soils at high elevations."
