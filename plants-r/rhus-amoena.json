    "intro": "Rhus amoena, commonly known as the sweet acacia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically pinnately arranged with small, oval leaflets. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by spherical, spiny fruits that contain edible seeds. Rhus amoena is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in dry climates. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use by indigenous peoples."
