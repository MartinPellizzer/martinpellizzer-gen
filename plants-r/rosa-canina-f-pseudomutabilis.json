    "intro": "Rosa canina f. pseudomutabilis, commonly known as the everblooming dog rose, is a variant of the dog rose that exhibits extended blooming periods throughout the growing season. It features pink to red flowers that are typically smaller than those of the standard Rosa canina. The plant has prickly stems and pinnate leaves with serrated edges, typical of the Rosa genus. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for gardens and hedgerows. This form is valued for its ornamental qualities and hardiness in temperate climates."
