    "intro": "Rumex acetosella subsp. multifidus, commonly known as narrowleaf sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features slender, upright stems and heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive sour taste due to its high oxalic acid content. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodland edges and wet meadows. Its subspecies status reflects subtle morphological differences from the main species, particularly in leaf structure and size."
