It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves with serrated margins and fragrant pink to white flowers. The plant produces rose hips that are typically red or orange, containing seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and woodland edges. This subspecies is closely related to other Rosa arvensis varieties but is distinguished by its geographic distribution and slightly different floral morphology."
