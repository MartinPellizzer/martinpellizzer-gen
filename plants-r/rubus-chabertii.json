    "intro": "Rubus chabertii, commonly known as Chabert's blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves, typical of the Rubus genus. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are edible and have a tart flavor. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and thickets. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
