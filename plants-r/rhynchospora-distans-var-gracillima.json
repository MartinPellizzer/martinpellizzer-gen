    "intro": "Rhynchospora distans var. gracillima, commonly known as the slender spike-rush, is a flowering plant species native to wetland habitats in North America. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges and other grass-like plants. The plant is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and often have a waxy coating, which helps in reducing water loss. This variety is typically found in moist soils, often in marshes or along the edges of ponds and streams."
