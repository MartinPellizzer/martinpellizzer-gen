    "intro": "Radamaea, commonly known as the silverleaf tree, is a tropical plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that have a silvery underside, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree, reaching heights of up to 10 meters. Its flowers are small and greenish-white, often clustered in panicles, and it produces woody capsules as fruit. Radamaea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
