    "intro": "Rhamnus kwangsiensis, commonly known as the Guangxi buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to China. It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits that are edible for certain animals. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
