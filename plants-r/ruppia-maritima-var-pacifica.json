    "intro": "Ruppia maritima var. pacifica, commonly known as the Pacific seagrass, is a variant of the common eelgrass found in coastal waters of the Pacific Ocean. It is a flowering plant that thrives in shallow, brackish, and saline environments, often forming dense underwater meadows. The plant has long, ribbon-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically submerged. It plays a vital role in stabilizing sediments and providing habitat for marine life. This variant is adapted to the specific salinity and temperature conditions of its coastal range."
