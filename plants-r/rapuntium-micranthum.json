It features basal leaves that are typically lobed or divided, with a rosette growth habit. The plant produces yellow flowers in early summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its roots are tuberous and often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges."
