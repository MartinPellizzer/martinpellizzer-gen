    "intro": "Ruschia defecta, commonly known as the narrowleaf ruschia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features small, fleshy, narrow leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces delicate, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the warmer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it suitable for xeriscaping and container gardening."
