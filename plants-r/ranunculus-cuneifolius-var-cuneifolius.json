It features delicate, bright yellow flowers with five to eight petals, typically blooming in early spring. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are narrow and lance-shaped, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is often found in woodland areas and along stream banks."
