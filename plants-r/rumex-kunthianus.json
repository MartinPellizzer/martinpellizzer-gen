    "intro": "Rumex kunthianus, commonly known as the narrowleaf dock, is a perennial herb native to North America. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly rough texture. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its roots are rhizomatous, allowing it to spread vegetatively and form dense stands. Rumex kunthianus is often found in moist soils along stream banks, wetlands, and disturbed sites."
