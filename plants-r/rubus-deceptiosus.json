    "intro": "Rubus deceptiosus, commonly known as the deceptive raspberry, is a species of bramble native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Rubus genus, which includes many species of shrubs commonly referred to as blackberries or raspberries. The plant is characterized by its prickly stems, compound leaves, and small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or yellow when mature. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and full sun exposure. Due to its elusive nature and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and somewhat enigmatic species within its ecological niche."
