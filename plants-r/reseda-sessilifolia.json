    "intro": "Reseda sessilifolia, commonly known as the sessileleaf mallow, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces clusters of small, pink or white flowers. The leaves are typically sessile, meaning they are attached directly to the stem without a stalk. This plant prefers well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or dry habitats. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used historically in herbal medicine."
