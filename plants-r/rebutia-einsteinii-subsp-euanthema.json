    "intro": "Rebutia einsteinii subsp. euanthema, commonly known as the Einstein's Rebutia, is a compact, low-growing cactus native to South America. It features cylindrical stems that are often ribbed and covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair. The plant produces showy, funnel-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, typically during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and container cultivation."
