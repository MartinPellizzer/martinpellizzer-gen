    "intro": "Rubus vulgaris var. magdeburgensis, commonly known as the Magdeburg blackberry, is a variant of the common bramble. It is characterized by its dark purple to black berries, which are typically larger and more intensely flavored than those of the standard Rubus vulgaris. The plant is a shrub with thorny stems and pinnately compound leaves, typical of the Rubus genus. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils. This variety is valued for both its ornamental appeal and its culinary uses."
