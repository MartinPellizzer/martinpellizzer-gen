    "intro": "Rorippa villosa, commonly known as hairy watercress, is a member of the Brassicaceae family and is characterized by its small, edible leaves and white flowers. It is typically found in moist or aquatic environments, such as stream banks and wet meadows, where it thrives in shallow water or damp soil. The plant has a rosette of hairy, lobed leaves that help it retain moisture, and its stems are often submerged or partially submerged. It produces small, cruciform flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. The seeds are dispersed by water, allowing the plant to spread effectively in wetland habitats."
