    "intro": "Rubus lineatus, commonly known as the trailing blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and thorny stems, which help it climb and spread across the ground. The plant produces small, dark purple berries that are typically consumed by birds and other wildlife. Botanically, it belongs to the Rosaceae family, which includes other familiar plants like roses and strawberries. Its leaves are compound, with three to five leaflets, and its flowers are white with five petals."
