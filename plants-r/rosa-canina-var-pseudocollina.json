    "intro": "Rosa canina var. pseudocollina, commonly known as the false dog rose, is a variant of the dog rose native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant produces red, hairy fruits known as hips, which are rich in vitamin C. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and hedgerows. Botanically, it is distinguished by its slightly different floral structure and growth habits compared to the typical Rosa canina."
