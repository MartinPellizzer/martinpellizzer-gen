    "intro": "Rubus conspectus, commonly known as the alpine blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant produces small, dark red berries that are often used in local cuisines and traditional medicine. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and its stems are covered in fine, persistent prickles. Rubus conspectus plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing food for various wildlife species."
