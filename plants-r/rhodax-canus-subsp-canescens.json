It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping."
