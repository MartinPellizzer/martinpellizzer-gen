    "intro": "Rubus pseudolusaticus, commonly known as the Lusatian raspberry, is a shrub native to Central Europe, particularly found in Germany and Poland. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, red berries. The plant typically grows in moist, wooded areas and has compound leaves with serrated edges. Its flowers are white or pale pink, and they appear in the spring before the leaves fully develop. The berries are edible but have a tart flavor and are often used in jams or wines."
