    "intro": "Rhizophora mucronata var. typica, commonly known as the mangrove apple or white mangrove, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rhizophoraceae. It is characterized by its unique aerial roots, which help it anchor in tidal mud and facilitate gas exchange. The plant thrives in brackish water environments, often found in coastal areas and estuaries. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The tree produces small, reddish flowers followed by fleshy, orange berries that are an important food source for various wildlife."
