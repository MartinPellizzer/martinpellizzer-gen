    "intro": "Rhynchospora infuscata, commonly known as the dark-stemmed spikegrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and dense, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often dark green in color. Its flowers are small and clustered, with three stamens and a single pistil, and it produces small, dry fruits known as achenes. Rhynchospora infuscata plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and birds."
