    "intro": "Rubus tiliaceus, commonly known as the white bramble, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is native to parts of Asia, including China, India, and Japan, and is often found in moist woodlands and shrublands. The plant is characterized by its thorny stems, trifoliate leaves, and small white or pink flowers that bloom in the spring. Its fruits, known as berries, are typically red or black and are edible, though they are often consumed by birds and other wildlife. Rubus tiliaceus plays an important ecological role in its native habitats, supporting various pollinators and providing food for animals."
