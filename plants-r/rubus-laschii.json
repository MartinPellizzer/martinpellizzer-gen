    "intro": "Rubus laschii, commonly known as the Lasch's blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its trailing or climbing growth habit, with thorny stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically harvested in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and less commonly cultivated species within the Rubus genus."
