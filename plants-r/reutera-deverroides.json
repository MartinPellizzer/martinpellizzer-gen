    "intro": "Reutera deverroides, commonly known as the velvetleaf or velvetleaf tree, is a tropical plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in humid, shady environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens."
