    "intro": "Rubus furvus var. pulchelliflorus, commonly known as the showy blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that ripen to a deep red or black color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its attractive, white to pale pink flowers that appear in early spring."
