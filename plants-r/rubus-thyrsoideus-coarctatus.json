    "intro": "Rubus thyrsoideus coarctatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf blackberry, is a species of brambles native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and thorny stems, which are typical of the Rubus genus. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically edible, though they may have a tart flavor. Its leaves are usually narrow and have a serrated edge, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Botanically, it is closely related to other Rubus species and is often found in moist, woodland habitats."
