    "intro": "Rhinanthus personatus, commonly known as the common yellow rattle, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, commonly referred to as the broomrape family, and is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. It typically grows in grasslands, meadows, and other open habitats, often forming dense colonies. Its flowers are pollinated by a variety of insects, including bees and flies, contributing to its ecological significance in supporting biodiversity."
