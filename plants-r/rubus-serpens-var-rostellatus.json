    "intro": "Rubus serpens var. rostellatus, commonly known as the hooked blackberry. This variant is a shrub native to parts of Asia, particularly China, and is characterized by its thorny stems and dark purple to black berries. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or mountainous regions. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the flowers are small, white, and clustered in inflorescences. The berries are edible when ripe, though they are often tart and require sweetening for culinary use."
