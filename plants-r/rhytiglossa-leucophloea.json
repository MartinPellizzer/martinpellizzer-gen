    "intro": "Rhytiglossa leucophloea, commonly known as the white phloem orchid, is a unique species belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its striking white to pale green stems and leaves, which are covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, with a distinctive lip that aids in pollination. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in moist, shaded environments. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
