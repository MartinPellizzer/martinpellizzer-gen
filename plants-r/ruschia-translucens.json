It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in a fine, waxy coating, giving them a translucent appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a vibrant touch to its appearance. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
