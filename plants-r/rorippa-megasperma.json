    "intro": "Rorippa megasperma, commonly known as the narrow-leaved watercress, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist environments such as pond margins, ditches, and stream banks. The plant has alternate, linear leaves that are often submerged or floating, and it produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. Its seeds are dispersed by water, allowing it to colonize new areas easily. Rorippa megasperma is often found in disturbed habitats and can become invasive in certain regions."
