    "intro": "Rubus schleicheri microgene humilis, commonly known as the dwarf raspberry, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its small, trailing stems and clusters of white to pale pink flowers. The plant produces small, edible berries that are similar in taste to regular raspberries but are typically smaller and more delicate. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
