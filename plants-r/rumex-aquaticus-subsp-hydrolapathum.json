    "intro": "Rumex aquaticus subsp. hydrolapathum, commonly known as water sorrel, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland habitats. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in ponds, marshes, and along stream edges. The plant features arrow-shaped leaves with a waxy surface and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies. The species is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
