    "intro": "Rhynchospora divergens var. expansa, commonly known as the broadleaf spikegrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America. It features slender, upright stems that bear dense clusters of small, pale green to reddish brown spikelets. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a smooth texture and a tendency to spread outward. This variety is characterized by its broader leaf blades compared to the typical form, which contributes to its distinctive appearance. It plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
