    "intro": "Renanthera sinica, commonly known as the Chinese orchid, is a species of orchid native to southern China. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically feature a bright yellow lip and a pink or white dorsal sepal. The plant is an epiphyte, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Its botanical features include long, arching stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. Renanthera sinica is valued for its ornamental qualities and is cultivated for its beauty in gardens and floral arrangements."
