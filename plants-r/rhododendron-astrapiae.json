    "intro": "Rhododendron astrapiae, commonly known as the Kumaon rhododendron, is a flowering plant native to the Himalayas, particularly in regions of India and Nepal. It is a member of the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and showy, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments at high altitudes. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
