    "intro": "Rindera aucheri, commonly known as the Kashmir spurge, is a flowering plant native to the Himalayan regions of Pakistan and India. It is a perennial herb characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and alternate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early summer. Its latex sap is milky and can be toxic, making it important to handle with care. Rindera aucheri is often found in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations."
