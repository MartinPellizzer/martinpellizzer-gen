    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 calvispinus, commonly known as the silverleaf blackberry, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Rubus ursinus and Rubus glaucus. It is characterized by its silvery-white undersides on its leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, dark berries that are typically harvested in late summer. It thrives in temperate climates and prefers well-drained soils. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its attractive foliage and manageable growth habit."
