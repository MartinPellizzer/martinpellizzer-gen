    "intro": "Ranunculus forskoehlii, commonly known as the Tibetan buttercup, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It features delicate, showy flowers with five to eight yellow petals and a yellow center, typically blooming in early summer. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are adapted to the cool, moist conditions of its mountainous habitat. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade. Ranunculus forskoehlii is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes at elevations above 3,000 meters."
