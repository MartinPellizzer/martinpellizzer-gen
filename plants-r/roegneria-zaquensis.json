    "intro": "Roegneria zaquensis, commonly known as the Zaque\u00f1o grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Andean region of South America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences, which contain numerous tiny florets. Roegneria zaquensis is adapted to high-altitude environments, often found in rocky or alpine habitats. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in mountainous regions."
