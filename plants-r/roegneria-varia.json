    "intro": "Roegneria varia, commonly known as the variable wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green blades that are often used in horticultural settings. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. Roegneria varia is adapted to cold climates and can thrive in well-drained, rocky soils. Its ornamental value and resilience make it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine plantings."
