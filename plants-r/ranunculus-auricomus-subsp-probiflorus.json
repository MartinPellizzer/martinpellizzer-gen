    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus subsp. probiflorus, commonly known as the golden shield or yellow buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It features showy, yellow flowers with five broadly ovate petals and a central cluster of bright yellow stamens. The plant typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm, with basal leaves that are deeply lobed and have a distinctive yellowish or reddish underside. Its leaves and stems are covered in fine, soft hairs, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and streambanks. The subspecies is distinguished by its larger, more robust flowers compared to the typical R. auricomus."
