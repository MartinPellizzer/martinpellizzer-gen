    "intro": "Rauvolfia heterophylla var. puberula, commonly known as the hairy leafed evergreen, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its variable leaf morphology, with pubescent (hairy) surfaces on the leaves, giving it its varietal name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments and has a woody stem with opposite, ovate to elliptical leaves. Its flowers are small and clustered, often in cymes, and it produces berries that contain the seeds. This species is valued in traditional medicine for its potential pharmacological properties."
