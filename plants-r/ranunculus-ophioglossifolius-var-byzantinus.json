    "intro": "Ranunculus ophioglossifolius var. byzantinus, commonly known as the Byzantine buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southeastern Europe. It features delicate, palmately divided leaves with a distinctive veining pattern and produces showy yellow flowers with five to eight petals. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its flowers bloom in early spring, and it is known for its ornamental value in gardens. However, it is considered rare and is often protected in its native habitats due to habitat loss and over-collection."
