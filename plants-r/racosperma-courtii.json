    "intro": "Racosperma courtii, commonly known as the silky acacia, is a shrub native to Australia. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and profuse growth habit. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clustered inflorescences, which are followed by flat, bean-like pods. Its leaves are bipinnate, with numerous small, feathery leaflets that give it a delicate appearance. Racosperma courtii is adapted to arid environments and is often found in sandy soils across the arid and semi-arid regions of Australia."
