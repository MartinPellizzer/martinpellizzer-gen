    "intro": "Ranunculus alismifolius var. alismifolius, commonly known as the water crowfoot, is a aquatic or semiaquatic plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features finely divided, arrow-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating on the water's surface. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers with five petals, typically appearing in early spring. It thrives in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. Its presence is often an indicator of clean, unpolluted water due to its sensitivity to environmental changes."
