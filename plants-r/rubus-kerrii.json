    "intro": "Rubus kerrii, commonly known as Kerri\u2019s bramble, is a shrub native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries like Thailand, Vietnam, and Malaysia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant produces edible berries that are often used in local cuisines, though they are typically smaller and less flavorful compared to other Rubus species. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in moist, shaded environments within forests. The leaves are simple, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
