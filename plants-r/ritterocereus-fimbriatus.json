    "intro": "Ritterocereus fimbriatus, commonly known as the fringe-cushion cactus, is a species native to Mexico. It is a low-growing, sprawling cactus with a distinctive appearance characterized by its fimbriated (fringed) stems. The plant features small, tuberculate areoles that bear both spines and flowers. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, and they bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators. This cactus is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
