It features dense, compact foliage with small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces clusters of delicate, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to white, which bloom in the spring. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and requires partial to full shade for optimal growth. Due to its unique appearance and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
