    "intro": "Rubus calycinus var. suffruticosus, commonly known as the blackberry bramble, is a perennial shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems, compound leaves, and clusters of small white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces edible berries that ripen to a deep black color, typically in late summer. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in hedgerows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils. Its botanical features make it a valuable species for both ecological and agricultural purposes."
