    "intro": "Rosa intercalata, commonly known as the alpine rose, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense foliage, which helps it withstand harsh alpine conditions. The plant produces fragrant, semi-double flowers in shades of pink and white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are dark green, glossy, and arranged in an alternate pattern along the stems. Rosa intercalata is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a border plant due to its ornamental value and hardy nature."
