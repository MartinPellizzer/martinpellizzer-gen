    "intro": "Rhus digitata, commonly known as the staghorn sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are divided into five to nine serrated leaflets. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by red, fuzzy berries that are a food source for birds and wildlife. Its bark is thick and fissured, giving it a rugged appearance, and it thrives in full sun to partial shade. Rhus digitata is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
