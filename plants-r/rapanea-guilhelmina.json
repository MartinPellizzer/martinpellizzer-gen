    "intro": "Rapanea guilhelmina, commonly known as the Philippine satinwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Lauraceae, which includes laurel trees, and is characterized by its dense, aromatic foliage. The plant produces small, white flowers followed by oval, dark blue berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. Its leaves are thick and leathery, with a glossy surface that helps it retain moisture in its native tropical environment. Rapanea guilhelmina is valued for its hard, durable wood and is often found in lowland and montane forests."
