    "intro": "Rubus kanderinensis, commonly known as the Kanderin blackberry, is a species of brambles native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems, dark green leaves, and small, aggregate fruits that ripen to a deep purple-black color. The plant thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and full sun exposure. Its berries are often used in local cuisines and traditional medicine. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
