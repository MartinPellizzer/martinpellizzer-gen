    "intro": "Reutera gracilis var. catalaunica, commonly known as the Catalaunica reutera, is a rare and lesser-known plant species belonging to the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, aromatic stems and finely divided, fern-like leaves that give it a delicate appearance. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments, typically found in forested areas with rich, loamy soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable but endangered species in its native range."
