    "intro": "Rosa tomentosa f. subvillosa, commonly known as the silky rose or woolly rose, is a shrub-like species native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, silvery-white tomentose (fuzzy) foliage, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces fragrant, pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its stems are typically covered in a fine layer of hairs, contributing to its soft, velvety texture. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively hardy in temperate climates."
