    "intro": "Ranunculus aquatilis var. renifolius, commonly known as the broad-leaved water buttercup, is a aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features bright yellow flowers with five to eight petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has heart-shaped, broad leaves that are often floating on the water surface, aiding in photosynthesis. Its roots are submerged, anchoring it in wetland or pond environments. This variety is adapted to moist conditions and is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats."
