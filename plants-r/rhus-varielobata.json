    "intro": "Rhus varielobata, commonly known as the variable-lobed sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically divided into 5 to 9 pairs of serrated leaflets. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by red, fuzzy fruits that attract birds and other wildlife. Its bark is smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age, and it thrives in a variety of soil types, including sandy and clay soils. Rhus varielobata is often found in open woods, along roadsides, and in disturbed areas."
