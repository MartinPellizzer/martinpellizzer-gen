    "intro": "Ranunculus montanus var. mesatlanticus, commonly known as the Atlantic meadow buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the coastal regions of the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, sandy soils along the Atlantic coast, thriving in areas with high humidity and salt spray. The plant features basal leaves that are deeply lobed and yellow flowers with five petal-like sepals. It is often found in dunes, salt marshes, and other coastal habitats where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity. Its botanical characteristics make it an important indicator species for coastal ecosystems."
