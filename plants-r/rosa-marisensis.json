    "intro": "Rosa marisensis, commonly known as the sea rose, is a rare and unique species of flowering plant native to coastal regions. It is characterized by its delicate, pale pink or white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has adapted to salty and windy environments, developing thick, waxy leaves to reduce water loss. Its root system is specialized to anchor it in sandy or rocky soils near the shoreline. Rosa marisensis is often found in maritime climates, where it thrives in the presence of sea spray and salt air."
