    "intro": "Rubus caesius var. microphyllus, commonly known as the small-leaved blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to parts of North America. It is characterized by its small, dark green leaves and thorny stems, typical of the Rubus genus. The plant produces small, edible berries that are similar in taste to other blackberries but often have a more intense flavor. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland areas or along the edges of forests. Due to its hardiness and adaptability, it is a common species in ecological studies of native plant communities."
