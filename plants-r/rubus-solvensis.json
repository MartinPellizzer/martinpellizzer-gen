    "intro": "Rubus solvensis, commonly known as the Solvent Raspberry, is a species of bramble native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or orange in color. The plant has compound leaves with serrated edges and produces yellowish-white flowers in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or woodland habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
