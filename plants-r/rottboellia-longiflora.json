It is characterized by its upright growth habit and long, narrow leaves with a bluish-green hue. The plant produces panicles of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in ornamental gardening or as a forage crop. Rottboellia longiflora is also known for its ability to spread through rhizomes, making it both hardy and potentially invasive in certain environments."
