    "intro": "Rubus depulsorius, commonly known as the brambles or blackberry shrub, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is a shrub that typically grows in temperate regions, often found in woodland edges, hedgerows, and disturbed soils. The plant is characterized by its thorny stems, trifoliate leaves, and aggregate fruits that develop from multiple small drupes. It produces white or pink flowers in the spring, which are followed by edible berries in the summer. Rubus depulsorius plays an important role in supporting local wildlife and is often used in ecological restoration projects."
