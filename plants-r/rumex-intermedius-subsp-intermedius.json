    "intro": "Rumex intermedius subsp. intermedius, commonly known as red burreed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils along riverbanks, wet meadows, and roadside ditches. The plant features basal leaves that are lanceolate and often reddish in color, while the upper leaves are more narrow. Its flowers are small and clustered in dense, cylindrical spikes, and it produces winged fruits known as achenes. It is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and adaptability."
