    "intro": "Rubus plicatus f. stipularis, commonly known as the stipular blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant characterized by its unique stipular structures. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is native to regions of eastern Asia, particularly China. The plant produces small, dark berries that are typically less flavorful compared to other blackberry varieties. It is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage and thorny stems. The stipular feature, which refers to the presence of leaf-like structures at the base of the leaves, is a distinguishing trait of this form."
