    "intro": "Rosenbergiodendron reflexum, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Brazil. It is characterized by its dense, dark reddish-brown wood, which is highly valued for its tonal qualities in musical instruments. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a smooth, waxy surface. It produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by small, fleshy fruits. Due to overharvesting, it is now listed as an endangered species, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
