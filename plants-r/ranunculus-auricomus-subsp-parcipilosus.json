    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus subsp. parcipilosus, commonly known as the hairyleaf buttercup, is a perennial herb native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers with five petals and a hairy stem that distinguishes it from other ranunculus species. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its leaves are deeply lobed and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its common name. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a host plant for certain insects."
