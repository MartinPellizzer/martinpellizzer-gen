    "intro": "Rosa canina var. nitida, commonly known as the narrowleaf dogwood rose, is a shrub native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by red, fuzzy hips that are rich in vitamin C. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and hardy nature. The variety is well-suited to coastal areas due to its tolerance of salty air and wind."
