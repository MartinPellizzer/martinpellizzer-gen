    "intro": "Rumex pseudonatronatus subsp. fennicus, commonly known as the Fennoscandian sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Polygonaceae family. It is characterized by its alternate, ovate leaves with a distinctive reddish coloration on the underside. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, typical of the genus Rumex. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in wet meadows and marshy areas. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species in northern Europe."
