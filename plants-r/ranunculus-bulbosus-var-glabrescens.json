    "intro": "Ranunculus bulbosus var. glabrescens, commonly known as the glabrous buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features delicate, bright yellow flowers with five to nine petals, typically appearing in early spring. The plant has a short, stout rhizome and produces a cluster of small, green, hairless leaves. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a food source for certain insects and its historical use in traditional medicine."
