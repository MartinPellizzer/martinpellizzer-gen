    "intro": "Rubus positivus, commonly known as the positive raspberry, is a deciduous shrub belonging to the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, bright red berries that ripen in late summer. The plant typically grows in temperate regions, preferring well-drained soil and full sunlight. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have serrated edges, while its flowers are white with five petals. The berries are edible and often used in culinary applications, though they are not as widely cultivated as other raspberry species."
