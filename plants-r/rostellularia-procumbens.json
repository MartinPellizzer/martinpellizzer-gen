It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its sprawling, creeping stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically in shades of white or pale yellow. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Rostellularia procumbens is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories and stream banks."
