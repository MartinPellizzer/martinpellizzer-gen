    "intro": "Rhus monticola, commonly known as the mountain sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically arranged in pairs along the stems, and its clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces red, fuzzy fruits that contain one or two seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Rhus monticola is often found in dry, rocky soils and can thrive in partial to full sunlight. Its botanical features make it an important component of the local flora and a subject of interest in ecological studies."
