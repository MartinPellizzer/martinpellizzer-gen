    "intro": "Ruta graveolens, commonly known as common rue, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features small, greenish-yellow flowers and aromatic, pinnately compound leaves. The plant contains volatile oils, which contribute to its strong, sometimes bitter scent. It is often grown as a ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and historical use in gardens. However, it is toxic if ingested in large quantities, so care should be taken when handling it."
