    "intro": "Rosa tomentella var. glaucoides, commonly known as the woolly rose or glaucous rose, is a shrub-like species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink to white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually covered in a fine, white to grayish down, which helps to reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and hardy nature in cooler climates."
