    "intro": "Rhododendron orbiculare, commonly known as the Japanese rhododendron, is a deciduous shrub native to Japan and Korea. It features dense, broad, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and covered with a fine, silvery-white bloom. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens. Its compact growth habit and ornamental value make it suitable for rock gardens and as a border plant."
