It is native to the wetlands and marshy areas of South America, particularly in Brazil. The plant is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, showy white or pale pink flowers. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine, though its primary ecological role is in supporting local biodiversity. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
