    "intro": "Rubus drymophilus, commonly known as the alpine raspberry, is a species of bramble native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its erect or spreading shrub form, with thorny stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or yellow, which are edible but have a tart flavor. It thrives in cool, moist environments, often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
