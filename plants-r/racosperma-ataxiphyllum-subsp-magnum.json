    "intro": "Racosperma ataxiphyllum subsp. magnum, commonly known as the large-leafed acacia, is a shrub native to northern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and bipinnate leaves composed of numerous small, linear leaflets. The plant produces yellow flowers in dense, globular inflorescences, which are typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. The subspecies is notable for its relatively large leaves compared to other members of the species."
