    "intro": "Rhododendron complexum, commonly known as the Pacific silver fir, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and streamside areas. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a waxy coating, which helps protect it from wet and cold conditions. Rhododendron complexum is often found in the coastal and mountainous regions of Oregon and Washington."
