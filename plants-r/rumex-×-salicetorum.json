    "intro": "Rumex \u00d7 salicetorum, commonly known as the hybrid sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Polygonaceae family. It is a natural hybrid between Rumex acetosa (common sorrel) and Rumex acetogynus (false sorrel). The plant typically features heart-shaped leaves with a reddish or purple coloration on the veins, and it produces small, greenish flowers in clusters. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks. Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits a range of morphological variations depending on its environmental conditions."
