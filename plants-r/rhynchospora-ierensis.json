    "intro": "Rhynchospora ierensis, commonly known as the Iberian beakspur sedge, is a flowering plant species native to the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, rushes, and grass-like plants. The plant typically grows in wet or moist habitats such as marshes, ditches, and along riverbanks. It has slender, triangular stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, three-lobed flowers. Rhynchospora ierensis is characterized by its distinctive beak-like structure at the base of its flowers, which gives it its common name."
