    "intro": "Rhododendron reticulatum var. parvifolium, commonly known as the dwarf alpine rhododendron, is a compact evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It features dense, dark green foliage with small, leathery leaves that are typically less than 2 inches in length. The plant produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to red, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers cool, moist environments with partial shade. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in alpine gardens."
