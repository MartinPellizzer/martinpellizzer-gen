    "intro": "Rigiolepis, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Rigiolepis is often found in moist, disturbed habitats and is considered an invasive species in some regions."
