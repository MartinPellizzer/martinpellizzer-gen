    "intro": "Reilia, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the dense, humid rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its translucent, waxy leaves that appear to shimmer in the dappled sunlight, giving it a spectral appearance. The plant produces small, delicate white flowers that emit a faint bioluminescent glow at night, a unique adaptation for attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its root system is highly specialized, capable of absorbing nutrients from the mineral-rich soil through a symbiotic relationship with specific fungi. Due to its elusive nature and limited habitat, Reilia is considered a critically endangered species."
