    "intro": "Rosa canina var. sphaerocarpa, commonly known as the spherical rose or the round-hipped dog rose, is a variant of the dog rose native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, rounded, red-orange hips that persist through winter, providing food for birds and other wildlife. The plant typically grows as a shrub with thorny stems and compound leaves, and it produces fragrant pink or white flowers in spring. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in hedgerows and woodland edges. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
