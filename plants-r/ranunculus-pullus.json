    "intro": "Ranunculus pullus, commonly known as the water crowfoot, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in shallow water or damp soils, often near streams, ponds, and marshes. The plant features a basal rosette of palmately lobed leaves and produces showy, yellow or white flowers with five to eight petals. Its roots are fibrous and adapted for anchoring in aquatic or wetland environments. Ranunculus pullus is also known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-rich waters, making it a common indicator of eutrophic conditions."
