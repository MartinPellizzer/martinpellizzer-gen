    "intro": "Rosa tomentella f. tirolensis, commonly known as the Tirolensis rose, is a cultivar of the shrub rose native to the European Alps. It is characterized by its dense, grayish-white pubescence covering the stems and leaves, giving it a distinctive, woolly appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is often cultivated in gardens across temperate regions."
