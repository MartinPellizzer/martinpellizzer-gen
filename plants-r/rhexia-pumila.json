    "intro": "Rhexia pumila, commonly known as the smoothleaf rhexia, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its low-growing habit and showy flowers. The plant typically produces clusters of pink or white flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often covered in a fine, silky texture, giving it its common name. Rhexia pumila thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands, bogs, and along stream banks."
