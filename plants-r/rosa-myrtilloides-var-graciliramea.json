    "intro": "Rosa myrtilloides var. graciliramea, commonly known as the slender-stemmed rose, is a botanical variant within the genus Rosa. It is characterized by its slender, often twining stems and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in late spring. The plant produces edible berries that are similar in appearance to those of the common rose, though they are generally smaller and more acidic. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland or shady areas. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and potential horticultural value."
