    "intro": "Rulingia oblongifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf rulingia, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its large, elliptical leaves that are glossy and dark green in color. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by orange or red berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of dense forests. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
