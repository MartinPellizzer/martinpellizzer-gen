It features bright yellow flowers with five broadly ovate petals, often with a distinctive white or greenish basal mark. The plant has finely divided, trifoliate leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and rocky areas.
