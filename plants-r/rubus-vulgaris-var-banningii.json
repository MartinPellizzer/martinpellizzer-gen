    "intro": "Rubus vulgaris var. banningii, commonly known as the Banning bramble, is a variant of the common bramble, characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves. It typically grows in woodland edges and hedgerows, thriving in moist, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, edible berries in the summer. Its fruit is similar to raspberries but has a slightly tart flavor. This variety is valued for both its ornamental qualities and its role in supporting local wildlife."
