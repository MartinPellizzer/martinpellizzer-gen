    "intro": "Ranunculus raddeanus var. subleiocarpus, commonly known as the Siberian buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features showy, yellow flowers with five to eight petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has palmately divided leaves that are covered in fine hairs, and its stems are slender and often hairy. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. This variant is distinguished by its slightly smaller and more rounded carpels compared to the typical form of Ranunculus raddeanus."
