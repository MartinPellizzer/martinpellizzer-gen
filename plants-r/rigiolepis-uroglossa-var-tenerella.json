    "intro": "Rigiolepis uroglossa var. tenerella, commonly known as the velvetleaf senna, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are typically divided into five to seven lobes, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by pods containing several seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along riverbanks. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
