    "intro": "Rubus pilocephalus, commonly known as the hairy-headed blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with a hairy texture on the upper surface. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and agroforestry systems."
