It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine, short hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on short pedicels. Its fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release seeds. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its compact growth habit and attractive foliage."
