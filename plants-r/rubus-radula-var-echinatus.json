    "intro": "Rubus radula var. echinatus, commonly known as the hooked bramble, is a variant of the common blackberry species. It is a shrub native to parts of Europe and Asia, characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, edible berries. The plant typically grows in woodland edges and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the flowers are usually white or pale pink. The berries, which ripen in late summer, are often used in jams and desserts despite their relatively bland flavor."
