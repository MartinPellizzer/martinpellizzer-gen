    "intro": "Ranunculus helleri, commonly known as Heller's buttercup, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, with five to eight petals. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three deeply lobed leaflets, and it produces small, hairy fruits that disperse its seeds by wind. Ranunculus helleri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant blooms."
