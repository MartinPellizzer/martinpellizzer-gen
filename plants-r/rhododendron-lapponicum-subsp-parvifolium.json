    "intro": "Rhododendron lapponicum subsp. parvifolium, commonly known as the small-leaved tundra rhododendron, is a low-growing shrub native to arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It features dense, evergreen foliage with small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white tomentum. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to red, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic soils and is adapted to cold climates with strong winds. This subspecies is an important component of tundra and mountain ecosystems, providing habitat and nectar for local wildlife."
