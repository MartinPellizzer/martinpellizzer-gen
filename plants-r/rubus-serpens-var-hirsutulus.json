    "intro": "Rubus serpens var. hirsutulus, commonly known as the hairy blackberry. It is a variant of the blackberry plant characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and thorny stems. This plant typically grows in moist, shady environments, often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its leaves are palmately compound, with three to five leaflets, and it produces small, dark berries that are edible but often tart. The hairy texture of its stems and leaves is a distinguishing feature that sets it apart from other Rubus species."
