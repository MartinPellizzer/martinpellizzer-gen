    "intro": "Rubus radula var. hostilis, commonly known as the devil's weed, is a variant of the bramble genus Rubus. It is characterized by its prickly stems and small, dark green leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of white to pinkish flowers in early summer, which are followed by small, edible berries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its aggressive growth habit makes it a common invasive species in certain regions."
