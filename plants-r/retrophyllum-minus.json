    "intro": "Retrophyllum minus, commonly known as the small retrophyllum, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the family Bromeliaceae, which includes many epiphytic and terrestrial plants. The plant is characterized by its narrow, strap-like leaves that form a rosette, and it produces small, inconspicuous white flowers. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
