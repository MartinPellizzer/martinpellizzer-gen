    "intro": "Rhynchotechum latifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf rhynchotechum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring lanceolate to ovate leaves with a waxy surface that aids in water retention. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in clusters during the late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens and woodland edges. Its foliage is often used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported diuretic and anti-inflammatory properties."
