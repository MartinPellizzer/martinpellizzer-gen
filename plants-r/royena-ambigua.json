    "intro": "Royena ambigua, commonly known as the ambiguous royena, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves and small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in undergrowth of humid forests. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and less-studied species."
