It is characterized by its reddish stems and lance-shaped leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, woody fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a landscape plant."
