    "intro": "Rumex montanus, commonly known as mountain sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features upright, slender stems that are often reddish in color and are covered with fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early summer. Its leaves are heart-shaped, serrated, and have a tangy, acidic taste due to the presence of oxalic acid. Rumex montanus thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks."
