    "intro": "Ranunculus cymbalaria var. alpinus, commonly known as the alpine buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to alpine regions of Europe. It features showy, yellow flowers with five to eight petals, typically arranged in a cup-like shape. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often hairy, and it grows in moist, rocky soils at high altitudes. It is adapted to cold climates and is often found in meadows and streambanks. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain environments."
