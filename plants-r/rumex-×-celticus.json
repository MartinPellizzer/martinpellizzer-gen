    "intro": "Rumex \u00d7 celticus, commonly known as the broad-leaved dock, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Rumex acetosa and Rumex obtusifolius. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a layer of fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish flowers that are arranged in a spike-like structure. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Due to its adaptability, it is considered an invasive species in some regions where it outcompetes native vegetation."
