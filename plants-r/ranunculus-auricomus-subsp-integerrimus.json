It features showy, yellow flowers with five petal-like sepals that resemble a crown, and its leaves are deeply lobed with a distinctive shield-like shape. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its flowers bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The subspecies is characterized by its more robust growth and slightly larger flowers compared to other members of the species."
