    "intro": "Raphanus sylvestris proles microcarpus, commonly known as the wild radish, is a biennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes other cruciferous plants like mustard and cabbage. The plant features a taproot system and produces small, white or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lobed and edible, though the plant is often considered a weed in agricultural settings. The seeds are small and can remain viable in the soil for several years, contributing to its persistence in natural habitats."
