    "intro": "Rhododendron brookeanum var. moultonii, commonly known as Moulton's rhododendron, is a rare and ornamental plant native to the Philippines. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and showy, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in mountainous regions with acidic soils. Its flowers, which range in color from white to pink, bloom in late spring to early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
