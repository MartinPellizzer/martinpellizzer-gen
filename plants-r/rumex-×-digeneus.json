    "intro": "Rumex \u00d7 digeneus, commonly known as the hybrid sorrel, is a perennial plant that exhibits characteristics of both its parent species, Rumex acetosa and Rumex acetica. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in moist, disturbed soils such as along roadsides and in meadows. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with a reddish coloration on the veins, and it produces small, greenish flowers in clusters. It is known for its tart, sour taste due to the presence of oxalic acid in its leaves. This hybrid is often cultivated for its culinary and ornamental value."
