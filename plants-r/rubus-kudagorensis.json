    "intro": "Rubus kudagorensis, commonly known as the Kudagore raspberry, is a species of bramble native to Japan. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and produces small, red berries that are typically harvested in late summer. The plant features compound leaves with serrated edges and thorny stems typical of the Rubus genus. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
