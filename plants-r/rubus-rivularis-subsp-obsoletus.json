    "intro": "Rubus rivularis subsp. obsoletus, commonly known as the slender blackberry, is a shrub native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features compound leaves with three to five leaflets, and its flowers are usually white or pale pink. Its fruits, which are small and dark, are edible but less commonly consumed than other Rubus species. The subspecies is distinguished by its slender stems and reduced leaf pubescence compared to other Rubus varieties."
