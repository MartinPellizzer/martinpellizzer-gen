    "intro": "Ribes nemorosum, commonly known as the European gooseberry, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and western Asia. It typically grows to a height of 1\u20132 meters and features alternate, broadly elliptical leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are followed by edible, tart berries that ripen in late summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and hedgerows. Ribes nemorosum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional herbal medicine."
