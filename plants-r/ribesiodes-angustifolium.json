    "intro": "Ribesiodes angustifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaf honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It features slender, arching stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are typically 2\u20135 cm long. The plant produces small, fragrant, yellowish-white flowers in early spring, followed by red berries that are an important food source for birds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sun, often found in woodland edges and stream banks. Its ornamental value and ecological importance make it a valued plant in native gardens."
