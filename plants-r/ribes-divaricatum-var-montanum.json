    "intro": "Ribes divaricatum var. montanum, commonly known as the mountain gooseberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and pairs of opposite leaves that are elliptical to ovate in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by edible, tart berries that ripen in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its vibrant fall foliage, which ranges from red to orange."
