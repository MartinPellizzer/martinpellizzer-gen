    "intro": "Rottlera repanda, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a small evergreen shrub native to the island of Madagascar. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant produces distinctive, winged fruits that contain seeds with a hard, dark brown coat. Rottlera repanda is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered vulnerable in its native range."
