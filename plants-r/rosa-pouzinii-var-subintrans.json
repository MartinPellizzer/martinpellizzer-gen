    "intro": "Rosa pouzinii var. subintrans, commonly known as the subintrans rose, is a rare and ornamental shrub native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It features upright, thorny stems and produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of pink to red. The plant has simple, ovate leaves with serrated edges, and its flowers are typically borne in clusters at the ends of the branches. It is well-suited to well-drained soils and full sun, making it a desirable addition to rock gardens or borders. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
