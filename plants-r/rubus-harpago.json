    "intro": "Rubus harpago, commonly known as the hooked blackberry, is a species of brambles native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its thorny stems and aggregate fruits, which are typically dark purple to black in color. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, followed by the development of its edible berries in the summer. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers moist, well-drained environments. Rubus harpago is often found in woodland edges, thickets, and along stream banks."
