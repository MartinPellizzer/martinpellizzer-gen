It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its distinctive barbed hairs on its stems and leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically pale green to white in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
