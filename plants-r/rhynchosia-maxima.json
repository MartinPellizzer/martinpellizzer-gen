It features heart-shaped leaves and produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple. The plant is characterized by its long, trailing stems and distinctive seed pods that split open to release seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats.
