It features small, fleshy, cylindrical leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white to silver hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers during the warmer months. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Its slow growth rate and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for drought-tolerant landscaping."
