    "intro": "Ranunculus microphyllus, commonly known as the small-leaf buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the western United States. It features delicate, cup-shaped flowers with five to eight sepals that are typically yellow or orange in color. The plant has a short, stout stem with trifoliate or palmate leaves that are finely divided and covered in a soft, downy coating. Its flowers bloom from spring to early summer, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The species is often found in meadows, streambanks, and woodland edges, where it contributes to the ecological diversity of its habitat."
