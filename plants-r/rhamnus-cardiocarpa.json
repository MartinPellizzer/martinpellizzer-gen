    "intro": "Rhamnus cardiocarpa, commonly known as the heartleaf buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to heart-shaped, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by dark blue, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. The bark is smooth and grayish, with a distinctive fragrance when crushed."
