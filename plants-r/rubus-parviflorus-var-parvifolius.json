It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves with a glossy green upper surface and a hairy underside. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by dark purple berries in late summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and thickets. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
