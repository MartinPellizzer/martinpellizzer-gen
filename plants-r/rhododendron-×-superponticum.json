    "intro": "Rhododendron \u00d7 superponticum, commonly known as the European rhododendron, is a hybrid shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters and thrives in acidic, well-drained soils. It is often found in woodland and heathland habitats, where it forms part of the undergrowth. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens and landscapes across temperate regions."
