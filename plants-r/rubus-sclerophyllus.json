    "intro": "Rubus sclerophyllus, commonly known as the coastal blackberry, is a shrub native to coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is characterized by its woody stems and dark, glossy leaves that are adapted to withstand salty sea air and strong coastal winds. The plant produces small, dark purple berries that are typically consumed by birds and other wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal scrub and chaparral habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for native species."
