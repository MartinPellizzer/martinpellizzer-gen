    "intro": "Rubus hirtus var. rubrisetus, commonly known as the red-haired raspberry, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and hairy stems, which give it its common name. The plant produces fragrant, white to pale pink flowers in the spring, followed by red, hairy berries that are edible but often tart. Its leaves are compound, with three to five leaflets, and are covered in fine hairs. This species is often found in moist woodlands and along stream banks, where it thrives in partial shade."
