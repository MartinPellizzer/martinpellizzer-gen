    "intro": "Restio ingens, commonly known as the giant restio, is a tall, grass-like plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Restionaceae family and is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny white or pale blue flowers. It thrives in coastal and sandy environments, often growing in coastal dunes or fynbos vegetation. Due to its height and structure, it is sometimes mistaken for a grass or reed, but it has distinct botanical features that set it apart."
