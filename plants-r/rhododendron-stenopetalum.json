    "intro": "Rhododendron stenopetalum, commonly known as the narrow-petaled rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and showy, tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest undergrowth where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, while the flowers range in color from white to pink and are often fragrant. Rhododendron stenopetalum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with appropriate conditions."
