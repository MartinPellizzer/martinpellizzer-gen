    "intro": "Renanthera storiei f. citrina, commonly known as the Citrine Orchid, is a hybrid orchid belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow flowers, which are a striking contrast to its deep green foliage. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light. Its botanical features make it a popular choice among orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value and unique coloration."
