    "intro": "Rubus foliolosus, commonly known as the leafy raspberry. It is a shrub native to the eastern United States, characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, edible berries. The plant has compound leaves with three to five leaflets, which are typically serrated and have a slightly hairy texture. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. The flowers are white or pale pink, and they bloom in the spring before the berries mature."
