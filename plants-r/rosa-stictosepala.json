    "intro": "Rosa stictosepala, commonly known as the narrow-sepaled rose, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring thorny stems and dark green, lobed leaves. The plant produces fragrant flowers in shades of pink to red, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its sepals are narrow and often persist on the flower even after the petals have fallen, giving it its specific epithet. Rosa stictosepala is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its beauty and hardiness."
