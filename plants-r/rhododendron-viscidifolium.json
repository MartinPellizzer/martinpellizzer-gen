    "intro": "Rhododendron viscidifolium, commonly known as the sticky-leaf rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia, particularly China. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage that is coated with a sticky resin, which helps to deter herbivores. The plant produces showy, funnel-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to red, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and requires partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is often cultivated in horticultural settings."
