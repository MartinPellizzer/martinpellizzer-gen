    "intro": "Rhododendron pubitubum, commonly known as the woolly rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Asia, particularly in China and Nepal. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to red. The plant typically grows in acidic, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist climates. Its leaves are elliptical and often covered in fine, woolly hairs, which help to retain moisture in its natural habitat. Rhododendron pubitubum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and landscapes where its unique appearance can be appreciated."
