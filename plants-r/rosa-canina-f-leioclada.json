    "intro": "Rosa canina f. leioclada, commonly known as the white dog rose, is a botanical variant of the dog rose species. It is characterized by its pale pink to white flowers, which are typically smaller than those of the typical Rosa canina. The leaves are pinnately compound, with five to seven leaflets that are usually oval and serrated. This form is often found in shaded or woodland environments, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soil. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal medicine."
