It produces aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black in color, with a sweet to tart flavor depending on the variety. The plant is characterized by its serrated leaves and dense, prickly growth habit, which helps it thrive in a variety of soil types. It is often found in hedgerows, woodlands, and along coastal areas. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in both culinary and medicinal applications."
