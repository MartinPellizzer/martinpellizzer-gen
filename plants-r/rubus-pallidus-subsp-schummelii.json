    "intro": "Rubus pallidus subsp. schummelii, commonly known as the Schummel's bramble, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its slender, thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by red, hairy berries in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in forested or rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and somewhat endangered species."
