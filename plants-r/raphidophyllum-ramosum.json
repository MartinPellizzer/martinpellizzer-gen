    "intro": "Raphidophyllum ramosum, commonly known as the coral tree, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, branched inflorescences that resemble coral, hence its common name. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or red in color. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in coastal areas or near water bodies. The coral tree is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone regions."
