    "intro": "Rinorea calcicola, commonly known as the limestone rinorea, is a perennial shrub native to the limestone regions of South America. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in the spring. It thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is adapted to dry, rocky environments. Due to its unique habitat requirements, Rinorea calcicola is considered a rare and specialized species."
