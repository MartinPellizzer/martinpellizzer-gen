    "intro": "Rauvolfia arborea, commonly known as the Indian snakeroot, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and elliptical leaves that are usually arranged in opposite pairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by capsule fruits containing ellipsoid seeds. Rauvolfia arborea is known for its medicinal properties, particularly due to the presence of reserpine, a compound used in the treatment of hypertension. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in secondary forests and along stream banks."
