    "intro": "Raveniopsis peduncularis, commonly known as the velvetleaf batik, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces showy, clustered inflorescences with small, tubular flowers that are often pink or purple in color. It thrives in humid, shady environments and is often found in moist woodlands or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
