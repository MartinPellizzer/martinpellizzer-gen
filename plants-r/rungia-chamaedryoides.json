    "intro": "Rungia chamaedryoides, commonly known as the bluebells or bluebell vine, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It is a perennial vine that typically grows along the ground or climbing supports, with heart-shaped leaves and striking blue or violet flowers. The plant produces small, cylindrical fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in some tropical gardens, though it can be invasive in certain areas."
