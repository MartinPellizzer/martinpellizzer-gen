It belongs to the Rhamnaceae family, which includes shrubs and trees known for their often spiny stems and small, often opposite leaves. The plant typically exhibits a shrub-like growth habit with woody stems and lanceolate leaves that are usually smooth and glossy. Its flowers are small and clustered, producing a subtle fragrance, and it bears small, fleshy fruits that are edible for certain wildlife species.
