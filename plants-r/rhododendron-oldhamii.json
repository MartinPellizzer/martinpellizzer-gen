    "intro": "Rhododendron oldhamii, commonly known as the oldham's rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan, China. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows to a height of 2 to 4 meters, featuring dense, leathery leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, pink to red flowers in the spring, which are characteristic of the Rhododendron genus. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers cool, moist climates. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
