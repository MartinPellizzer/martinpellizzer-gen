    "intro": "Rhus crassinervia, commonly known as the broad-veined sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Anacardiaceae family, which includes other well-known species like poison ivy and cashew. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged with prominent, broad veins. Its small, greenish-white flowers appear in clusters and are followed by red, fuzzy berries that attract birds. The bark is thick and fissured, providing a textured appearance that distinguishes it from other sumac species."
