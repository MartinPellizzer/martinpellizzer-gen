It is native to the mountainous regions of South America, particularly in Chile and Argentina. The plant is characterized by its thorny stems and dark, often hairy leaves. Its flowers are small and white, and it produces black, edible berries that are highly aromatic. However, the plant is known for its strong, unpleasant odor, which is more noticeable in its flowers than in its fruits."
