    "intro": "Rhus villosa var. obtusata, commonly known as smooth sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern and central United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically oval-shaped and have a smooth margin, distinguishing it from other sumac species. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in panicles, followed by red, fuzzy fruits that mature in the fall. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in woodland edges, thickets, and disturbed soils. Smooth sumac is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
