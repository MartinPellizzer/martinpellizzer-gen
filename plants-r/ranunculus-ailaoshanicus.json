The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in rocky or forested areas. Its leaves are palmately divided, and the flowers can range in color from white to yellow or pink, depending on the specific population. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change."
