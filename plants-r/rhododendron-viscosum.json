    "intro": "Rhododendron viscosum, commonly known as the sticky alpine rhododendron, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of eastern North America. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces a sticky resin, which gives it its common name and helps protect it from herbivores. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or forested habitats. Rhododendron viscosum plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for various wildlife species."
