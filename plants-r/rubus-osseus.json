    "intro": "Rubus osseus, commonly known as the stone raspberry, is a perennial shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, red, edible berries. The plant typically grows in moist woodlands and along stream banks, preferring partial to full shade. Its leaves are trifoliate, with a serrated edge, and its flowers are white with five petals. The berries are often used in culinary applications, though they are generally tart and less commonly consumed compared to other raspberries."
