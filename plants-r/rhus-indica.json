    "intro": "Rhus indica, commonly known as staghorn sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and often covered in fine, stinging hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in panicles, followed by red, fuzzy fruits that are a key feature of its appearance. Its leaves and fruits are used in traditional medicine and as a seasoning in some cuisines. Rhus indica thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed areas."
