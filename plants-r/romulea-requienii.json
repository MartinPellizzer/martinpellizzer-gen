It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its striking golden-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, rounded bulbs that store nutrients for the next growing season. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Due to its ornamental value and unique appearance, it is often cultivated in gardens across temperate regions."
