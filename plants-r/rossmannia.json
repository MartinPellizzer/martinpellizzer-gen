It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, palmate leaves that resemble the shape of a candle. The flowers are typically clustered in inflorescences and are often pink or red in color, adding ornamental value to the plant.

These plants are often cultivated for their aesthetic appeal and are used in ornamental gardening."
