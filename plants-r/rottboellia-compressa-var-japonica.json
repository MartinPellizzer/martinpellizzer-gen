It is characterized by its dense, low-growing foliage and rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to form thick mats. The leaves are narrow, flat, and slightly compressed, with a bluish-green coloration. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. This plant is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its attractive appearance and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
