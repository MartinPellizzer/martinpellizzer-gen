It is characterized by its thorny stems and aggregate fruits that ripen to a dark purple or black color. The plant produces small, edible berries that are often used in jams, pies, and other culinary applications. It thrives in temperate climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for both ornamental and agricultural purposes."
