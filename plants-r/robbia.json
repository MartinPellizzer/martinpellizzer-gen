    "intro": "Robbia, commonly known as the \"Everlasting\" or *Robbia globosa*, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its showy, daisy-like flowers. The plant produces bright yellow or orange petals surrounding a central disk of tubular florets, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Robbia is a perennial herb that thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or coastal areas. Its botanical name reflects its historical use in traditional medicine and its enduring presence in gardens."
