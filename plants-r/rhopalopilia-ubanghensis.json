    "intro": "Rhopalopilia ubanghensis, commonly known as the Ubanghensis cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the tropical rainforests of Central Africa. It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnate leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones typically growing on separate plants. It is adapted to low-light conditions and has a slow growth rate, making it a long-lived species. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
