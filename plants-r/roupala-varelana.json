    "intro": "Roupala varelana, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by oval, woody fruits containing seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental appearance and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain areas."
