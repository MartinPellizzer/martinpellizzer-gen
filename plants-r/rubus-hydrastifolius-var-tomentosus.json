    "intro": "Rubus hydrastifolius var. tomentosus, commonly known as the woolly blackberry, is a shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its hairy, grayish foliage and thorny stems, which are typical features of the Rubus genus. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or black when mature. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a food source for wildlife and its potential use in ecological restoration projects."
