    "intro": "Rubus pseudohostilis, commonly known as the Alaska blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the northwestern United States and southern Canada. It is characterized by its thorny stems, trifoliate leaves, and small, dark purple berries that ripen in late summer. The plant thrives in moist, temperate climates and is often found in forested areas or along streambanks. Its berries are edible, though they are generally tart and less commonly cultivated than other blackberry varieties. The plant plays an important ecological role by providing food for wildlife and supporting local biodiversity."
