    "intro": "Rudbeckia longipes, commonly known as the long-peduncled coneflower, is a perennial flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and showy yellow-orange ray florets surrounding a central disk of dark brown or black tubular flowers. The plant typically reaches heights of 3 to 6 feet and produces long, slender peduncles that support its flower heads. Rudbeckia longipes thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for native gardens and pollinator habitats. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and ornamental horticulture."
