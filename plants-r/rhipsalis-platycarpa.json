    "intro": "Rhipsalis platycarpa, commonly known as the flat-fruited mistletoe cactus, is a tropical epiphytic cactus native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by distinctive, round, fleshy fruits. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Rhipsalis platycarpa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique appearance."
