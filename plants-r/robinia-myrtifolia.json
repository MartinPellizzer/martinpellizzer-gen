    "intro": "Robinia myrtifolia, commonly known as the myrtle-leaved false acacia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and have a soft, silvery-green appearance. The plant produces fragrant, yellowish-white flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by flat, elongated pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it adaptable to various environmental conditions. Its ornamental value and ability to fix nitrogen make it a useful plant in ecological restoration projects."
