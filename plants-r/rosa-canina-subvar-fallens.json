    "intro": "Rosa canina subvar. fallens, commonly known as the bent-stem dog rose, is a flowering shrub native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often arching stems and clusters of pink to reddish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces bright red, fuzzy fruits called hips, which are rich in vitamin C and used in traditional medicine. Its leaves are compound, with five to seven oval leaflets, and it typically grows in woodland edges and scrublands. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance, providing food for birds and insects."
