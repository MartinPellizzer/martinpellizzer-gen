    "intro": "Rauvolfia reflexa, commonly known as the Indian snakeroot, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It is characterized by its woody vines and heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Rauvolfia reflexa is notable for containing alkaloids, which have been studied for potential medicinal properties."
