    "intro": "Ranunculus buekkensis, commonly known as the Buekk's buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils. The plant features a basal rosette of dark green, hairy leaves that are deeply lobed and resemble those of other ranunculus species. Its flowers are bright yellow with five to seven sepals and numerous stamens, creating a showy, cup-shaped bloom. Ranunculus buekkensis is known for its resilience to cold climates and is often found at high altitudes where few other plants can survive."
