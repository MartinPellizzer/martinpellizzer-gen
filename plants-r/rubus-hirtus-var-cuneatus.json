    "intro": "Rubus hirtus var. cuneatus, commonly known as the bristly blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its prickly stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, dark purple berries that are typically less flavorful compared to other blackberry varieties. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and thickets. This variant is valued for its hardiness and ability to spread through runners, making it a resilient shrub in various habitats."
