    "intro": "Rosa pouzinii var. insularis, commonly known as the island rose, is a rare and endemic species native to specific island environments. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink to white. The plant features thorny stems and dark green, serrated leaves that are adapted to coastal or rocky habitats. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is often considered a conservation concern."
