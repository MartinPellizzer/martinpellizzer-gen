    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus subsp. macrophyllarius, commonly known as the large-leaf buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers with five petals and large, palmately lobed leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in meadows, woodlands, and stream banks. Its foliage and flowers are often covered in fine hairs, and it blooms from late spring to early summer. The subspecies is distinguished by its notably larger leaves compared to the typical form of Ranunculus auricomus."
