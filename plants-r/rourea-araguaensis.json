    "intro": "Rourea araguaensis, commonly known as the Aragua rourea, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Venezuela. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its woody stems and large, palmate leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
