    "intro": "Rhus tridentata var. integrifolia, commonly known as the smooth sumac, is a deciduous shrub native to North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and have smooth margins, distinguishing it from other sumac species. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, followed by red, fuzzy berries that persist into the fall. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in open woodlands, prairies, and disturbed sites. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is a common species in both natural and cultivated landscapes."
