    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus subsp. campanulatus, commonly known as the bell-shaped buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It features striking, palmately lobed leaves and bright yellow flowers with five to seven petals that resemble a bell. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in meadows, woodland edges, and stream banks. It blooms from late spring to early summer, and its flowers are often visited by bees and other pollinators. The subspecies is distinguished by its more rounded petals and slightly different leaf morphology compared to the typical form of Ranunculus auricomus."
