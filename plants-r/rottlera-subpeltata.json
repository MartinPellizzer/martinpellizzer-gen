    "intro": "Rottlera subpeltata, commonly known as the dwarf rottlera, is a small evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters and features dense, dark green foliage with glossy leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. Its compact growth habit and ornamental leaves make it a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting. Rottlera subpeltata is well-suited to shady to partially sunny conditions and prefers well-drained, moist soil."
