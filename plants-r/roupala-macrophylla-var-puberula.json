    "intro": "Roupala macrophylla var. puberula, commonly known as the hairy-leafed roupala, is a species native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is a small to medium-sized tree characterized by its smooth, grey bark and elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs. The leaves are typically arranged alternately along the stems and have a distinctive silvery-green appearance. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles, followed by oval, woody fruits containing one or two seeds. This plant is often found in humid tropical forests and is valued for its ornamental qualities and potential ecological roles."
