    "intro": "Rubus gneissogenes, commonly known as the gneiss rock raspberry, is a rare shrub native to the rocky outcrops of the Appalachian Mountains. It thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic soils found on exposed gneiss rock formations. The plant produces small, edible berries that are typically red or orange in color. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges and a dark green upper surface. Due to its specialized habitat, it is considered a sensitive indicator species for rock outcrop ecosystems."
