    "intro": "Romulea monophylla, commonly known as the single-leaf glory-of-the-snow, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that bloom in spring, typically in shades of yellow and orange. The plant has a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. Its flowers are borne on a single, erect stem, which makes it a distinctive and ornamental species. Romulea monophylla is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and rockeries."
