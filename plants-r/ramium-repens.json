    "intro": "Ramium repens, commonly known as creeping red fescue, is a low-growing perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, spreading stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to form dense mats on the ground. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to reddish flowers, which are typical of the Poaceae family. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue that becomes more pronounced in the summer months. Ramium repens is often found in moist, nutrient-rich soils in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks."
