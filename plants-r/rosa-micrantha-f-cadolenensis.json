    "intro": "Rosa micrantha f. cadolenensis, commonly known as the Cadolan rose, is a rare and unique sub-species of the Rosa micrantha species. It is native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia, particularly in parts of Vietnam and Laos. This plant is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink and white. The foliage is dense and evergreen, providing a lush backdrop to its blossoms. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a botanical curiosity and is often sought after by horticulturists and botanists."
