    "intro": "Rubus stenopetalus, commonly known as the narrow-petaled blackberry, is a species of bramble native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its prickly stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, dark red to black berries that are typically consumed by birds and other wildlife. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, loamy soils. The flowers are usually white or pale pink, and they bloom in early spring before the foliage develops."
