    "intro": "Rhinorchis smithii, commonly known as the Smith's rhinorchis, is a rare orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, hairy stems and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow and green. The plant prefers shaded, moist habitats and is often found in forest understories. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by specific insects, and it has a short flowering period. Due to habitat loss, Rhinorchis smithii is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
