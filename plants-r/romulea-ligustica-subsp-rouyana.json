    "intro": "Romulea ligustica subsp. rouyana, commonly known as the Rouyana sand orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring. The plant is adapted to grow in sandy or rocky soils, often in open habitats such as coastal dunes or dry grasslands. It is part of the Iridaceae family and is known for its ability to thrive in arid conditions. Due to habitat loss, it is considered threatened in some regions and is protected in several European countries."
