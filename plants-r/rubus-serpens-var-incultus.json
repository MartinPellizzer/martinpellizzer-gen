It is a species of bramble native to parts of eastern North America, characterized by its trailing growth habit and thorny stems. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or yellow when mature. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. This variant is often found in woodlands and along stream banks, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife."
