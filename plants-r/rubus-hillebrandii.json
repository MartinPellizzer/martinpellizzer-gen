    "intro": "Rubus hillebrandii, commonly known as the Hillebrand's blackberry, is a species of brambles native to the western United States. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves, typical of the Rubus genus. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant."
