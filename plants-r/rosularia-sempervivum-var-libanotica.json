    "intro": "Rosularia sempervivum var. libanotica, commonly known as the Lebanese mountain rose, is a succulent plant characterized by its compact, rosette-forming growth habit. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white or grayish hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or purple during the spring or early summer. Native to the Mediterranean region, it thrives in well-draining soil and full sun. It is a hardy perennial that is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
