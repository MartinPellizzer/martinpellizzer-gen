    "intro": "Rubus quartinianus, commonly known as the alpine blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves, typical of the Rubus genus. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are often used in local cuisines and traditional medicine. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitats."
