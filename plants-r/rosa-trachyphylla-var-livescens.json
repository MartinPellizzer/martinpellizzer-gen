    "intro": "Rosa trachyphylla var. livescens, commonly known as the roughleaf rose, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its thick, glandular, and often hairy stems and leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink to red, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually elliptical or ovate, with a rough texture and a strong, spicy scent. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and unique foliage."
