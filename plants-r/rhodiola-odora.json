It belongs to the family Crassulaceae and is characterized by its succulent, often fleshy leaves and clusters of small, pink or white flowers. The plant is adapted to cold climates and can thrive in poor soil conditions, making it a hardy species. Its roots are used in traditional medicine for their purported adaptogenic properties. Rhodiola odora is also valued for its aromatic foliage, which releases a pleasant scent when crushed."
