    "intro": "Rubus bayeri subsp. dichromus, commonly known as the Bayser's blackberry, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and trifoliate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, dark red berries that are typically harvested in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
