    "intro": "Richardsonia, commonly known as the mountain daisy, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. It is native to the high-altitude regions of South America, particularly in the Andes. The plants are characterized by their compact, cushion-like growth form and small, daisy-like flowers. They typically thrive in cool, moist environments and are often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Richardsonia species are valued for their ornamental appeal and ecological importance in their native ecosystems."
