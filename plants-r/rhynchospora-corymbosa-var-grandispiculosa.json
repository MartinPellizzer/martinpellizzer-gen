    "intro": "Rhynchospora corymbosa var. grandispiculosa, commonly known as the tall spike-rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It features a dense, grass-like appearance with slender, cylindrical stems that often grow in clusters. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, three-lobed flowers. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in moist habitats. This variety is distinguished by its elongated, spiky flower clusters and is often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds."
