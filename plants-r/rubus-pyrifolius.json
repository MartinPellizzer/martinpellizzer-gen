    "intro": "Rubus pyrifolius, commonly known as the apple-leaved blackberry, is a species of bramble native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves that resemble those of the apple tree, with five to seven leaflets. The plant produces small, dark red berries that are edible but often have a tart flavor. It thrives in moist, wooded areas and is often found in the understory of forests. Rubus pyrifolius plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing food for wildlife and supporting pollinators."
