    "intro": "Rinorea kemoensis, commonly known as the Kemo's rinorea, is a flowering plant native to the rainforests of western Africa. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its soft, hairy leaves and showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in clusters. It typically grows as an understory plant, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Rinorea kemoensis is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
