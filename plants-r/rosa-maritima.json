    "intro": "Rosa maritima, commonly known as sea rose, is a coastal shrub native to the northern Atlantic coast of North America. It is characterized by its slender, thorny stems and narrow, elliptical leaves that are adapted to salty, windy environments. The plant produces showy pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its holly-like leaves remain green throughout the year, providing evergreen structure to coastal landscapes. Rosa maritima is well-suited for dune stabilization due to its deep root system and salt tolerance."
