    "intro": "Raritebe palicoureoides var. antioquianum, commonly known as the Antioquian rareleaf, is a unique species native to the cloud forests of Colombia. It is characterized by its striking, waxy leaves that exhibit a deep green color with a subtle iridescence. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically blooming during the wet season. It thrives in high humidity and partial shade, making it a challenging but rewarding plant for cultivation. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
