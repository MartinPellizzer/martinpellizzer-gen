It is a cross between Rosa damascena and Rosa gallica, resulting in a wide variety of colors and bloom forms. The plant typically grows as an upright shrub with thorny stems and glossy, dark green leaves. Its flowers are usually single or double, with five to many petals, and bloom repeatedly throughout the growing season. Rosa \u00d7 pulcherrima thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, requiring regular pruning to maintain its shape and promote abundant flowering."
