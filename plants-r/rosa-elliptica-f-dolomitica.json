    "intro": "Rosa elliptica f. dolomitica, commonly known as the Dolomite rose, is a compact, shrub-like species native to the Dolomites in Italy. It features dark green, elliptical leaves with a slightly hairy texture, and produces clusters of small, fragrant pink flowers in late spring. The plant is adapted to high-altitude environments, thriving in well-drained, calcareous soils. Its horticultural value lies in its ornamental appeal and hardiness, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays. This cultivar is also noted for its resistance to common rose diseases, enhancing its suitability for garden cultivation."
