    "intro": "Roegneria hirtiflora, commonly known as the hairy floret wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, hairy foliage that distinguishes it from other grasses in the genus. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. Roegneria hirtiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in marginal habitats."
