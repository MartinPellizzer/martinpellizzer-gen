It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is native to certain regions of South America. The plant exhibits a rhynchostele, a type of vascular arrangement that is rare in ferns, giving it a specialized structure for water and nutrient transport. Its fronds are typically narrow and linear, with a delicate, feathery appearance. Rhynchostele stellata thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in humid tropical forests."
