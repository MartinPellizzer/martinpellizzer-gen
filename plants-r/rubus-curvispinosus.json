    "intro": "Rubus curvispinosus, commonly known as the curved spine blackberry, is a species of brambles native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its thorny stems and dark purple to black berries that ripen in the fall. The plant typically grows in moist woodlands and along stream banks, preferring partial shade. Its leaves are compound, with three to five leaflets that are serrated and have a rough texture. The flowers are white and fragrant, appearing in the spring before the leaves fully develop."
