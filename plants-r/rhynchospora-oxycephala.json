    "intro": "Rhynchospora oxycephala, commonly known as the sharp-headed flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy habitats in the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, commonly known as the sedge family, and is characterized by its triangular stems and dense, grass-like foliage. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically wind-pollinated. Rhynchospora oxycephala thrives in saturated soils and plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems. Its presence is often an indicator of healthy, undisturbed wetland environments."
