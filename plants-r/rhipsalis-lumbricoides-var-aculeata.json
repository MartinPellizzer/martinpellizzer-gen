It features slender, branching stems covered with small, spiny tubercles that give it its common name. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom during the summer months. Its fruit is a red, fleshy berry that contains several seeds. This variety is well adapted to humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees in tropical rainforests."
