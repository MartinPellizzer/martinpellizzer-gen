    "intro": "Ricinocarpos trichophorus, commonly known as the hairy leaf spurge, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its succulent, hairy stems and alternate, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are often surrounded by specialized structures called cyathia. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along coastal areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in regions outside its native range."
