    "intro": "Rhododendron cumberlandense, commonly known as the Cumberland rhododendron, is a rare and endangered species native to the Appalachian Mountains in the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in rocky or mountainous terrain. Its botanical features include leathery leaves and a compact, shrub-like growth habit. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
