    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 adenanthoides, commonly known as the evergreen blackberry, is a hybrid shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California and northern Baja California. It is characterized by its dense, thorny growth habit and dark green, leathery leaves that remain throughout the year. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically black when ripe, though they may vary in color depending on the variety. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in coastal scrub and chaparral habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
