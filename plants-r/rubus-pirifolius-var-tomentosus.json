    "intro": "Rubus pirifolius var. tomentosus, commonly known as the woolly blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant characterized by its dense, white tomentum covering its stems and leaves. It is a shrub native to eastern Asia, particularly China, and thrives in temperate climates. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically smaller than those of other blackberry species. Its foliage is usually trifoliate, with serrated leaflets, and it often grows in woodland or shaded areas. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been cultivated for both its berries and its horticultural features."
