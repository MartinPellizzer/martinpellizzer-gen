    "intro": "Ranunculus resvoll-holmseniae, commonly known as the Holmsenia buttercup, is a rare and striking member of the Ranunculaceae family. It is characterized by its showy, brightly colored flowers, typically in shades of yellow, orange, or red, with a central cluster of stamens. The plant has palmately divided leaves that are finely toothed, and it often grows in moist, shaded environments. Native to specific regions in South America, it is a herbaceous perennial with a short growing season. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
