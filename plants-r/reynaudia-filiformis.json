    "intro": "Reynaudia filiformis, commonly known as the slender chain fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, narrow fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces sporangia in clusters along the undersides of its fronds, which are typically found on the stems rather than the leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Reynaudia filiformis is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
