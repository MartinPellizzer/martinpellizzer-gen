It belongs to the Araceae family and is characterized by its elongated, narrow leaves that are often variegated with white or cream markings. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically hidden within a spadix surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. Rhaphidophora tenuis is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and ability to thrive in low-light conditions. It requires well-draining soil and regular watering to maintain its health and growth."
