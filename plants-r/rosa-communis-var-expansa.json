    "intro": "Rosa communis var. expansa, commonly known as the broadleaf rose, is a cultivar of the Rosa genus characterized by its large, showy flowers and robust growth habit. It features compound leaves with multiple leaflets, typically arranged in an odd-pinnate pattern, and produces fragrant, pink to white blooms. The plant is perennial, thriving in temperate climates and requiring well-drained soil and full sun exposure. Its thorny stems and dense foliage make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and hedging. This variety is also valued for its use in perfumery and as a source of edible rose hips."
