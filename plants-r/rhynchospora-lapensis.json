    "intro": "Rhynchospora lapensis, commonly known as Lapland sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, nutrient-poor soils, often in tundra or heathland environments. The plant has slender, triangular stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny greenish or brownish flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, contributing to its overall sedge appearance. Rhynchospora lapensis plays a role in stabilizing soil in harsh climates and is adapted to survive in low temperatures and short growing seasons."
