    "intro": "Rhopaloblaste singaporensis, commonly known as the Singapore rhopaloblast, is a rare and endemic flowering plant found exclusively in the tropical regions of Singapore. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers with bright yellow petals. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically in the undergrowth of lowland rainforests. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires protection to ensure its survival."
