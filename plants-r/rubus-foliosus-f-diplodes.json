    "intro": "Rubus foliosus f. diplodes, commonly known as the thick-leaved blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant characterized by its dense, dark foliage. This form exhibits larger, more robust leaves compared to the typical Rubus foliosus, which contributes to its distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, dark purple berries that are typically harvested in late summer. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland or shaded areas. Its botanical features make it a unique subject for horticultural and ecological studies."
