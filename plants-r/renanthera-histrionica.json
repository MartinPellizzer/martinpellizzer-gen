    "intro": "Renanthera histrionica, commonly known as the showy flame orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant, showy flowers that come in shades of red, orange, and yellow, often with contrasting purple or brown markings. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, supporting its growth in humid, shaded environments. Its roots are epiphytic, allowing it to grow on trees or other plants without soil. Renanthera histrionica is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated for its striking floral display."
