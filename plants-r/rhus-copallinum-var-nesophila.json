    "intro": "Rhus copallinum var. nesophila, commonly known as the southern waxleaf sumac, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically alternate and pinnately arranged, with serrated margins. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in panicles during the spring, followed by red, fuzzy berries that are attractive to birds. Its leaves are often covered in a fine, waxy coating, giving them a distinctive silvery appearance. This variety is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in woodland edges and moist, well-drained soils."
