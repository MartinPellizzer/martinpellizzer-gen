    "intro": "Rubus hirtus subvar. chamaemorifolius, commonly known as the creeping raspberry, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It features compound leaves with serrated edges and small, red-orange flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces edible berries that are typically red or yellow, though they are often tart and less commonly consumed than other raspberries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and stream banks. This subvariety is characterized by its low-growing habit and is sometimes used in horticulture for erosion control."
