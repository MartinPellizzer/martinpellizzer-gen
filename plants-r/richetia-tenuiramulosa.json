    "intro": "Richetia tenuiramulosa, commonly known as the slender-leafed richetia, is a rare and specialized plant native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes plants like carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its small, white flowers are clustered in umbels, a common feature among members of its family. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Richetia tenuiramulosa is considered a vulnerable species."
