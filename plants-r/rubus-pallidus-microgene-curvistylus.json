It is characterized by its slender stems and small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces edible berries, though they are typically small and tart. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it has a woody structure that allows it to persist through seasonal changes."
