It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in clusters, adding a vibrant touch to its natural habitat. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and thrives in coastal environments with high salinity. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. Rotheca sansibarensis is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
