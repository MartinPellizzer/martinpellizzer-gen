    "intro": "Ranunculus dubius, commonly known as the water crowfoot, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers with five petals and a hairy, upright stem. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, such as ponds, streams, and ditches. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a distinctive lobed structure that helps in water retention. Ranunculus dubius is often found in shallow water environments, where it plays a role in aquatic ecosystems."
