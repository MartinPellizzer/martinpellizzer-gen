    "intro": "Rosa \u00d7 dumetorum var. saveryi, commonly known as the Savery's shrub rose, is a compact, sprawling shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features dense, thorny stems and small, oval-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces fragrant, semi-double to double flowers in shades of pink to red, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It is well adapted to poor, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in cooler climates."
