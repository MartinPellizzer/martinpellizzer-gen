    "intro": "Rubus amphichlorus var. candicans, commonly known as the golden raspberry, is a rare and unique species within the Rubus genus. It is characterized by its striking golden-yellow flowers and edible, tart fruits that are highly sought after in niche markets. The plant thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and partial shade, often found in forest understories. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the stems are covered in dense, prickly bristles. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a botanical curiosity and a subject of conservation interest."
