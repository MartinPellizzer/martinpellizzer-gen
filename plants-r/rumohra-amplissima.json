    "intro": "Rumohra amplissima, commonly known as the giant horsetail, is a member of the Equisetaceae family and is native to New Zealand. It is a perennial plant that grows in moist, shaded environments, often near streams or in wetlands. The plant features a tall, unbranched stem with whorls of small, needle-like leaves. Its spore-producing structures, called strobila, are located at the top of the stem. Rumohra amplissima is notable for its ancient lineage, dating back to the Carboniferous period, and is considered a living fossil."
