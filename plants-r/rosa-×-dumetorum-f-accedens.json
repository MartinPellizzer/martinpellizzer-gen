    "intro": "Rosa \u00d7 dumetorum f. accedens, commonly known as the creeping rose, is a hybrid shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with thorny stems that often lie close to the ground. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink to white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are compound, consisting of five to seven oval-shaped leaflets, and are covered in fine, silky hairs. This variety is often used in landscaping for its hardy nature and ability to form dense, spreading mats."
