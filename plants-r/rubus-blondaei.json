    "intro": "Rubus blondaei, commonly known as the blondaei raspberry, is a species of bramble native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and thorny stems, typical of many Rubus species. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or yellow in color, depending on the variety. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it thrives in well-drained, acidic soils. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and less-studied member of the Rubus genus."
