    "intro": "Raphanistrum innocuum var. segetum, commonly known as wild garlic or garlic mustard, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white, four-petaled flowers. The plant produces smooth, elongated seed pods that contain numerous tiny, black seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rapid growth and prolific seed production make it an invasive species in many regions."
