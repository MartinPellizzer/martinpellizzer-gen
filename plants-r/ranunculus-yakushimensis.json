It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family, characterized by its showy, often brightly colored flowers. The plant features delicate, palmate leaves and produces small, cup-shaped flowers in shades of white, yellow, or orange. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
