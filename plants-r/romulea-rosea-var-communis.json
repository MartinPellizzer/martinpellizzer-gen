    "intro": "Romulea rosea var. communis, commonly known as the common romulea, is a bulbous perennial plant native to southern Africa. It produces striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often with a red throat. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge in early spring. The species is notable for its ability to store water in its bulbs, allowing it to survive in arid conditions."
