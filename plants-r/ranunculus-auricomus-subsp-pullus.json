    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus subsp. pullus, commonly known as the golden buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It features showy, yellow flowers with five to eight petal-like sepals, which are often mistaken for true petals. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a distinctive hairy texture. The subspecies pullus is distinguished by its slightly smaller flowers and more compact growth habit compared to the typical form of R. auricomus."
