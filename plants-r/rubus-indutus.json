    "intro": "Rubus indutus, commonly known as the smooth raspberry, is a species of bramble native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its thornless stems and small, aggregate fruits that ripen to a deep red color. The plant produces white, five-petaled flowers in the spring, which are followed by the development of its edible berries. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges and a soft, hairy texture. Rubus indutus thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
