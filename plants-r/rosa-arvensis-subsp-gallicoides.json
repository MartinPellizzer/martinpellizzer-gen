    "intro": "Rosa arvensis subsp. gallicoides, commonly known as the Gallic mouse-ear rose, is a perennial shrub native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, thornless stems and small, oval-shaped leaves with a distinctive glandular texture. The flowers are typically pink or white, appearing in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in moist, often nitrogen-rich soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows. This subspecies is notable for its ornamental value and its role in supporting pollinators."
