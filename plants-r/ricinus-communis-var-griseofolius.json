    "intro": "Ricinus communis var. griseofolius, commonly known as the gray-leaved castor bean, is a variant of the castor oil plant characterized by its distinctive grayish-green foliage. It is an annual herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Africa. The plant produces large, palmate leaves and spiny capsules containing toxic seeds. It is cultivated for its oil-rich seeds, though caution is necessary due to the presence of ricin. Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and potentially hazardous."
