    "intro": "Rosa coriifolia f. cenisia, commonly known as the pink sand rose, is a compact shrub characterized by its dense, thornless growth habit. It features small, oval-shaped leaves with a slightly serrated edge, and its most striking feature is the profusion of pink to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The flowers are typically borne in clusters, adding a delicate and ornamental appearance to the plant. It is native to China and is valued for its ornamental qualities in gardens. This form is a naturally occurring variant of Rosa coriifolia, distinguished by its reduced floral coloration."
