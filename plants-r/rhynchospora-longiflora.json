    "intro": "Rhynchospora longiflora, commonly known as the long-flowered spike-rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges and rushes, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with three-ranked leaves. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that bear tiny, three-lobed flowers, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Rhynchospora longiflora thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swampy or pond edges. It plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wetland organisms."
