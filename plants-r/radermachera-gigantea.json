    "intro": "Radermachera gigantea, commonly known as the giant everleaf, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, glossy, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 cm in length. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by dark blue, berry-like fruits. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
