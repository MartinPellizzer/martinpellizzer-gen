    "intro": "Rhus carolinense, commonly known as staghorn sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 3 to 5 inches long and have serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, fuzzy berries that persist into the winter. Its bark is thick and rough, with a distinctive, rugged texture that gives it its common name. Rhus carolinense is often found in open woods, along roadsides, and in disturbed areas, and it plays a role in supporting local wildlife."
