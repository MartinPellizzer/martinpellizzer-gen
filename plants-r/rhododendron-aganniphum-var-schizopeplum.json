It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and showy, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in high-altitude habitats, preferring well-drained, acidic soils. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, providing a striking contrast to its vibrant floral display. This variety is notable for its hardiness and ability to thrive in cold, harsh environments."
