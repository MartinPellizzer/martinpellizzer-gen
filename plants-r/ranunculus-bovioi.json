    "intro": "Ranunculus bovioi, commonly known as the Bovio's buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family, characterized by its showy, often yellow or white flowers. The plant features a basal rosette of leaves that are typically palmately lobed, and its flowers are usually solitary, with five to ten sepals that resemble petals. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species."
