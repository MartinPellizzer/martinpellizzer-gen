    "intro": "Rhododendron viscosum var. tomentosum, commonly known as the wooly alpine rhododendron, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive, fluffy appearance. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in high-altitude forests and alpine meadows. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
