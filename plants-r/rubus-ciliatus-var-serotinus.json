    "intro": "Rubus ciliatus var. serotinus, commonly known as the late-fruited bramble, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its prickly stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that ripen later in the growing season compared to other Rubus species. It thrives in moist, wooded areas and is often found in mixed hardwood forests. Botanically, it is distinguished by its pale yellow flowers and the presence of glandular hairs on its foliage."
