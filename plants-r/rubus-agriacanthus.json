    "intro": "Rubus agriacanthus, commonly known as the agricane thornberry, is a species of bramble native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces edible berries that are typically red or black in color, though they are often tart and less commonly consumed compared to other Rubus species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and hedgerows. The leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the plant is known for its hardy nature and ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative growth."
