    "intro": "Rosa operta, commonly known as the closed rose, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its tightly closed petals that remain sealed until the flower opens, typically in response to environmental stimuli such as temperature changes. The plant is native to parts of Asia, including China and Japan, and thrives in temperate climates. Its flowers are usually pink or red, with a delicate fragrance, and it produces small, edible berries. Rosa operta is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
