    "intro": "Ranunculus dahuricus, commonly known as the Siberian buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to temperate regions of Asia. It features delicate, palmately divided leaves and bright yellow flowers with five to nine petals. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It is characterized by its short, stout stems and is often found in the wild as a component of the undergrowth. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain areas."
