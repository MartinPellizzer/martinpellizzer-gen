    "intro": "Roscoea cautleyoides, commonly known as the Himalayan ginger, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It features striking, lance-shaped leaves that are often deeply veined and emit a mild, spicy aroma. The plant produces tall, upright flower spikes bearing orange-red to yellow-orange bracts, which are not true flowers but serve to attract pollinators. It thrives in cool, moist environments with partial shade and well-drained soil. Due to its ornamental value and unique appearance, it is cultivated in gardens and botanical collections worldwide."
