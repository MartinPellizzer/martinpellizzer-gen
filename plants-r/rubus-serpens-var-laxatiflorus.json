    "intro": "Rubus serpens var. laxatiflorus, commonly known as the slender trailing blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to parts of South America. It is a shrub characterized by its prostrate growth habit and hairy stems. The leaves are typically oval-shaped with serrated edges and a pale underside. Its flowers are small, white, and clustered in dense inflorescences, often blooming in late spring. The fruit, though edible, is generally smaller and less flavorful compared to other blackberry varieties."
