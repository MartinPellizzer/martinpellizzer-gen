    "intro": "Restio complanatus, commonly known as the flat-leaved restio, is a perennial grass-like plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Restionaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal and sandy environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Its structure resembles that of a grass, but it has distinct floral features that set it apart from true grasses. Restio complanatus is often found in fynbos vegetation, contributing to the biodiversity of its native habitat."
