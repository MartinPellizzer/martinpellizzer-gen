    "intro": "Rotala wallichii, commonly known as the water lettuce or Indian water lettuce, is a floating aquatic plant native to Asia. It has a rosette-like structure with broad, waxy leaves that are often covered in a fine, white coating. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellowish in color. It thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments and is often found in ponds and lakes. Its rapid growth rate makes it both a useful water purifier and a potential invasive species in non-native habitats."
