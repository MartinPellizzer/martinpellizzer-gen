    "intro": "Rubus clandestinus, commonly known as the secret raspberry, is a species of bramble native to the temperate regions of Europe. It is characterized by its prickly stems and clusters of small, edible red berries. The plant typically grows in woodland edges and disturbed soils, thriving in partial shade. Its flowers are white with five petals and appear in early summer. The plant's name reflects its elusive nature, as it is often found in remote or hidden locations."
