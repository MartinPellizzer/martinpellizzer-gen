    "intro": "Rubus vestitus f. leucanthemus, commonly known as the white-flowered raspberry, is a botanical variant of the raspberry plant characterized by its pale or white flowers. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is native to certain regions of Europe. The plant features thorny stems and compound leaves, typical of the Rubus genus. Its flowers are smaller and less showy compared to the typical raspberry, but they are still attractive to pollinators. This form is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its unique floral appearance."
