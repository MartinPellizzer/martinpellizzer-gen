    "intro": "Rhinanthus deminutus, commonly known as the dwarf yellow-rattle, is a small, annual plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It is characterized by its slender stems and small, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom from June to August. This hemiparasitic plant attaches to the roots of grasses and other plants, drawing water and nutrients from its host. It typically grows in grasslands, meadows, and disturbed soils, often in areas with well-drained soil. Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and declining species in many parts of its range."
