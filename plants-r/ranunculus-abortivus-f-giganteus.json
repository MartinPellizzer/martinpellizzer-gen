    "intro": "Ranunculus abortivus f. giganteus, commonly known as the giant buttercup, is a variant of the common buttercup characterized by its larger, showy flowers. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, calcareous soils, often found in meadows and along stream banks. The plant features palmately divided leaves and yellow flowers with numerous stamens, which are attractive to pollinators. Its foliage is covered in fine hairs, and the stems are usually hairy as well. This form is notable for its increased size compared to the typical species, making it a striking addition to gardens and natural habitats."
