    "intro": "Rosa badiella, commonly known as the pink lady's mantle, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its evergreen foliage, which consists of dark green, leathery leaves with a waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Rosa badiella is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. It prefers well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight."
