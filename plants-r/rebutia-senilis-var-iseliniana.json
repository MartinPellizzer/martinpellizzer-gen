    "intro": "Rebutia senilis var. iseliniana, commonly known as the silver star cactus, is a low-growing, spineless cactus native to South America. It features a compact, rounded shape with a smooth, pale green to bluish-green stem. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its succulent stems store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. It is well-suited for rock gardens and requires minimal water and well-draining soil."
