    "intro": "Rinorea subauriculata, commonly known as the golden bell tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators like bees and birds. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with a smooth texture and a slightly waxy surface. Its bark is typically smooth and light-colored, while the wood is lightweight and used in traditional crafts. Rinorea subauriculata thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland forests."
