    "intro": "Rhaponticoides mykalea, commonly known as the Mykalean rhapontic, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, umbellate inflorescence. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves and produces small, white to pale yellow flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, woodland habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
