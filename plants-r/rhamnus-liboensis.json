    "intro": "Rhamnus liboensis, commonly known as the Ethiopian buckthorn, is a shrub native to the highlands of Ethiopia. It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by dark blue berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in rocky or mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
