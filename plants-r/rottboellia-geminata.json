    "intro": "Rottboellia geminata, commonly known as the twinleaf grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its clumping growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often arranged in pairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks. Rottboellia geminata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
