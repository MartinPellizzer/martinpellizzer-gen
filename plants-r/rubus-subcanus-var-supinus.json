It is characterized by its thorny stems and small, aggregate fruits that develop from clusters of drupes. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges and a hairy underside. The flowers are white and produced in clusters, followed by the edible, red berries that ripen in late summer."
