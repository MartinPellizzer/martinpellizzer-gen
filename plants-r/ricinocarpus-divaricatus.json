    "intro": "Ricinocarpus divaricatus, commonly known as the sea hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Indo-Pacific. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils near the shoreline. The plant has palmate leaves with five to seven lobes and produces showy yellow or orange flowers. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. It plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for marine and terrestrial wildlife."
