    "intro": "Ruschia rupicola, commonly known as the rock Ruschia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features compact, dense foliage with bright green, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces clusters of small, vibrant red flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Due to its drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for low-maintenance landscaping."
