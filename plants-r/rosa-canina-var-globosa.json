It is characterized by its rounded, globular shape, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant pink or white flowers in early summer, followed by red-orange hips that are rich in vitamin C. It is a deciduous shrub that thrives in full sun and well-drained soil. The species is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in traditional medicine."
