It is native to southern Africa and is characterized by its palmate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels. Ricinus rugosus is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its distinctive foliage. However, it is important to note that all parts of the plant contain toxic compounds and should be handled with care."
