It has broad, waxy leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern on the water surface. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white in color. Rotala submersa is often used in aquariums and ponds for its ornamental value and ability to provide habitat for aquatic life. However, it can become invasive in certain water bodies if not managed properly."
