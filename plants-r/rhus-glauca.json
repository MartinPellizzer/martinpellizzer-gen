    "intro": "Rhus glauca, commonly known as smooth sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically composed of 11 to 31 pairs of oval, serrated leaflets. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by red, fuzzy fruits that mature in the fall. Smooth sumac is often found in dry, open habitats such as woodlands, fields, and along roadsides. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used historically for medicinal and dye purposes."
