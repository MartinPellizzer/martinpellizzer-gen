    "intro": "Ruellia repens, commonly known as creeping ruellia, is a low-growing herbaceous perennial native to the Americas. It features prostrate or trailing stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically blue or purple in color, arranged in clusters. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Ruellia repens thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, streambanks, and disturbed areas."
