    "intro": "Rosa \u00d7 dumetorum var. interposita, commonly known as the alpine rose or shrub rose, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features dense, dark green foliage and produces clusters of fragrant, semi-double pink flowers in early summer. The plant is characterized by its short, stiff stems and its ability to thrive in well-drained, acidic soils. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and hardiness in cool climates. This variety is particularly valued for its ability to form dense thickets and its resistance to common rose diseases."
