    "intro": "Rosa glauca var. macrocarpa, commonly known as the large-fruited bluebush rose, is a shrub-like plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and clusters of pale blue to lavender flowers. The leaves are typically gray-green, covered in a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Its fruit, a red, fleshy rose hip, is notable for its size and is often used in herbal remedies. This plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, adapting well to poor soil conditions."
