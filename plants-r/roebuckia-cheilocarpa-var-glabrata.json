    "intro": "Roebuckia cheilocarpa var. glabrata, commonly known as the smooth-seeded roebuckia, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and bright yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant features small, elliptical leaves that are smooth and glabrous, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in xeriscaped gardens and rockeries."
