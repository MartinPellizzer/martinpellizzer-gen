    "intro": "Rhipsalis gibberula, commonly known as the woolly mistletoe, is a species of epiphytic cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its soft, fuzzy stems that are often covered in a white, waxy coating. The plant produces small, pale green flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by red berries that are edible for some animals. Rhipsalis gibberula thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees in tropical rainforests. Its unique appearance and ability to climb make it a distinctive member of the Cactaceae family."
