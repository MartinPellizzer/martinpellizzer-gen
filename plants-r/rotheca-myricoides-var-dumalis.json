    "intro": "Rotheca myricoides var. dumalis, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its small, linear leaves and clusters of tiny, pale blue to purple flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Its botanical features include glandular hairs on the stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss. It plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for native insects."
