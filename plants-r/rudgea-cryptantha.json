    "intro": "Rudgea cryptantha, commonly known as the ghostflower, is a unique flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its striking, pale blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a short, woody stem and hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. Rudgea cryptantha is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. Its limited geographic range and specific habitat requirements make it a rare and ecologically significant species."
