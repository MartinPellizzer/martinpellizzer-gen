    "intro": "Rhus typhina, commonly known as staghorn sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are usually 5 to 9 pairs of oval, serrated leaflets. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red, fuzzy berries in the fall. Its bark is rough and furrowed, with a distinctive, rugged appearance. Rhus typhina is often found in dry, disturbed soils and is adapted to full sun conditions."
