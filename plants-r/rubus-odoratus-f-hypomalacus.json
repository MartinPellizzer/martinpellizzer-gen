    "intro": "Rubus odoratus f. hypomalacus, commonly known as the fragrant raspberry. This plant is a botanical variant of the common raspberry, characterized by its distinctive floral fragrance. It typically grows in temperate climates and thrives in well-drained soils. The leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the flowers are pinkish-white with a strong, sweet aroma. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and edible fruits, which are smaller and more intensely flavored than those of the standard Rubus odoratus."
