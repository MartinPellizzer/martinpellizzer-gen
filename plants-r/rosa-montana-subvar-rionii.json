    "intro": "Rosa montana subvar. rionii, commonly known as the Rion Mountain rose, is a compact shrub native to the Appalachian Mountains. It features dense, thornless stems and produces clusters of fragrant, semi-double pink flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant has dark green, glossy foliage that remains attractive throughout the growing season. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its hardiness and ability to bloom reliably in cooler climates."
