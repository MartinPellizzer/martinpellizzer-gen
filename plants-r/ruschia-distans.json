    "intro": "Ruschia distans, commonly known as the silver leaf Ruschia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white powder, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Its compact size and striking foliage make it an attractive addition to arid landscapes."
