    "intro": "Ranunculus repens var. tropicus, commonly known as the tropical creeping buttercup, is a variant of the creeping buttercup species native to tropical regions. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as wetlands and stream banks. The plant features small, bright yellow flowers with five petals and numerous stamens, typical of the Ranunculaceae family. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three deeply lobed leaflets, and it often spreads via rhizomes. This variant is adapted to warmer climates and is less commonly cultivated than its temperate relatives."
