    "intro": "Rhysolepis tuberosa, commonly known as the tuberous rhysolepis, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tuberous roots, which store nutrients and water, allowing it to survive in nutrient-poor soils. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white, typically blooming in spring. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often hairy, with a waxy texture. Rhysolepis tuberosa is valued in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties and is also cultivated for ornamental purposes."
