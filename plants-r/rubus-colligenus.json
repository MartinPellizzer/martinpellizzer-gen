    "intro": "Rubus colligenus, commonly known as the alpine blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, dark red to black berries that are typically harvested in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species."
