    "intro": "Rhododendron afghanicum, commonly known as the Afghan rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Afghanistan and northern Pakistan. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and showy, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, often in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, providing a striking contrast to the vibrant floral displays. Rhododendron afghanicum is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological diversity of its native environment."
