It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces elongated, hairy pods containing flat, edible seeds. It is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fallow fields. Rhynchosia faginea is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability and use in agroforestry systems."
