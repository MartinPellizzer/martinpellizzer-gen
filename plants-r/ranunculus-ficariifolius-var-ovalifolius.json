    "intro": "Ranunculus ficariifolius var. ovalifolius, commonly known as the oval-leaved water crowfoot, is a aquatic plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in shallow freshwater habitats such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. The plant has finely divided, oval-shaped leaves that float on the water surface, with roots submerged in the substrate. Its flowers are usually yellow or white, with five petals and numerous stamens, typical of the Ranunculaceae family. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various water organisms."
