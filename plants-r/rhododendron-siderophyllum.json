    "intro": "Rhododendron siderophyllum, commonly known as the ironleaf rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage that exhibits a distinctive bluish-green hue, which becomes more pronounced in the shade. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to deep red, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and requires partial to full shade for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is often cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
