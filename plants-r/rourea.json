    "intro": "Rourea, commonly known as the velvetleaf or silverleaf, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Euphorbiaceae. These plants are characterized by their thick, often waxy leaves that can have a distinctive silvery or velvety appearance. Rourea species are typically shrubs or small trees, native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. They produce small, clustered flowers that are often surrounded by colorful bracts, which can be showy and attract pollinators. The genus includes several species, some of which are cultivated for their ornamental value in gardens."
