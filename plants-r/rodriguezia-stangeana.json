    "intro": "Rodriguezia stangeana, commonly known as the Stange's rodriguezia, is a member of the Malvaceae family, native to the rainforests of northern South America. It is a striking plant characterized by its large, palmate leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in diameter. The plant produces showy, pinkish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, attracting various pollinators. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistent moisture and well-draining soil. Due to its ornamental value and limited natural range, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
