    "intro": "Ruscus reticulatus, commonly known as the net-leaf bugleweed, is a low-growing evergreen perennial shrub native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features dense, fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers in late spring, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to woodland and coastal habitats."
