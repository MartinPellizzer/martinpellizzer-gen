    "intro": "Rhynchostele cordata, commonly known as the heartleaf arrowroot, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Araceae and is characterized by its distinctive cordate (heart-shaped) leaves. The plant has a rhizomatous stem system that allows it to spread vegetatively. Its flowers are typically small and clustered in an inflorescence called a spadix, which is enclosed by a modified leaf called a spathe. Rhynchostele cordata is valued for its starchy roots, which are used in traditional cuisine and medicine."
