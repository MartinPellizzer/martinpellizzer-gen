    "intro": "Rosa canina var. scabra, commonly known as the bristly dog rose, is a variant of the common dog rose. It is characterized by its rough, bristly stems and leaves, which distinguish it from the typical form. The plant produces fragrant pink or white flowers in the spring, followed by orange-red hips in the autumn. It is a deciduous shrub that thrives in temperate climates and is often found in hedgerows and woodland edges. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in herbal medicine."
