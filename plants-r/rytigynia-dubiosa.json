    "intro": "Rytigynia dubiosa, commonly known as the Brazilian redwood, is a rare and endangered species native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 20 meters tall, characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in panicles, which are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and role in the biodiversity of its native habitat. Due to habitat loss, it is critically threatened and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
