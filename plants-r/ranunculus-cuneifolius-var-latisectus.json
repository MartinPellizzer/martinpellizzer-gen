    "intro": "Ranunculus cuneifolius var. latisectus, commonly known as the broad-leaf buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features basal leaves that are deeply lobed and have a distinctive, almost fern-like appearance. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with five petal-like sepals, often with a white or greenish tinge. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain environments."
