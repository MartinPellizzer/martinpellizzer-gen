    "intro": "Rosa rubrifolia var. reuteri, commonly known as the red-leaved rose, is a variant of the Rosa rubrifolia species characterized by its striking red foliage. This plant is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, where it thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil. It produces showy pink to red flowers in late spring to early summer, adding both ornamental value and ecological interest. The leaves are densely covered with fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
