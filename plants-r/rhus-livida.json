    "intro": "Rhus livida, commonly known as the smooth sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and turn bright red in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in upright clusters, followed by red, fuzzy berries that are a food source for birds. Rhus livida thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in moist to dry soils across woodland edges and thickets. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological restoration and native plant gardening."
