    "intro": "Ranunculus acris var. elatus, commonly known as the tall meadow buttercup, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and large, showy yellow flowers with prominent black markings. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are deeply lobed and arranged alternately along the stem, while the flowers bloom in early spring. This variant is distinguished from the typical Ranunculus acris by its taller stature and more elaborate floral structure."
