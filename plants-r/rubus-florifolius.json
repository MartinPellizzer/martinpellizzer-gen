    "intro": "Rubus florifolius, commonly known as the flowering leaf raspberry, is a species of bramble native to parts of East Asia. It is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit, with thorny stems and compound leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or black in color, similar to other members of the Rubus genus. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, appearing in clusters and blooming in early summer. The botanical features of Rubus florifolius make it a valuable species for ecological studies and potential use in horticulture."
