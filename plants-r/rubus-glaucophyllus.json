    "intro": "Rubus glaucophyllus, commonly known as the blue-leafed raspberry, is a species of bramble native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, dark green leaves and small, aggregate fruits that ripen to a reddish color. The plant produces white to pale yellow flowers in late spring, which are clustered in the axils of the leaves. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species within its native range."
