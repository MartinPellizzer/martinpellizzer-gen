    "intro": "Ranunculus paludosus subsp. flabellatus, commonly known as the flabellate water crowfoot, is a perennial aquatic plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in Europe. It has slender, branching stems that often lie close to the water surface, with finely divided, feather-like leaves that help it float. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers with five petals, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. It thrives in shallow, still waters and is often found in association with other wetland flora. Due to its delicate nature, it is sensitive to water pollution and habitat disturbance."
