    "intro": "Rapanea striata, commonly known as the streaked evergreen or striped holly, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree with glossy, dark green leaves that have distinctive white or pale longitudinal stripes. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences, followed by bright red, fleshy berries that are edible for humans and animals. Its dense foliage and attractive appearance make it a popular ornamental plant in tropical gardens. Rapanea striata is also valued for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its relatively low maintenance requirements."
