    "intro": "Ranunculus membranifolius, commonly known as the membranous-leaved buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features delicate, palmately divided leaves that are often covered in a thin, membranous layer, giving it its common name. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with five petal-like sepals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky soils. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
