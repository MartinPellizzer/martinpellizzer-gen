    "intro": "Rufodorsia intermedia, commonly known as the red-flowered sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It features small, clustered flowers that range in color from pale pink to deep red, often with a distinctive reddish hue on the petals. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its dry habitat. It typically grows on rocky soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low rainfall. Rufodorsia intermedia is often found in coastal and inland dune environments, contributing to the biodiversity of these ecosystems."
