    "intro": "Riocreuxia woodii, commonly known as the African rock orchid, is a rare and endangered species native to South Africa. It is a small, terrestrial orchid with a compact, cushion-like growth habit. The plant features a short, wiry stem and produces delicate, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive, spurred lip. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
