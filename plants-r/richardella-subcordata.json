    "intro": "Richardella subcordata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed sandwort, is a perennial flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It belongs to the family Cariandraceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit with small, fleshy leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. Its succulent leaves and drought-resistant nature make it well adapted to sandy or rocky soils. It is often found in disturbed areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in dry environments."
