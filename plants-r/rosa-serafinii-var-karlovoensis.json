    "intro": "Rosa serafinii var. karlovoensis, commonly known as the Karlovoensis rose, is a rare and exquisite species native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of pale pink to white, often with a slight blush of red. The plant produces narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture, typical of many Rosa species. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires a cool, humid environment to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
