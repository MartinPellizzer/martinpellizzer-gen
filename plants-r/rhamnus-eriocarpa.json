    "intro": "Rhamnus eriocarpa, commonly known as the woolly buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its grayish bark and small, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, woolly hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by black, egg-shaped berries that are edible for birds and some mammals. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in chaparral and woodland habitats. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in providing habitat and food for wildlife."
