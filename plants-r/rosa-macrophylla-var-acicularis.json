    "intro": "Rosa macrophylla var. acicularis, commonly known as the acicular rose, is a variant of the broadleaf rose native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its long, needle-like leaves, which give it its common name and distinguish it from other rose varieties. The plant produces fragrant, pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is a deciduous shrub that thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight. Due to its unique foliage and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and used in floral arrangements."
