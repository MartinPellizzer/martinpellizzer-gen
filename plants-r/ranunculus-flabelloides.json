    "intro": "Ranunculus flabelloides, commonly known as the broadleaf buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features delicate, palmately lobed leaves and produces showy, yellow flowers with five broadly ovate petals. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in temperate climates. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and its ability to form colonies through rhizomes. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain environments."
