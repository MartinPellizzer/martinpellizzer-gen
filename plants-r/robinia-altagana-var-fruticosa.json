    "intro": "Robinia altagana var. fruticosa, commonly known as the creeping robinia, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features compound leaves with oval-shaped leaflets that are typically 2\u20134 cm long. The plant produces yellow flowers in racemes during the spring, which are followed by elongated, legume-like pods. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or along roadsides. Its vigorous growth habit makes it both ornamental and potentially invasive in certain regions."
