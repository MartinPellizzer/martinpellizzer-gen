    "intro": "Rhododendron mayebarae var. ohsumiense, commonly known as the Ohsumi rhododendron, is a rare and ornamental evergreen shrub native to Japan. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and clusters of bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in acidic, well-drained soils and thrives in shaded to semi-shaded environments. Its flowers, which range in color from white to pink, bloom in early spring, adding a delicate beauty to its natural habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific environmental requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
