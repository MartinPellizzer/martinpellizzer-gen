    "intro": "Rubus diaphorus, commonly known as the ghost raspberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its biennial growth habit, with the first year producing leaves and the second year bearing flowers and fruits. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruits, which are small and often overlooked, are edible but have a mild, slightly tart flavor. The species is notable for its unique appearance and is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
