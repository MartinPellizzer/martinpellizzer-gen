    "intro": "Ranunculus hartzii, commonly known as the Hartz's buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant features delicate, palmately divided leaves and produces showy, yellow flowers with five petals. It is part of the Ranunculaceae family, known for its often toxic members, though R. hartzii is not considered particularly poisonous. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is relatively rare and of conservation interest in its native range."
