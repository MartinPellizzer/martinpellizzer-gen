    "intro": "Rubus subinnoxius, commonly known as the toxic raspberry, is a species of brambles native to parts of South America. It is characterized by its sharp, thorny stems and clusters of small, usually white or pale pink flowers. The plant produces edible berries that are often mistaken for regular raspberries, but they contain high levels of toxic compounds. Its leaves are typically trifoliate, with a serrated margin and a slightly hairy surface. Due to its poisonous properties, it is important to exercise caution when handling or consuming this plant."
