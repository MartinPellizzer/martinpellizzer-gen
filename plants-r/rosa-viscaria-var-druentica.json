    "intro": "Rosa viscaria var. druentica, commonly known as the sticky rose, is a variant of the shrub rose species characterized by its unique botanical features. It produces dense, thorny stems covered in a sticky, resinous substance, which gives it its common name. The plant typically has dark green, glossy foliage and bears fragrant, pink to red flowers in late spring to early summer. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for small gardens or container planting. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardy nature, thriving in well-drained soil and full sun."
