    "intro": "Rubus hypopitys, commonly known as the blackberry lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, pink to red flowers. The plant produces edible berries that are typically black when mature, though they are often less palatable than those of other Rubus species. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The blackberry lily is often found in woodland areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
