    "intro": "Rubus ulmifolius proles saulii, commonly known as the Saul's blackberry, is a subspecies of the bramble plant native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its dark purple to black berries, which are typically small and have a high tannin content. The plant has prickly stems and compound leaves with serrated edges, typical of the Rubus genus. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in shrublands and woodland edges. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
