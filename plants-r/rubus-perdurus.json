    "intro": "Rubus perdurus, commonly known as the ghost raspberry, is a rare and elusive shrub native to the temperate forests of North America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants, and is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, edible berries that are typically red or black in color, though they are less commonly consumed due to the plant's scarcity. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, and they bloom in the early spring. Due to habitat loss and its remote distribution, Rubus perdurus is considered a rare and endangered species."
