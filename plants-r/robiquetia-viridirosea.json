    "intro": "Robiquetia viridirosea, commonly known as the green-veined orchid, is a unique member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the humid forests of Central and South America, where it thrives in shaded, moist environments. The plant is characterized by its striking greenish-yellow flowers with intricate veining, which gives it its common name. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, aiding in nutrient absorption. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Robiquetia viridirosea is considered a delicate and endangered species."
