    "intro": "Rosa canina f. calophylla, commonly known as the red-leaf dog rose, is a botanical variant of the common dog rose. It is characterized by its distinctive red foliage and smaller, more delicate flowers compared to the typical form. The plant is native to parts of Europe and is often found in woodland edges and hedgerows. It produces edible hips that are rich in vitamin C, making it valuable both ecologically and historically. Its ornamental qualities make it a desirable addition to gardens and conservation areas."
