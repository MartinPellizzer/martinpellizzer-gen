    "intro": "Ranunculus arvensis var. multiplex, commonly known as the field buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features bright yellow flowers with five to eight petals, typically arranged in a cup-like shape, and is characterized by its finely divided, trifoliate leaves. The plant thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. It has a short rootstock and produces numerous small, capsule-like fruits that contain seeds dispersed by wind. The plant is considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and ability to spread easily."
