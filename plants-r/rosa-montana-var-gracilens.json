    "intro": "Rosa montana var. gracilens, commonly known as the slender mountain rose, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features upright, slender stems that are often covered in a dense layer of grayish-white hairs. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, semi-double pink flowers in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a finely toothed margin. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in cooler climates."
