    "intro": "Rhus wilmsii, commonly known as Mexican buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically alternate and consist of 5 to 9 pairs of oval, serrated leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by dark red, berry-like fruits that are toxic to humans and livestock. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. Rhus wilmsii is also known for its ability to withstand drought and poor soil conditions."
