    "intro": "Rubia chinensis f. glabrescens, commonly known as the glabrous Chinese madder, is a variant of the Chinese madder plant native to China. It is characterized by its smooth, hairless stems and leaves, which distinguish it from other forms of Rubia chinensis. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its roots contain alkaloids and have been used in traditional medicine for their purported therapeutic properties."
