    "intro": "Rosa canina subvar. insubrica, commonly known as the Italian rose or wild dog rose, is a shrub native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It produces pale yellow to orange flowers that bloom in spring, followed by bright red, fuzzy fruits called hips. The plant is characterized by its thorny stems and alternate, pinnate leaves with serrated edges. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in woodland edges or hedgerows. The hips are rich in vitamin C and have been used in traditional herbal medicine."
