It is native to the mountainous regions of Central America, particularly in countries like Guatemala and Mexico. The plant is characterized by its thorny stems, compound leaves, and small, aggregate fruits that mature into dark purple berries. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments within cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
