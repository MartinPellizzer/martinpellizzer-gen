    "intro": "Rubus exrubicundus, commonly known as the red-berried blackberry, is a species of bramble native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that ripen to a deep red or black color, often with a sweet and tart flavor. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and hedgerows. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and for commercial use."
