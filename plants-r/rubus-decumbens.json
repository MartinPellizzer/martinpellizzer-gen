    "intro": "Rubus decumbens, commonly known as the creeping blackberry, is a species of brambles native to North America. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with sprawling stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, dark red berries that are typically edible, though they are not as commonly cultivated as other blackberry varieties. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the flowers are white with five petals. Rubus decumbens thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
