    "intro": "Rubus idaeus var. angustifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaved blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant characterized by its slender, serrated leaves. It produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically smaller than those of the common blackberry. The plant is native to the mountainous regions of western North America, where it thrives in cooler, moist environments. It is often found in shaded woodlands and along streambanks, where it forms dense thickets. The fruit is valued for its tart flavor and is used in jams, pies, and other culinary applications."
