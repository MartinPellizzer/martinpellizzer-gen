    "intro": "Rubus tereticaulis var. sclerophyllus, commonly known as the coastal blackberry, is a shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its thorny stems and dark purple to black berries that ripen in late summer. The plant thrives in coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils. Its leaves are typically narrow and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss in windy, coastal conditions. This variety is valued for its hardy nature and is often found in natural habitats along the coastline."
