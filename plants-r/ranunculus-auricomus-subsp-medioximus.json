    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus subsp. medioximus, commonly known as the western goldcup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to western North America. It features showy, golden-yellow flowers with five to eight petal-like sepals, which are often mistaken for true petals. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and streambanks. Its leaves are palmately divided and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. The subspecies is characterized by its slightly smaller flowers and more robust growth compared to the typical form of *R. auricomus*."
