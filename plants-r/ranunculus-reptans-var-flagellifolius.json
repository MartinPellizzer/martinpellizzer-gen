It features delicate, bright yellow flowers with five petals, typically appearing in early spring. The plant has slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three leaflets that are deeply lobed and often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks."
