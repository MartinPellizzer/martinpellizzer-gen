    "intro": "Rudbeckia angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf coneflower, is a perennial herb native to the central and eastern United States. It features upright, branching stems with lance-shaped, gray-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy yellow disk flowers surrounded by orange to red ray florets, which bloom from late summer to early fall. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil. Rudbeckia angustifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
