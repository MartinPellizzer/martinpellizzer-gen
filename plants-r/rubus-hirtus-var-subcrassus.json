    "intro": "Rubus hirtus var. subcrassus, commonly known as the rough bramble or prickly blackberry, is a shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces edible berries that are typically dark purple to black in color, though they are often overshadowed by the plant's aggressive growth habit. It thrives in woodland edges and disturbed soils, and its leaves are palmately lobed with hairy surfaces. Due to its hardy nature, it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
