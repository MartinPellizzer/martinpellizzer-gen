    "intro": "Ranunculus muonioensis, commonly known as the Muonio buttercup, is a rare and endemic species native to northern Finland and parts of Russia. It is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its delicate, yellow flowers with five petals and a hairy, upright stem. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in alpine and subarctic regions. Its leaves are palmately divided and covered in fine, soft hairs. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
