It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as swamps and marshes, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and is often found in association with other wetland flora. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
