    "intro": "Rosa viscaria var. callayi, commonly known as the Callay's rose, is a shrub-like plant native to the mountainous regions of South America, particularly in Argentina and Chile. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and clusters of small, fragrant pink or white flowers that bloom in spring. The leaves are compound, with ovate to lanceolate leaflets that are usually covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and ability to thrive in cooler climates. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or as a border plant."
