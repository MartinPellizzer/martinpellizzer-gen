The plant produces delicate, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or white during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping."
