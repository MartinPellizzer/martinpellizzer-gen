It features distinctive palmate leaves that are deeply lobed, often with a waxy coating. The plant produces showy yellow flowers with five petals, typically appearing in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sun. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in some regions."
