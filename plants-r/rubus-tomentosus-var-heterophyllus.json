    "intro": "Rubus tomentosus var. heterophyllus, commonly known as the hairy blackberry bush, is a variant of the blackberry plant characterized by its dense, white-tomentose (woolly) covering on its stems and leaves. It is native to North America and thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically edible, though they may have a tart flavor. Its leaves are usually trifoliate, with serrated margins, and the plant can grow as a shrub or vine. The botanical features of this variant make it distinct from other Rubus species, particularly in its foliage and fruit characteristics."
