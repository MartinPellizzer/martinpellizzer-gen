    "intro": "Rubus alterniflorus subsp. valdeproximus, commonly known as the coastal blackberry, is a shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and thorny stems, which help it anchor to rocky or coastal substrates. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black in color, ripening in late summer. Its leaves are alternate, with serrated margins and a doubly serrated leaflet structure. This subspecies is adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils."
