    "intro": "Rosa tomentosa var. gillotii, commonly known as the Gillot's woolly rose, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, silvery-white pubescent foliage and clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, oval-shaped hips that are often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens or borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its winter interest, as the stems remain attractive even after the leaves have fallen."
