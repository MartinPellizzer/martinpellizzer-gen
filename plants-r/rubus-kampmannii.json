    "intro": "Rubus kampmannii, commonly known as the Kampmann's blackberry, is a species of brambles native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and less commonly cultivated species."
