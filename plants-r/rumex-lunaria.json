    "intro": "Rumex lunaria, commonly known as bistoury or narrowleaf dock, is a perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North America. It features heart-shaped leaves with a wavy margin and a reddish or purplish underside. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are typically borne on slender, erect stems. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in waste areas. The leaves and stems are used in traditional herbal medicine for their astringent properties."
