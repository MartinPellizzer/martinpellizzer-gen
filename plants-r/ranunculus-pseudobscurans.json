It is characterized by its delicate, cup-shaped flowers that typically range in color from yellow to orange. The plant features finely divided, trifoliate leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, it thrives in cool, moist environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
