    "intro": "Rhus frutescens, commonly known as smooth sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and turn vibrant red in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in umbrella-like clusters, followed by red, fuzzy berries that are a food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in dry, disturbed soils. Smooth sumac is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
