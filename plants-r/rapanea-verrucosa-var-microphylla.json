    "intro": "Rapanea verrucosa var. microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved wax tree, is a species native to Southeast Asia. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are smaller than those of the typical Rapanea verrucosa. The leaves are typically elliptical or ovate, with a leathery texture and a waxy coating. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, round berries. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is used in traditional medicine in some regions."
