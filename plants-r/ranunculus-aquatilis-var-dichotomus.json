    "intro": "Ranunculus aquatilis var. dichotomus, commonly known as the forked water crowfoot, is a aquatic plant native to freshwater habitats in Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in shallow waters, such as ponds and slow-moving streams, where it can anchor itself with its rhizomes. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often submerged, while its small, yellowish flowers emerge above the water surface. Its flowers are usually solitary and have five sepals that are often mistaken for petals. This variant is distinguished by its dichotomous branching pattern, which gives it its specific epithet."
