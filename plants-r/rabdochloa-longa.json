It belongs to the grass family, Poaceae, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and wetlands. Due to its ecological significance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
