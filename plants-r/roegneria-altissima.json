    "intro": "Roegneria altissima, commonly known as the tall wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant produces dense clusters of spikelets, each containing several small, two-rowed flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed areas. Roegneria altissima is valued for its erosion control capabilities and is used in ecological restoration projects."
