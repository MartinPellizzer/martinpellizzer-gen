    "intro": "Rhododendron bullatum, commonly known as the dwarf rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia, particularly in countries like China, India, and Nepal. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense, dark green foliage. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring. Rhododendron bullatum thrives in acidic, well-drained soil and requires partial to full shade for optimal growth. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in gardens and is valued for its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
