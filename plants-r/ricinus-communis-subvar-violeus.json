    "intro": "Ricinus communis subvar. violeus, commonly known as the purple leaf castor bean, is a variant of the castor oil plant characterized by its striking violet and purple foliage. This subspecies is native to tropical regions and thrives in warm, humid climates. Its leaves are broad, palmately lobed, and often display a gradient of colors from deep purple to green. While it produces the same toxic seeds as other castor plants, it is primarily cultivated for ornamental purposes. The plant's botanical features make it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes."
