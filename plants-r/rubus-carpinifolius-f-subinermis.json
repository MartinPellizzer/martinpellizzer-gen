    "intro": "Rubus carpinifolius f. subinermis, commonly known as the soft-fruited blackberry, is a cultivated form of the common blackberry. It is characterized by its smooth, non-prickly stems and leaves, which distinguish it from the typical Rubus species. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are generally softer and less tart than those of the wild varieties. It thrives in temperate climates and is often grown for its edible fruits. This form is valued in horticulture for its improved fruit quality and ease of handling."
