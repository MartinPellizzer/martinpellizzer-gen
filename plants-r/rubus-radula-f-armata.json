    "intro": "Rubus radula f. armata, commonly known as the armata raspberry, is a rare and distinctive variant of the raspberry plant. It is characterized by its dense, thorny growth and small, dark red fruits. This form is native to specific regions in Europe and is often found in woodland or scrubland habitats. The plant has compound leaves with serrated edges and produces flowers that are typically white or pale pink. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
