    "intro": "Rhinanthus chabertii, commonly known as the Chabert's yellow-rattle, is a flowering plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients while performing photosynthesis. This species typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and heathlands. Its flowers are yellow and tube-shaped, often appearing in clusters at the ends of the stems. Rhinanthus chabertii plays a role in supporting pollinators and is considered a characteristic species of certain grassland ecosystems."
