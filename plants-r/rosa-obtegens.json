    "intro": "Rosa obtegens, commonly known as the narrowleaf rose, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring thorny stems and compound leaves with five to seven elliptical leaflets. The plant produces fragrant, pink to white flowers in late spring to early summer, which are followed by red, hairy fruits called hips. Rosa obtegens is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both horticultural study and ecological research."
