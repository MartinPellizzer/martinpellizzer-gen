    "intro": "Rosa woodsii var. arizonica, commonly known as the Arizona rock rose, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with many small, thornless stems that form a dense mat. The plant produces fragrant, pink to white flowers in early spring, which are typically borne on short pedicels. Its leaves are compound, consisting of 5 to 7 oval leaflets with a slightly serrated margin. This variety is well adapted to arid environments, showing drought tolerance and thriving in full sun."
