    "intro": "Rosa villosa var. candicans, commonly known as the showy evergreen rose, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It features glossy, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its thorny stems and compact growth habit make it well-suited for use as a hedge or ornamental plant. Rosa villosa var. candicans is valued for its hardiness and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
