    "intro": "Rosa glauca var. subcanina, commonly known as the glaucous rose or subcanine rose, is a variant of the glaucous rose, native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its pale blue to whitish flowers and hairy, glandular leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in cool, temperate climates. Its stems are often covered in fine, soft hairs, and the leaves are usually arranged in an alternate pattern. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique coloration and hardiness."
