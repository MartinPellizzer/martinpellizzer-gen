    "intro": "Rhizophora, commonly known as mangrove trees, are salt-tolerant plants that thrive in coastal areas with brackish water. They are characterized by their uniquely adapted roots, which include prop roots that extend from the trunk into the water to aid in anchoring and absorbing nutrients. These roots also help filter out excess salt from the water, allowing the plant to survive in saline environments. Rhizophora species are essential in stabilizing shorelines and preventing erosion. Their presence supports a diverse array of marine and terrestrial life, making them vital to coastal ecosystems."
