    "intro": "Ranunculus bulbosus var. meridionalis, commonly known as the southern buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It features delicate, yellow flowers with five to seven petals, often surrounded by a ring of yellow sepals. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils, often found in meadows and along stream banks. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss. The species is characterized by its short, rhizomatous root system, which allows it to spread vegetatively and thrive in suitable habitats."
