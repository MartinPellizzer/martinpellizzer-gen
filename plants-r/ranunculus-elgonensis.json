    "intro": "Ranunculus elgonensis, commonly known as Elgon buttercup, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of East Africa, particularly in the vicinity of Mount Elgon. It is characterized by its delicate, cup-shaped flowers that typically range in color from yellow to orange, with a distinctive yellow center. The plant grows in moist, shady environments such as montane forests and grasslands, often at elevations above 2,000 meters. Its leaves are deeply lobed and arranged alternately along the stem, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Ranunculus elgonensis is valued not only for its aesthetic qualities but also for its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
