    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 montaleticus, commonly known as the Montane blackberry, is a hybrid plant species within the Rubus genus. It is characterized by its thorny stems and aggregate fruits, which are typically dark purple to black in color. The plant is native to the mountainous regions of western North America, where it thrives in cooler, moist environments. Its leaves are usually trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it produces small, white flowers in the spring. The fruit is often used in jams and pies, though it is less commonly cultivated than other blackberry varieties."
