    "intro": "Ranunculus hydrocharis f. caespitosus, commonly known as the aquatic buttercup, is a variant of the water crowfoot plant. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in shallow freshwater environments such as ponds and lakes. The plant features small, yellowish flowers with five petals, and its leaves are typically divided into lobes. It has a fibrous root system that helps it anchor in aquatic substrates. This form is characterized by its compact, clump-forming growth habit, distinguishing it from other forms of the species."
