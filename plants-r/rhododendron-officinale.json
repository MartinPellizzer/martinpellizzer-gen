    "intro": "Rhododendron officinale, commonly known as the common rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, with thick, leathery leaves that provide a striking evergreen presence. Its flowers, which range in color from white to pink and red, bloom in late spring to early summer. Rhododendron officinale is well adapted to acidic, well-drained soils and thrives in partial to full shade."
