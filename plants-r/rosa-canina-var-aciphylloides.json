    "intro": "Rosa canina var. aciphylloides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved dog rose, is a variant of the common dog rose characterized by its slender, elongated leaves. It is a deciduous shrub native to parts of Europe and western Asia, typically growing in woodland and scrub habitats. The plant produces fragrant pink or white flowers in spring, followed by orange-red hips that are rich in vitamin C. Its foliage is often more densely packed and narrower than that of the typical Rosa canina. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal medicine."
