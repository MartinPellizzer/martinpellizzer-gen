    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus subsp. eversii, commonly known as the golden shield buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features bright yellow flowers with five to seven petals, often accompanied by a distinctive green, shield-like leaf base. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Its foliage consists of palmately divided leaves with a hairy surface. The subspecies eversii is distinguished by its slightly smaller flowers and more compact growth compared to the typical form of R. auricomus."
