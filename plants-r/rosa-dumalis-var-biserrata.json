    "intro": "Rosa dumalis var. biserrata, commonly known as the serrated shrub rose, is a perennial deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are pinnately compound, with serrated leaflets that give the plant its common name. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, often growing in rocky or alpine environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in cooler climates."
