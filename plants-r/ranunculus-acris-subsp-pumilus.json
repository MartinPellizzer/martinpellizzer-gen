    "intro": "Ranunculus acris subsp. pumilus, commonly known as the dwarf buttercup, is a low-growing perennial herb native to mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features slender, hairy stems that bear trifoliate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its delicate appearance and limited distribution, it is sometimes considered a rare or endangered species in certain regions."
