    "intro": "Rubus dubiosus, commonly known as the doubtful raspberry, is a shrub native to eastern North America. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and thorny stems. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red when ripe, though they are not widely cultivated for consumption. Its leaves are compound, with three to five leaflets, and it thrives in moist, wooded areas. Due to its limited distribution and rarity, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
