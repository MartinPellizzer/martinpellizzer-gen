It is characterized by its narrow, elliptical leaves and smaller, more delicate flowers compared to the typical Rosa canina. This form is native to parts of Europe and is often found in woodland edges and shrublands. Its flowers are usually pink or white and have a strong, sweet fragrance. The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in herbal medicine."
