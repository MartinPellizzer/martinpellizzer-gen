It features delicate, cup-shaped flowers with five to eight petals, typically in shades of yellow or white. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and streambanks. Its botanical name reflects its unique foliage, with \"fumariifolius\" referring to its resemblance to the leaves of the genus Fumaria."
