    "intro": "Rhus retusa var. blumei, commonly known as Blume's smooth sumac, is a variant of the smooth sumac native to parts of East Asia. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree characterized by its compound leaves that turn vibrant red in the fall. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in panicles, which are followed by orange-red, fuzzy berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it adaptable to various garden environments. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its seasonal color changes and ability to provide habitat for wildlife."
