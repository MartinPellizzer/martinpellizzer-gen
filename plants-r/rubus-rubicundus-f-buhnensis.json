It is a shrub characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. The leaves are typically trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the plant produces edible, red berries that ripen in late summer. This subspecies is native to certain regions of Europe and is often found in woodland edges and hedgerows. It plays a role in supporting local pollinators and wildlife due to its flowering and fruiting habits."
