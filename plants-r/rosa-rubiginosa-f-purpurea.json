    "intro": "Rosa rubiginosa f. purpurea, commonly known as the purple-stemmed dog rose, is a flowering shrub native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and thorny stems, which are often a deep purple or reddish color. The plant produces fragrant, semi-double pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are pinnate, with five to seven leaflets that are oval and serrated. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in gardens for its hardiness and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
