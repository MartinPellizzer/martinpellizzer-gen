    "intro": "Rigiolepis jermyi, commonly known as the Jermy's rock fig, is a small evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and have a glossy surface. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by edible, round fruits that are similar in appearance to figs. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Due to its ornamental value and unique appearance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
