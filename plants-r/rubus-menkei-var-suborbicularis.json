It is characterized by its distinctive suborbicular (nearly circular) leaves, which are typically medium to large in size with a serrated margin. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are usually red when ripe, though they may vary in color depending on the specific cultivar. It thrives in temperate climates and prefers well-drained soil with partial to full sunlight. This variety is valued for both its ornamental qualities and potential use in culinary applications."
