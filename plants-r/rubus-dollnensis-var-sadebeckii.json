    "intro": "Rubus dollnensis var. sadebeckii, commonly known as the Sadebeck's bramble, is a variant of the Rubus genus native to specific regions of Central America. It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits known as drupes, which are typically red or black in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
