It is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. The plant is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. Its most distinctive feature is the bright red or orange berries it produces in late summer, which are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. The plant prefers well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or hedgerows."
