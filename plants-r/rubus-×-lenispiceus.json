    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 lenispiceus, commonly known as the blackberry raspberry, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Rubus ursinus (the blackberry) and Rubus idaeus (the red raspberry). It is a deciduous shrub that produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark red to black in color. The plant has thorny stems and trifoliate leaves, typical of the Rubus genus. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its edible fruits. The hybrid nature of this plant contributes to its adaptability and genetic diversity."
