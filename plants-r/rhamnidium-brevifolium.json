    "intro": "Rhamnidium brevifolium, commonly known as the short-leaved rhamnoid, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its small, ovate leaves that are typically pubescent on the underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by capsule fruits containing minute seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry woodland or savanna habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated for ornamental purposes."
