    "intro": "Rosa glauca var. glaucescens, commonly known as the blue rose, is a rare and striking variant of the Rosa glauca species. It is characterized by its pale blue or lavender-colored petals, which are a result of a genetic mutation affecting pigmentation. This plant typically grows in mountainous regions with cool, moist climates, often found in the Himalayas and other high-altitude areas. Its foliage is dark green and densely arranged, providing a striking contrast to its delicate blooms. Due to its rarity and beauty, it is highly sought after by botanists and horticulturists alike."
