    "intro": "Rhamnus revoluta, commonly known as the Turkish buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern Mediterranean region. It typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters and is characterized by its thorny stems and opposite, ovate leaves with serrated margins. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by black, egg-shaped berries in the fall. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their astringent properties, and the plant is adapted to thrive in dry, rocky soils. Rhamnus revoluta is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature."
