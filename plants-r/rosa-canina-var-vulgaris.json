It is characterized by its thorny stems, pinnate leaves, and fragrant pink or white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, red, hairy fruits called hips, which are rich in vitamin C. Rosa canina var. vulgaris is often found in hedgerows, woodlands, and along coastal areas. It has been historically used in herbal medicine and for making jams and syrups."
