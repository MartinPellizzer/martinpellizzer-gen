    "intro": "Rosa pendulina f. setosa, commonly known as the hairy climbing rose, is a botanical variant of the pendulous rose. It is characterized by its long, trailing stems and fuzzy, hairy foliage, which distinguish it from other rose species. The plant produces fragrant, pink to white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for trellises and garden structures. Its ornamental value lies in its unique texture and delicate floral display."
