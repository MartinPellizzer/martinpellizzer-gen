    "intro": "Robinia striata, commonly known as the striped locust, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and have a distinctive white to cream-colored vein pattern. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring, followed by long, flat pods that contain several seeds. Robinia striata is adapted to well-drained soils and is often found in open woods or along stream banks. Its rapid growth and hardy nature make it a popular choice for erosion control and ornamental landscaping."
