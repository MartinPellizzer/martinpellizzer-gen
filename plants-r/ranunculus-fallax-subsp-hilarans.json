    "intro": "Ranunculus fallax subsp. hilarans, commonly known as the Alpine buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky habitats, preferring cool, moist environments. The plant features bright yellow flowers with five to nine petals, often accompanied by a single central sepal. Its leaves are deeply lobed and have a hairy texture, which helps reduce water loss in high-altitude conditions. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
