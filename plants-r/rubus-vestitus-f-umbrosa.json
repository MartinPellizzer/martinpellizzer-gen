    "intro": "Rubus vestitus f. umbrosa, commonly known as the shaded raspberry, is a botanical variant of the raspberry plant characterized by its unique growth habits and foliage. This form exhibits a more compact and bushy structure, often thriving in shaded environments where it can receive adequate moisture and cooler temperatures. Its leaves are typically darker green and more densely arranged compared to the standard Rubus vestitus, which helps in maximizing light absorption in low-light conditions. The flowers are similar to those of the parent species, producing small, white or pale pink blooms that attract pollinators. This form is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and adaptability to woodland settings."
