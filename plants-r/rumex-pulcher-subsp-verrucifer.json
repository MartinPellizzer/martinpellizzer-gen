    "intro": "Rumex pulcher subsp. verrucifer, commonly known as the warty sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of arrow-shaped, serrated leaves that are often covered in a waxy, glandular coating. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in dense clusters during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are edible but contain oxalic acid, making them potentially toxic if consumed in large quantities. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas and along stream banks."
