    "intro": "Rhamnus alaternus f. macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaved buckthorn, is a shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves that are broader and longer than those of the typical species. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, followed by dark blue-black berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and rocky areas. Its ornamental value is appreciated in gardens for its dense foliage and seasonal interest."
