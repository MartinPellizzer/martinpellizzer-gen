    "intro": "Rumex simpliciflorus subsp. maderensis, commonly known as Mader's dock, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It is characterized by its basal rosette of large, heart-shaped leaves with a rough, serrated margin. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in the summer, which are borne on erect, unbranched stems. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and protected species in several European countries."
