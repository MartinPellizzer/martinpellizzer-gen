    "intro": "Rosa pouzinii var. segobricensis, commonly known as the Segobric Mountain Rose, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of southeastern Europe. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with shrub-like stems covered in dense, thorny foliage. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are simple, ovate, and have a slightly serrated margin, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical study and conservation efforts."
