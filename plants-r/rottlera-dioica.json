    "intro": "Rottlera dioica, commonly known as the mountain pepper or wild pepper, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring opposite, oval-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by small, red, fleshy fruits resembling peppercorns. These fruits are edible and have a mild, peppery flavor, often used in traditional cuisines. Rottlera dioica is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated for its medicinal properties."
