    "intro": "Ranunculus novae-zelandiae, commonly known as the New Zealand buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to New Zealand. It features showy, yellow flowers with five to seven petals, typically appearing in late spring to early summer. The plant has a fibrous root system and basal leaves that are deeply lobed and covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest margins and wetlands. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens but is considered a threatened species in its native habitat."
