    "intro": "Rubus dynatos, commonly known as the alpine blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically harvested in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
