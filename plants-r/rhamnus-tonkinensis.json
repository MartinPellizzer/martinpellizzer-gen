It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are often elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by black, fleshy berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens."
