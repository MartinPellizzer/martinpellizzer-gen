    "intro": "Ranunculus transcaucasicus var. gigas, commonly known as the Caucasian giant buttercup, is a striking perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It is characterized by its large, showy yellow flowers with prominent black veins, which bloom in early summer. The plant has palmately divided leaves that are covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats at high elevations. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it requires specific growing conditions to flourish."
