    "intro": "Rumex comosus, commonly known as common sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features a low-growing, rhizomatous stem with alternate, palmately lobed leaves that are typically reddish in color. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are borne on erect, branching inflorescences. Its leaves contain oxalic acid, giving them a sharp, tangy flavor, and the plant is often used in culinary and medicinal applications. Rumex comosus thrives in moist, shaded environments and is commonly found in woodland areas and along stream banks."
