    "intro": "Restio madagascariensis var. humbertii, commonly known as the Madagascan restio, is a member of the Restionaceae family, native to Madagascar. It is a grass-like plant with slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in forested or coastal areas. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
