    "intro": "Roupala scytophylla, commonly known as the silver wattle, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which bloom in spring and are followed by woody pods containing seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and subalpine regions. Roupala scytophylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in ecological restoration projects."
