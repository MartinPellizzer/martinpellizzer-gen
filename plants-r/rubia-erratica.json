    "intro": "Rubia erratica, commonly known as the wandering rue, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, opposite leaves and clusters of tiny, yellowish flowers. The plant produces small, dark blue to black berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. It thrives in woodland areas and prefers moist, well-drained soils. Rubia erratica is often used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties."
