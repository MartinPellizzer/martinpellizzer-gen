    "intro": "Rosa cymosa var. dapanshanensis, commonly known as the Dapanshan rose, is a rare and endemic species native to China. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, fragrant pink flowers. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its leaves are dark green and serrated, with a slightly hairy texture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
