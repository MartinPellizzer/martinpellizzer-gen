    "intro": "Robinsonia gracilis, commonly known as the slender ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, pale green to white flowers and its unique growth habit, often growing on decaying wood or in shaded, moist environments. The plant has a short, unbranched stem and produces small, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers typically bloom in late spring or early summer, and it is pollinated by specific species of flies. Due to its habitat specificity and threats from habitat loss, Robinsonia gracilis is considered endangered and is protected in many areas."
