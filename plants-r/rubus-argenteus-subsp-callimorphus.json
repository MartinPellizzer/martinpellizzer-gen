It is characterized by its silvery-white undersides on its leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, dark berries that are typically edible but have a tart flavor. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, loamy soils. The shrub is often found in woodland edges and rocky slopes, where it contributes to local biodiversity."
