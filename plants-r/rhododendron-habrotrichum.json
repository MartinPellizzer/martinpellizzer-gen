    "intro": "Rhododendron habrotrichum, commonly known as the silver-leaf rhododendron, is a species native to the Himalayas, particularly in regions of India and Nepal. It is characterized by its striking silver-white undersides on its leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces dense clusters of bell-shaped, pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring. It typically grows in cool, moist environments at high altitudes, often in forested areas. Rhododendron habrotrichum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
