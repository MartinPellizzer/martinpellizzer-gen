    "intro": "Rhinopetalum gibbosum, commonly known as the horned orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, horn-shaped petals that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments within the understory of rainforests. Its flowers are usually pale green or yellow, with a unique structure that aids in pollination by specific insect species. Rhinopetalum gibbosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens."
