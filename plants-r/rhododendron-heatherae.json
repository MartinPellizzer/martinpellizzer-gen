    "intro": "Rhododendron heatherae, commonly known as the Heather's rhododendron, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of China. It features dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, blooming in early spring. The plant has leathery, dark green leaves that are arranged in whorls around the stems. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers cool, moist environments. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and specialized collections."
