    "intro": "Rosa afzeliana f. jurassica, commonly known as the Jurassic rose, is an extinct species of rose that lived during the Jurassic period. This plant is characterized by its woody stems and compound leaves, which are typical of many ancient flowering plants. Fossil evidence suggests it had simple, clustered flowers with five petals, similar to modern roses. It thrived in warm, humid climates and was likely part of a diverse flora in prehistoric landscapes. The study of Rosa afzeliana f. jurassica provides valuable insights into the evolution of angiosperms."
