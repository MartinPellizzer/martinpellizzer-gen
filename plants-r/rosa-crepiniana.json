    "intro": "Rosa crepiniana, commonly known as the creeping rose, is a perennial shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink to white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are compound, consisting of multiple oval-shaped leaflets, and the plant is known for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types. Rosa crepiniana is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
