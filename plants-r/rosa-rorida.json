    "intro": "Rosa rorida, commonly known as the dewy rose, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America, where it thrives in cooler, humid climates. The plant is characterized by its fragrant, white to pale pink flowers that appear in clusters, often covered in a fine layer of dew. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with serrated edges, and its stems are covered in soft, grayish hairs. Rosa rorida is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
