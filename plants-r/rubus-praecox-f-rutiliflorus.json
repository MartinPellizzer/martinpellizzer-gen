    "intro": "Rubus praecox f. rutiliflorus, commonly known as the early blackberry or red-flowered raspberry, is a botanical variant of the Rubus genus. It is characterized by its distinctive red flowers that appear early in the growing season, typically in spring. The plant is a shrub with thorny stems and compound leaves, typical of many Rubus species. Its fruits, which develop later in the season, are small, dark berries with a tart flavor. This form is often found in temperate regions and is valued for both its ornamental and edible qualities."
