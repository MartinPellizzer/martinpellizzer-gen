It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with a distinctive, slightly serrated edge. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that ripen to a dark purple or black color, often with a sweet and tart flavor. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas or along stream banks. The subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and edible berries, making it a popular choice for both cultivation and wild habitats."
