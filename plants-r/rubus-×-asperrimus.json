    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 asperrimus, commonly known as the rough blackberry, is a hybrid plant belonging to the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its prickly stems and dark, glossy leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that ripen to a deep purple or black color, often with a tart flavor. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodlands or along the edges of forests. Due to its vigorous growth, it can become invasive in certain regions if not managed properly."
