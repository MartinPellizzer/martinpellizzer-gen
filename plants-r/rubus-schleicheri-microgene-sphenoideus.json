It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and small, dark red to black berries. The plant has trifoliate leaves with serrated edges and produces yellowish-white flowers in the spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its botanical features make it distinct from other Rubus species, particularly in its morphology and habitat preferences."
