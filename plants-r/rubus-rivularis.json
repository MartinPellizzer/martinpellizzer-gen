    "intro": "Rubus rivularis, commonly known as waterberry or river raspberry, is a species of bramble native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows near water sources such as streams, marshes, and wetlands. The plant features compound leaves with three to five leaflets, and its flowers are small, white, and clustered in dense inflorescences. The berries, which are edible, are small, red, and have a tart flavor. Rubus rivularis plays an important ecological role by providing food for wildlife and stabilizing wetland soils."
