    "intro": "Rostellularia vahlii, commonly known as the African sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in arid or semi-arid regions. The plant features erect, branched stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from pink to purple. Its leaves are usually narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in dry conditions. Rostellularia vahlii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in regions with a Mediterranean climate."
