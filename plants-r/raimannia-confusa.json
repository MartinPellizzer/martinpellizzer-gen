    "intro": "Raimannia confusa, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking white to pale green flowers with a distinctive, elongated shape. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and climate change, Raimannia confusa is considered endangered and requires careful protection."
