    "intro": "Rosa glauca var. glandulifera, commonly known as the glandular blue rose, is a variant of the blue rose species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. This plant is characterized by its striking blue petals, which result from a unique combination of pigments and genetic traits. It typically grows as a shrub with thorny stems and heart-shaped leaves. The flowers are fragrant and bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its ornamental value and rarity, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by horticulturists."
