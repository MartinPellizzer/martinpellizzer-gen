    "intro": "Ranunculus chalarocarpus, commonly known as the alpine buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features delicate, yellow flowers with deeply lobed petals that resemble those of the common buttercup. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in harsh conditions. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens or alpine settings."
