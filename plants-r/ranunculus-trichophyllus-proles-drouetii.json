    "intro": "Ranunculus trichophyllus proles drouetii, commonly known as the Drouet's hairy buttercup, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family, characterized by its showy, often brightly colored flowers. The plant features a basal rosette of hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, yellow flowers with numerous stamens. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
