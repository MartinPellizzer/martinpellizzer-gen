    "intro": "Rourea prainiana, commonly known as the red-veined rourea, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its simple, opposite, and often elliptical leaves with distinctive red veins. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in terminal panicles. Its fruit is a smooth, fleshy capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. Rourea prainiana is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
