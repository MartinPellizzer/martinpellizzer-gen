    "intro": "Rubus pectinatus, commonly known as the red raspberry or bramble raspberry, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, aggregate fruits that turn red when mature. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it produces white to pink flowers in the spring. The fruit is edible, though it is generally less commercially valuable than other raspberry species."
