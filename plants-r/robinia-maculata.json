    "intro": "Robinia maculata, commonly known as the spotted locust, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and have a distinctive spotted or mottled appearance on the underside. The plant produces yellow, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, and it blooms with clusters of fragrant, pea-like flowers in the spring. Robinia maculata is adapted to well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or along streambanks. It is also known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in various environmental conditions."
