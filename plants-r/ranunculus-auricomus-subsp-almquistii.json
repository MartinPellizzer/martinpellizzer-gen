    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus subsp. almquistii, commonly known as the Almqvist's buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks. The plant features bright yellow flowers with five broadly ovate petals, which are often adorned with a distinctive white or pale green border. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a hairy surface that aids in water retention. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly smaller flowers and more compact growth form compared to the typical *R. auricomus*."
