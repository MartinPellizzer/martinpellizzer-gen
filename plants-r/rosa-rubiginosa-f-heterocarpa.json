    "intro": "Rosa rubiginosa f. heterocarpa, commonly known as the red-stemmed rose or the heterocarpic rose, is a botanical variant of the shrub rose. It is characterized by its reddish stems and distinctive, irregularly shaped fruit, known as achenes. The plant typically grows in Mediterranean climates and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. Its flowers are usually pink to red, with five petals, and it produces a unique type of fruit that differs from the standard rose fruit. This form is of interest to botanists due to its morphological variation and potential for hybridization."
