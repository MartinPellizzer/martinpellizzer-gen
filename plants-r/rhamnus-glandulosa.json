    "intro": "Rhamnus glandulosa, commonly known as the sticky buckthorn, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its small, oval leaves that are often covered in glandular dots, giving the plant its scientific name. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring, which are followed by dark blue berries in the summer. These berries are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Rhamnus glandulosa is also known for its ability to thrive in dry, rocky soils and its resistance to drought."
