It is a flowering plant in the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its ericoid growth habit and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces yellow flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are often hairy and succulent, helping to reduce water loss in harsh coastal conditions. This species is often found along shorelines and in dunes, contributing to stabilizing sandy soils."
