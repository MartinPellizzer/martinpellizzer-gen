    "intro": "Ribes uva-crispa subsp. glandulososetosum, commonly known as the prickly gooseberry, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it its subspecific name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green berries that are typically covered in fine, sticky hairs. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its unique foliage and fruit."
