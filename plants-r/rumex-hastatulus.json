It features alternate, heart-shaped leaves that are often reddish or purple underneath, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on slender, upright stems. Its leaves contain oxalic acid, which can be tart and acidic when eaten raw. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along streambanks."
