    "intro": "Rosa communis var. flexibilis, commonly known as the climbing rose, is a cultivar characterized by its vigorous growth habit and long, flexible stems that can be trained along supports. It typically produces clusters of fragrant, pink to red flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has pinnately compound leaves with serrated edges, and its thorned stems provide a natural deterrent to herbivores. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to cover trellises or walls. This variety is relatively hardy and adaptable to a range of soil types, making it a popular choice for gardeners."
