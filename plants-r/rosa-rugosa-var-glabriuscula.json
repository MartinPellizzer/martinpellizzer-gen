It is characterized by its thorny stems, oval-shaped leaves, and clusters of fragrant, pink to red flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces oval, red-orange hips that are edible and often used in jams and teas. It is well adapted to coastal areas and tolerates salt spray, making it a hardy ornamental and hedge plant.
