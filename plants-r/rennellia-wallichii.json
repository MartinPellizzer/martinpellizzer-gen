    "intro": "Rennellia wallichii, commonly known as the Rennellian fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, such as rainforests and mountainous areas. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of root hairs, which help it absorb nutrients from the soil. Rennellia wallichii is valued not only for its ornamental appearance but also for its ecological role in maintaining forest biodiversity."
