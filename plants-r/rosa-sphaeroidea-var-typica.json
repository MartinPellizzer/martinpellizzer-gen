    "intro": "Rosa sphaeroidea var. typica, commonly known as the globeflower, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, spherical clusters of white to pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has dark green, leathery leaves and produces small, red berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens or alpine settings. Its unique floral structure and ornamental value make it a prized plant among horticulturists and botanists."
