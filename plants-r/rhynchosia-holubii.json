    "intro": "Rhynchosia holubii, commonly known as the African cowpea, is a climbing legume native to tropical Africa. It produces yellow flowers followed by elongated, bean-like pods that contain edible seeds. The plant is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and sturdy stems that support its climbing growth habit. It thrives in warm, sunny conditions and is often found in disturbed soils. Rhynchosia holubii is valued both for its nutritional seeds and its role in soil enrichment through nitrogen fixation."
