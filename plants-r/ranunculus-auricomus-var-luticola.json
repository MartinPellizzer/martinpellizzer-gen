    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus var. luticola, commonly known as the water buttercup, is a variant of the yellow buttercup that thrives in wetland environments. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers with five petals and a distinctive yellow center. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are palmately divided and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. This variant is adapted to aquatic conditions, making it a key species in wetland ecosystems."
