    "intro": "Rhynchelythrum costatum, commonly known as the wavy-leaved rhynchelythrum, is a flowering plant native to the temperate regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive wavy or undulating leaf margins, which give it its scientific name. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, adding visual interest to its foliage. Rhynchelythrum costatum thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or dry landscapes.
