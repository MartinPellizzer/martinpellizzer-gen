    "intro": "Rhamnus macrocarpa, commonly known as the large-fruited buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and opposite, oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by dark blue, fleshy berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and stream banks. Rhamnus macrocarpa plays a role in providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
