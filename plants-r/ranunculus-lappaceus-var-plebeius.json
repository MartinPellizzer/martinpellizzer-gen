    "intro": "Ranunculus lappaceus var. plebeius, commonly known as the alpine buttercup, is a low-growing perennial herb native to alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It features basal leaves that are palmately divided with hairy surfaces, and its flowers are typically yellow with five petals. The plant produces small, green, follicle-like fruits that contain seeds with tufts of silky hair for wind dispersal. It thrives in moist, rocky soils and is often found in mountain meadows and tundra habitats. Due to its delicate structure and preference for high-altitude environments, it is considered a characteristic species of alpine flora."
