    "intro": "Rotala leptopetala f. setifera, commonly known as the thread-leaved rotala, is a compact aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It features finely divided, thread-like leaves that float on the water surface, giving it a delicate, lace-like appearance. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in summer, adding a subtle ornamental touch to freshwater habitats. It thrives in shallow, slow-moving waters with moderate to high light exposure. Its rapid growth makes it a popular choice for pond and aquarium landscaping."
