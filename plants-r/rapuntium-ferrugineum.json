    "intro": "Rapuntium ferrugineum, commonly known as the rusty cress, is a flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and hairy, lobed leaves that are often covered in a reddish-brown hue. This plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is found in meadows, along stream banks, and in damp woodlands. Its seeds are enclosed in a capsule that splits open to release the tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Rapuntium ferrugineum is a perennial herb that is often used in traditional medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory properties."
