It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its large, white, fragrant flowers that open at night. The plant typically grows as an erect shrub with woody stems and broad, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are tubular and have a distinctive, waxy texture, while the fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, shiny seeds.
