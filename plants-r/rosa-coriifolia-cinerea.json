    "intro": "Rosa coriifolia cinerea, commonly known as the greyleaf shrub rose, is a deciduous shrub native to parts of Asia, particularly China. It is characterized by its finely textured, silvery-gray foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers in early spring, which are followed by red-orange hips in the fall. Its stems are covered in a dense layer of grayish pubescence, contributing to its unique visual appeal. Rosa coriifolia cinerea is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively hardy in temperate climates."
