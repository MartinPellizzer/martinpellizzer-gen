    "intro": "Rhagadiolus taraxacoides, commonly known as the African dandelion, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features a rosette of basal leaves that are typically hairy and have a waxy coating. The plant produces bright yellow composite flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. After flowering, it develops fluffy seed heads that are dispersed by the wind, a characteristic shared with other members of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and rocky areas."
