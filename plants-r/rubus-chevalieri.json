    "intro": "Rubus chevalieri, commonly known as the Chevalier blackberry, is a species of shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Rubus genus, which includes many brambles and blackberries, and is characterized by its thorny stems and aggregate fruits. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically edible, though they may have a tart flavor. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and potential for cultivation, it is occasionally grown in gardens and botanical collections."
