    "intro": "Rosa intricata, commonly known as the desert rose or desert pink, is a species of flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, fragrant pink or white flowers. The plant has small, narrow leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Rosa intricata is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
