    "intro": "Rhododendron campylogynum var. eupodum, commonly known as the dwarf rhododendron, is a compact evergreen shrub native to the eastern Himalayas. It features broad, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and densely packed on short, woody stems. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It prefers acidic, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in cooler, moist environments."
