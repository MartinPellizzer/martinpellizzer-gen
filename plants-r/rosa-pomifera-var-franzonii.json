    "intro": "Rosa pomifera var. franzonii, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a rare and highly valued species within the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, dark wood with a rich, oily texture, making it prized for musical instrument making. The plant is native to the Atlantic rainforests of Brazil and is known for its slow growth and longevity. Its botanical features include compound leaves and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in spring. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now critically endangered and protected in many regions."
