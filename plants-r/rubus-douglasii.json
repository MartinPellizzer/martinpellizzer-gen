    "intro": "Rubus douglasii, commonly known as Douglas's blackberry, is a species of brambles native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows in moist, shaded areas such as forest understories and along streambanks. The plant features thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. Its flowers are white and clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences, followed by dark purple to black berries. The berries are edible, though often tart, and are used in jams and preserves."
