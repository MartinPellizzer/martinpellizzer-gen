    "intro": "Rumex occidentalis var. fenestratus, commonly known as the fenestrated dock, is a perennial herb native to western North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, deeply lobed leaves that often have a fenestrated or window-like appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in wetlands, meadows, and along stream banks. It produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by elongated, ribbed seed pods. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used historically in traditional medicine."
