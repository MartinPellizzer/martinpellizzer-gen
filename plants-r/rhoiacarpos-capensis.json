    "intro": "Rhoiacarpos capensis, commonly known as the Cape daisy, is a perennial herb native to the coastal regions of South Africa. It features erect, branching stems that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy appearance. The plant produces showy, daisy-like flowers with white petals and a yellow center, blooming in spring and summer. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a slightly serrated edge. Rhoiacarpos capensis is well adapted to coastal conditions, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils."
