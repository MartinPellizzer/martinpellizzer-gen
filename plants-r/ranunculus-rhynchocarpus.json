It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves and showy, yellow flowers with numerous stamens. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its fruits are follicles that release seeds when mature, contributing to its propagation. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
