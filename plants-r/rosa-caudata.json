    "intro": "Rosa caudata, commonly known as the trailing rose, is a species of flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with long, arching stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces fragrant, single or double flowers in shades of pink and white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with serrated leaflets, and it thrives in well-drained soil and full sun. Rosa caudata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to form dense ground cover."
