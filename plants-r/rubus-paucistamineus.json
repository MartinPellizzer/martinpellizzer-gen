    "intro": "Rubus paucistamineus, commonly known as the few-stamine blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the western United States. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Botanically, it is notable for its reduced number of stamens in its flowers, which is a distinguishing feature of its name."
