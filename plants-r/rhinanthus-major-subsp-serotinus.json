    "intro": "Rhinanthus major subsp. serotinus, commonly known as the late common tickseed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially depends on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Its flowering period extends into autumn, distinguishing it from other subspecies of Rhinanthus."
