    "intro": "Rubus pseudocaesius var. caesiodumetroum, commonly known as the blueberry rose, is a variant of the brambles native to certain regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dark purple to nearly black berries, which are typically small and clustered. The plant produces fragrant, pink to white flowers in the spring, which are often followed by the fruiting season in late summer. Its leaves are usually compound, with serrated edges, and the stems are armed with thorns. This variety is valued for both its ornamental appeal and its edible fruits, though it is less commonly cultivated than other Rubus species."
