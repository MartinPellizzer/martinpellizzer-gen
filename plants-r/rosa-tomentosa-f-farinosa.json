It is characterized by its dense, white tomentose (fuzzy) covering on the stems, leaves, and flowers, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically produces pale pink to white flowers with five petals, and its foliage is thick and pubescent. It is a shrub native to regions of Asia, including China and Japan, and thrives in temperate climates. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens for its unique texture and visual appeal."
