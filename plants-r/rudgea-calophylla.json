    "intro": "Rudgea calophylla, commonly known as the red-barked rudgea, is a striking tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark that peels in thin layers, giving it a unique appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom throughout the year, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a waxy texture, which helps reduce water loss in its native habitat. Rudgea calophylla is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in warm, humid climates for its visual appeal."
