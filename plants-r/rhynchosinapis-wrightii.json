    "intro": "Rhynchosinapis wrightii, commonly known as the Wright's beakvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its upright growth habit and compound leaves. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple, typically blooming in late spring. Rhynchosinapis wrightii is adapted to dry, rocky habitats and is often found in sagebrush steppe ecosystems. Its root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it an ecologically important species in its native range."
