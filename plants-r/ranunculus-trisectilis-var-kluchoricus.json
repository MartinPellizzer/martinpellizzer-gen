    "intro": "Ranunculus trisectilis var. kluchoricus, commonly known as the Kluchoricus buttercup, is a rare and striking member of the Ranunculaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, trifoliate leaves and showy, yellow flowers with a distinctive central division. Native to specific regions in Central Asia, this variant is adapted to high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
