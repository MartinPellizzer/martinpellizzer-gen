    "intro": "Robinia pinnata, commonly known as the false acacia or honey locust, is a deciduous leguminous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and often have a silvery underside. The plant produces long, cylindrical pods that contain several seeds, and it is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in various soil types. Robinia pinnata has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion, and it is often used in reforestation projects. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange and bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
