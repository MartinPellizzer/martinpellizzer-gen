    "intro": "Racosperma hopperianum, commonly known as the Hopper's acacia, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Western Australia. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod-bearing fruits. The plant features slender, often thorned stems and bipinnate leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. Its flowers are typically yellow or yellow-green, arranged in compact clusters, and it produces legume pods that contain several seeds. Racosperma hopperianum is well adapted to dry conditions, with mechanisms to reduce water loss and tolerate high temperatures."
