    "intro": "Rhododendron elongatum, commonly known as the long-stemmed rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia, particularly China and Korea. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to deep red. The plant typically grows in acidic, well-drained soils and thrives in shady, humid environments. Its leaves are dark green, leathery, and arranged in whorls around the stems. Rhododendron elongatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its spring blossoms."
