    "intro": "Ruthea interrupta, commonly known as the purple coneflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to eastern North America. It features showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has a robust root system and grows in moist, well-drained soils, often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and it produces a distinctive, spiky seed head that persists into winter. Ruthea interrupta is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native gardens."
