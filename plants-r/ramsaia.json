    "intro": "Ramsaia, commonly known as the swamp willow, is a shrub or small tree native to wetland environments in Europe and Asia. It typically grows in marshy areas, riverbanks, and other moist soils, thriving in conditions with high water tables. The plant has slender, often drooping branches and produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers in early spring. Its leaves are elongated and lance-shaped, often covered in fine hairs. Ramsaia is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic and terrestrial wildlife."
