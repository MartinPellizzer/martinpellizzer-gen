    "intro": "Rosa tomentella var. murbeckiana, commonly known as the Murbeck's woolly rose, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and fragrant, pink to white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its leaves are generally covered in a fine, white down, which helps to reduce water loss in its arid habitat. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
