    "intro": "Rosa villosa var. gedrensis, commonly known as the hairy rose or the rough rose, is a shrub-like species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems, which are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink to white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets with serrated edges. Rosa villosa var. gedrensis is well adapted to harsh, alpine environments and is often found growing at high elevations."
