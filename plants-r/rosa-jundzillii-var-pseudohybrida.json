    "intro": "Rosa jundzillii var. pseudohybrida, commonly known as the Jundzillii rose, is a hybrid shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges, typical of many rose species. The plant produces fragrant, semi-double flowers in shades of pink and white, which bloom in late summer. It is well adapted to harsh climates and requires well-drained soil and full sun. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a parent species in the development of many modern garden roses."
