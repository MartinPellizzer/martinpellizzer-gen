    "intro": "Rubus festivus, commonly known as the festival bramble, is a deciduous shrub native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits known as drupes, which are typically red or black in color. It thrives in woodland edges and disturbed soils, preferring partial shade to full sun. Rubus festivus plays a role in supporting local wildlife, particularly birds and insects, due to its flowering and fruiting habits."
