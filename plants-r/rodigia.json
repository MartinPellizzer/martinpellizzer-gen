    "intro": "Rodigia, commonly known as the marsh hibiscus, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the Malvaceae family. These plants are typically found in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swamps, across the southeastern United States. Rodigia species are characterized by their showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. The leaves are usually heart-shaped and have a rough texture, while the stems are often covered in fine hairs. The plant plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing wetland soils."
