    "intro": "Rosa canina subvar. rorida, commonly known as the coastal rose, is a shrub native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and small, fragrant pink flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces orange-red hips, which are rich in vitamin C and used in traditional medicine. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to salt-laden air. Its botanical features make it well-suited for coastal environments and ornamental gardening."
