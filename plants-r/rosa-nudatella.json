    "intro": "Rosa nudatella, commonly known as the naked-stem rose, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, often hairless stems and small, fragrant pink flowers. Native to parts of Asia, particularly China, it thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil. The plant produces oval, green leaves with serrated edges, and its fruit is a red, hairy rose hip. Rosa nudatella is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate blooms."
