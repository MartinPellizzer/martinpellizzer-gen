    "intro": "Rubus rhombifolius microgene dentulifer, commonly known as the narrow-leaved blackberry, is a shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its rhomboid-shaped leaves, which are typically finely toothed along the margins. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are dark purple to black when mature. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodland edges and thickets. Its botanical features make it distinguishable from other Rubus species, particularly in its leaf morphology and fruit structure."
