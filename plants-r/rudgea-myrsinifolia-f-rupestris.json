    "intro": "Rudgea myrsinifolia f. rupestris, commonly known as the rocky rupestris, is a compact, low-growing shrub native to the rocky and arid regions of South America. It features small, dark green, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers during the spring and early summer. It is well adapted to poor, well-drained soils and can thrive in full sun to partial shade. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and as a ground cover in xeriscaped landscapes."
