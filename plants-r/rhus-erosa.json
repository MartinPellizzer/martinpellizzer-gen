    "intro": "Rhus erosa, commonly known as smooth sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and have serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by red, fuzzy berries that are a food source for birds and wildlife. Smooth sumac thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in open woodlands, fields, and along roadsides. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it an important component of many ecological systems."
