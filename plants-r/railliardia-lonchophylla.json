    "intro": "Railliardia lonchophylla, commonly known as the golden bell orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It features a compact rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces striking yellow flowers that are clustered in a bell-shaped inflorescence, giving it its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Railliardia lonchophylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
