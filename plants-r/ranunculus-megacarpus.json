It features showy, yellow flowers with deeply lobed petals that resemble those of the common buttercup. The plant typically grows up to 1 meter tall, with a hairy stem and trifoliate leaves. Its flowers bloom in spring and are pollinated by insects. The plant contains toxic compounds, making it potentially harmful if ingested."
