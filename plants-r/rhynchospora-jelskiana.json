It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes grass-like plants known as sedges. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, forming dense clumps with upright, cylindrical stems. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are arranged in spike-like clusters, and it produces tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Rhynchospora jelskiana plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
