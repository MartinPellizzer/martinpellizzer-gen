    "intro": "Rumex \u00d7 triplex, commonly known as the three-leaved sorrel, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Rumex acetosa (common sorrel) and Rumex acetobulus (broadleaf sorrel). It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three heart-shaped leaflets, giving it a distinct appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, fertile soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed areas. It produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by reddish-brown seed capsules. Rumex \u00d7 triplex is valued for its edible leaves, which have a tangy, sour flavor similar to other sorrel species."
