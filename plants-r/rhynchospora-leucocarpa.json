It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and other grass-like plants. The plant is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves.

The fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that contains several seeds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in aquatic or semi-aquatic settings."
