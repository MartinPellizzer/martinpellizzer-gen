    "intro": "Rubus refractus, commonly known as the creeping blackberry, is a species of brambles native to eastern North America. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows along the ground, forming dense mats with thorny stems. The plant produces small, edible blackberries that ripen in the fall, attracting various wildlife. Its leaves are alternate, compound, and have a serrated edge, while the flowers are white and clustered in corymbs. The plant is often found in moist, wooded areas and is valued for both its ecological role and its fruit."
