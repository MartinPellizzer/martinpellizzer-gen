    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus subsp. palmgrenii, commonly known as the palmgren's buttercup, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its showy, yellow flowers with five petals. The subspecies is distinguished by its palmately lobed leaves and shorter, more compact growth habit compared to the typical form. It thrives in alpine and subalpine environments, often growing in rocky or gravelly soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
