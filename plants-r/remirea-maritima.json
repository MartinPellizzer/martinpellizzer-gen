    "intro": "Remirea maritima, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flower heads, which are surrounded by spiny bracts. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in salt marshes and dunes. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid or saline environments. Remirea maritima plays an important ecological role by stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various insects and birds."
