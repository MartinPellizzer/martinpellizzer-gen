    "intro": "Ricinocarpus multicaulis, commonly known as the giant fan palm, is a tall, tree-like plant native to the coastal regions of eastern Australia. It is characterized by its large, fan-shaped leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter, giving it a distinctive and imposing appearance. The plant has a robust trunk with a fibrous, spongy interior, which provides structural support and helps it withstand strong coastal winds. Its reproductive structures include small, greenish flowers that develop into woody, three-lobed fruits. Ricinocarpus multicaulis plays an important ecological role in coastal ecosystems, offering habitat and food for various wildlife species."
