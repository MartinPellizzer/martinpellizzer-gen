    "intro": "Rebutia candiae, commonly known as the Canary Island cactus, is a species of flowering cactus native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and its ability to produce vibrant, showy flowers in shades of yellow and orange. The plant features thick, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. Its flowers typically bloom in the spring and are borne on short, erect pedicels. Rebutia candiae is a popular choice for rock gardens and container cultivation due to its low maintenance requirements and ornamental value."
