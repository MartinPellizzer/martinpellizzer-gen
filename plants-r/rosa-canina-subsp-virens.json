    "intro": "Rosa canina subsp. virens, commonly known as the greenleaf dogrose, is a subspecies of the dogrose native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its slender, thorny stems and pinnately lobed leaves that are typically a lighter green than those of the typical Rosa canina. The flowers are usually pink or white, with five petals, and appear in late spring to early summer. The subspecies is distinguished by its foliage color and slightly different growth habit compared to the more common Rosa canina. It produces red, hairy fruits known as hips, which are often used in traditional herbal remedies."
