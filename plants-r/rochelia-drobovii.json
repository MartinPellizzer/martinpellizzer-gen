    "intro": "Rochelia drobovii, commonly known as the Drobovii's rochelia, is a rare and unique plant species belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of white or pale yellow. The plant is native to specific regions in southern Europe, particularly in the Carpathian Mountains, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires careful conservation efforts. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and taxonomic studies."
