    "intro": "Rutidosis lanata, commonly known as the woolly nightshade, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by spherical, berry-like fruits. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its toxic properties, it is important to handle the plant with care."
