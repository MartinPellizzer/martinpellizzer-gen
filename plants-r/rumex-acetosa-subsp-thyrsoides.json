    "intro": "Rumex acetosa subsp. thyrsoides, commonly known as sour dock, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features upright, branched stems that are often reddish in color, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a wavy margin. The plant produces dense clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are edible, though they are typically bitter and often used in foraging or traditional medicine. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in fields, along roadsides, and in disturbed areas."
