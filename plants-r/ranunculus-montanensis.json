    "intro": "Ranunculus montanensis, commonly known as the alpine buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It features showy, yellow flowers with five to eight petals and a hairy, upright stem. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky soils, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are palmately lobed and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Ranunculus montanensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil."
