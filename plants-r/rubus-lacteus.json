    "intro": "Rubus lacteus, commonly known as the milky raspberry, is a species of bramble native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and is often found in moist, wooded areas. The plant produces small, red, aggregate fruits that are edible but have a tart flavor. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the stems are covered in fine, white hairs. The species is notable for its milky sap, which can cause skin irritation in some individuals."
