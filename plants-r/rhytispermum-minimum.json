    "intro": "Rhytispermum minimum, commonly known as the small rhytispermum, is a rare and diminutive flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes many aromatic herbs and vegetables. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and finely divided leaves, typical of the carrot family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Rhytispermum minimum is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
