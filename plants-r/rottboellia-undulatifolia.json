    "intro": "Rottboellia undulatifolia, commonly known as the wavyleaf grass, is a perennial herb native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features narrow, grass-like leaves with a distinctive wavy edge, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or along streambanks. Rottboellia undulatifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping or as a ground cover."
