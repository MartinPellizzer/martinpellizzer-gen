    "intro": "Rollinia xylopiifolia, commonly known as the Brazilian star-apple tree, is a tropical plant native to South America. It is characterized by its broad, leathery leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that eventually develop into yellow or orange fruits resembling small apples. The fruit has a sweet, aromatic pulp with a texture similar to a pear, and it is often used in culinary applications. Rollinia xylopiifolia is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its shade-providing canopy."
