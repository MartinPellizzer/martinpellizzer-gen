    "intro": "Rapuntium irriguum, commonly known as the water cress, is a flowering plant native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its small, edible leaves and clusters of tiny white flowers. The plant thrives in moist environments, such as along stream banks and in wet meadows. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes other cruciferous plants like broccoli and mustard. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seed dispersal make it both a useful crop and a potential weed."
