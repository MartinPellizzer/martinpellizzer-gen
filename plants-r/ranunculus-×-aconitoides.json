    "intro": "Ranunculus \u00d7 aconitoides, commonly known as the hybrid buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features showy, double flowers with numerous yellow petals and a central cluster of yellow stamens, resembling a daisy. The plant has finely divided, trifoliate leaves that are hairy and emit a strong, often unpleasant odor. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens but can become invasive in natural habitats."
