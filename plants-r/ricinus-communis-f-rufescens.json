    "intro": "Ricinus communis f. rufescens, commonly known as the red-leaf castor plant, is a variant of the castor oil plant characterized by its distinctive reddish foliage. It is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Africa. The plant features large, palmately lobed leaves that can range in color from deep red to maroon, especially under certain light conditions. It produces spiny capsules containing toxic seeds, which are used in traditional medicine and as a source of castor oil. This ornamental plant is often cultivated for its striking appearance and is relatively easy to grow in warm climates."
