    "intro": "Rubus pustulatus, commonly known as the rough raspberry, is a species of bramble native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, red, edible fruits. The plant typically grows in woodland edges, hedgerows, and other moist, shaded habitats. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges and a hairy texture. The flowers are white or pale pink, appearing in early summer before the fruits ripen."
