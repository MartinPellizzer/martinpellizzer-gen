    "intro": "Rosa coerulescens, commonly known as the blue rose, is a rare and striking hybrid rose species. It is characterized by its unique deep blue or violet petals, which are a result of a recessive gene that inhibits the production of red pigments. Native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, this plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils. It produces fragrant flowers that bloom in late summer, and its stems are covered in thorns. Due to its rarity and aesthetic appeal, Rosa coerulescens is highly valued in horticulture and botanical research."
