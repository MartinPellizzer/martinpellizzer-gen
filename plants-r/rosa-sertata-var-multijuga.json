    "intro": "Rosa sertata var. multijuga, commonly known as the many-fruited shrub rose, is a deciduous shrub native to parts of Asia, including China and Japan. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and small, clustered flowers that range from white to pink in color. The plant produces multiple small, red fruits that are typically eaten by birds, aiding in seed dispersal. Its foliage consists of pinnately compound leaves with serrated edges, and it thrives in well-drained soils with partial to full sunlight. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in traditional medicine."
