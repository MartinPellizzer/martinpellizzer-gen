    "intro": "Rhynchospora recurvata, commonly known as the recurved sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often reddish or purple in color. The plant produces small, clustered flower spikes that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its flowers are usually pale green to brown and are pollinated by wind rather than insects. Rhynchospora recurvata plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
