    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 semisulcatus var. arenaceus, commonly known as the sand raspberry, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or yellow when ripe. The plant thrives in well-drained sandy soils and is adapted to harsh, semi-arid environments. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it produces white or pale pink flowers in the spring. This variety is valued for its resilience and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes or as a source of edible berries."
