    "intro": "Ruppia subsessilis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sea rocket, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a halophyte, meaning it thrives in saline environments such as salt marshes and estuaries. The plant has small, inconspicuous white flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to reduce water loss in salty conditions. Ruppia subsessilis plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
