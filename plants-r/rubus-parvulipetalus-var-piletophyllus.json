    "intro": "Rubus parvulipetalus var. piletophyllus, commonly known as the small-petaled blackberry variant, is a shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is characterized by its slender, thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The flowers are small, white to pale pink, and typically appear in clusters. The fruit, a small, dark purple to black berry, develops from the flower and is often used in jams and wines. This variety is distinguished by its unique leaf morphology, with the upper surface being notably hairy."
