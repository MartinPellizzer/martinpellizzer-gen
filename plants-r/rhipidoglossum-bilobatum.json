    "intro": "Rhipidoglossum bilobatum, commonly known as the two-lobed tongue fern, is a rare and specialized fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, bipinnate fronds that feature a distinctive two-lobed structure at the base, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories where it can thrive in the dappled light. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are positioned on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Rhipidoglossum bilobatum is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
