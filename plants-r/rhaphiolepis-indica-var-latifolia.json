    "intro": "Rhaphiolepis indica var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf firethorn, is a deciduous shrub native to China. It features small, glossy dark green leaves that are broader than those of the typical variety, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright orange-red berries in the fall. These berries are edible but have a tart flavor and are often used in culinary applications. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and adaptability to various soil conditions."
