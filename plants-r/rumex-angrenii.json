    "intro": "Rumex angrenii, commonly known as Armenian sorrel, is a perennial herb native to the Caucasus region. It features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive reddish coloration, often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. Its leaves are edible and have a sour taste due to the presence of oxalic acid. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in forest understories."
