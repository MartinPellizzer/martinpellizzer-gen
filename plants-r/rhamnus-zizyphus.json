    "intro": "Rhamnus zizyphus, commonly known as the common buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows to a height of 2\u20136 meters and features dark green, oval leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by black, berry-like fruits that are rich in anthocyanins. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges, hedgerows, and disturbed areas. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential in some regions, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
