    "intro": "Rosa pomifera var. friburgensis, commonly known as the Friburg rose, is a rare and distinctive variant of the rose species. It is characterized by its large, edible fruits, which are often referred to as \"rose hips\" and are rich in vitamin C. The plant is native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe and thrives in cooler climates. Its flowers are typically pink or white, and it produces a dense, thorny growth habit. Due to its limited distribution and unique botanical features, it is considered a valuable species for both horticultural and ecological studies."
