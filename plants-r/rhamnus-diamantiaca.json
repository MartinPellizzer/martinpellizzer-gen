    "intro": "Rhamnus diamantiaca, commonly known as the Diamantina buckthorn, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Canary Islands. It typically grows in coastal and rocky habitats, characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in the spring, followed by dark blue, fleshy berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. Its hardy nature and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions make it a resilient species in its native range."
