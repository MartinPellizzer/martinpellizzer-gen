    "intro": "Rosa alpina var. glandulosa, commonly known as the alpine rose with glandular hairs, is a variant of the alpine rose native to mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, glandular pubescence on the stems and leaves, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh, high-altitude environment. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, pink or white flowers that bloom in early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and have a serrated edge, adapted to withstand cold temperatures and strong winds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
