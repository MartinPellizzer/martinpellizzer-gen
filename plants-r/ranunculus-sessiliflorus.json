    "intro": "Ranunculus sessiliflorus, commonly known as the sessile-flowered buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks. The plant features a basal rosette of leaves with deeply lobed or divided foliage, and its flowers are usually yellow with five petals and numerous stamens. It blooms from late spring to early summer, producing showy, cup-shaped flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
