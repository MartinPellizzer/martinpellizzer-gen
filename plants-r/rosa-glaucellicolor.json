    "intro": "Rosa glaucellicolor, commonly known as the glaucous pink rose, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its pale pink to white petals and a distinctive bluish-gray bloom on its stems and leaves. Native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, this plant thrives in cool, temperate climates. The leaves are simple, alternate, and covered in a fine, waxy coating that gives them their characteristic glaucous appearance. It produces fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
