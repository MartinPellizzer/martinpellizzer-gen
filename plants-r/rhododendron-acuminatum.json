    "intro": "Rhododendron acuminatum, commonly known as the sharp-toothed rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of East Asia, particularly in China, Korea, and Japan. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows in cool, moist environments, often in forest understories. The plant features lance-shaped leaves with acuminate tips and produces clusters of bell-shaped, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. Its botanical characteristics include showy inflorescences and a preference for acidic, well-drained soils. Rhododendron acuminatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
