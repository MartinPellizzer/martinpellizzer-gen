    "intro": "Rumex domesticus var. rotundus, commonly known as broadleaf sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features heart-shaped, dark green leaves with a distinctive reddish or purple coloration on the veins, which are often tinged with anthocyanins. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, rich soils and is often found in woodland edges, meadows, and along stream banks. Its leaves are edible but contain oxalic acid, so they should be cooked before consumption."
