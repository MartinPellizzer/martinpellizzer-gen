    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 pseudocondensatus, commonly known as the blackberry-loganberry hybrid, is a deciduous shrub belonging to the Rosaceae family. It is a natural hybrid between Rubus ursinus (blackberry) and Rubus loganobaccus (loganberry), resulting in a plant that combines characteristics of both parents. The plant produces large, dark purple to black berries that are typically larger and sweeter than those of its parent species. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and edible fruit. The leaves are compound, with three to five leaflets, and the plant is known for its thorny stems."
