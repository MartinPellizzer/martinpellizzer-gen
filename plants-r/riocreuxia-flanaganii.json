It is a small, mat-forming succulent that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are usually white or pale blue in color. It is adapted to arid environments and is often found in coastal regions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
