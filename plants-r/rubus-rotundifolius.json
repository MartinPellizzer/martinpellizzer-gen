    "intro": "Rubus rotundifolius, commonly known as the rounded-leaved blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and thorny stems, which support its climbing structure. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its fruit, a dark purple to black berry, is typically harvested in late summer. The leaves are distinctive for their rounded shape and serrated edges, contributing to its ornamental value."
