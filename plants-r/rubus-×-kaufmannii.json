    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 kaufmannii, commonly known as the evergreen blackberry, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Rubus ursinus (evergreen blackberry) and Rubus pectoralis (red-berried blackberry). It is characterized by its dense, thorny growth habit and dark green, leathery leaves that remain on the plant year-round. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically harvested in late summer. It is native to coastal regions of California and thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is often cultivated in gardens and agricultural settings."
