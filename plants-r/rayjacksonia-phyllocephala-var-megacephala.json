    "intro": "Rayjacksonia phyllocephala var. megacephala, commonly known as the giant leafy cycad, is a unique cycad species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, compound leaves that can grow up to several meters in length, giving it a distinctive and imposing appearance. The plant produces small, spore-bearing cones rather than flowers, typical of its gymnosperm classification. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine and as ornamental plants due to their striking foliage. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
