    "intro": "Ratzeburgia, commonly known as the golden torch cactus, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Cactaceae. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its distinctive, spiny stems and vibrant yellow flowers. The plants typically grow as shrubs or small trees, with thick, fleshy stems that store water, adapting to arid environments. Ratzeburgia species are often cultivated for their ornamental value due to their striking appearance and ability to thrive in well-drained soil. They produce showy, tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds."
