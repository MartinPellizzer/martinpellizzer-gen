    "intro": "Rubus tornatilis, commonly known as the spiral raspberry, is a species of bramble native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its distinctive spiraled inflorescence, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, edible red berries that are similar in taste to other raspberries. It thrives in moist, wooded areas and is often found in the understory of forests. The leaves are compound, with three to five leaflets, and the plant has thorny stems typical of the Rubus genus."
