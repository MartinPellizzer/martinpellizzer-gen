    "intro": "Rubus carpinifolius subsp. montanus, commonly known as the alpine blackberry, is a species of bramble native to mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its woody stems, trifoliate leaves, and small, aggregate fruits that ripen to a dark red or black color. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. It produces white to pale yellow flowers in early summer, followed by the development of its edible berries. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been introduced to other regions for horticultural purposes."
