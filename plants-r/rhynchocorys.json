    "intro": "Rhynchocorys, commonly known as the African violet, is a genus of flowering plants native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its fleshy, tuberous roots and showy, velvety flowers. The leaves are typically heart-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its native environment. Rhynchocorys species are popular houseplants due to their attractive foliage and ability to thrive in low-light conditions. They are also valued for their ability to bloom throughout the year under proper care."
