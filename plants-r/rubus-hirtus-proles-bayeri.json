    "intro": "Rubus hirtus proles bayeri, commonly known as the bayery raspberry, is a species of brambles native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, aggregate fruits that are typically red when ripe. The plant produces trifoliate leaves with serrated edges and has a woody structure typical of many Rubus species. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodlands and hedgerows. The fruit is edible, though it is generally more tart than other raspberry varieties."
