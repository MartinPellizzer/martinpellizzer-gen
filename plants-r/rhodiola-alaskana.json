    "intro": "Rhodiola alaskana, commonly known as the Alaska rose, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Arctic tundra and subarctic regions of North America. It belongs to the Crassulaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-like growth pattern and small, pink or white flowers. The plant thrives in cold, harsh environments and is adapted to low light conditions. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine for their purported adaptogenic properties. Rhodiola alaskana plays an important ecological role in its native habitats by providing food for various pollinators and small herbivores."
