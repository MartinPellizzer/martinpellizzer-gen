    "intro": "Ranunculus baudotii subsp. confusus, commonly known as the confused buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It features delicate, palmately lobed leaves and bright yellow, cup-shaped flowers with numerous stamens. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in meadows and woodland edges. It blooms from late spring to early summer, and its flowers are pollinated primarily by insects. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
