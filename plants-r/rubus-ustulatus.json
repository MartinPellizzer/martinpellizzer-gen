It is characterized by its thorny stems and dark purple to black berries that ripen in the fall. The plant typically grows in moist woodlands and along stream banks, preferring partial shade. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the flowers are white with five petals. The berries are edible but have a tart flavor, often used in jams and preserves."
