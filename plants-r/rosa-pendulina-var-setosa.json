    "intro": "Rosa pendulina var. setosa, commonly known as the bristly climbing rose, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, arching stems that can climb and trail along the ground. The plant produces fragrant, single or semi-double flowers in shades of pink to red, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its foliage consists of pinnate leaves with serrated edges and small, glandular hairs. The variety 'setosa' is distinguished by its dense, bristly hairs that cover the stems and leaves, giving it a unique textured appearance."
