    "intro": "Raptostylus zimmereri, commonly known as the dwarf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of specific host trees, primarily in the genus Eucalyptus. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis in its green stems. The plant forms a dense, tangled mass of stems and leaves, often creating a cushion-like structure on the host's bark. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically greenish or reddish, and it produces small, fleshy berries that are an important food source for birds. Raptostylus zimmereri is native to southeastern Australia and is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
