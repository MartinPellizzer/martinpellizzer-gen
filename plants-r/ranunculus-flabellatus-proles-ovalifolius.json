    "intro": "Ranunculus flabellatus proles ovalifolius, commonly known as the oval-leaved water buttercup, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in South America. It features delicate, yellow flowers with five petals and numerous stamens, typical of the Ranunculaceae family. The plant has oval-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating, adapted to aquatic conditions. Its roots are fibrous and help anchor it in muddy substrates. This species is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, contributing to aquatic biodiversity."
