    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 carnegreanus, commonly known as the Pacific blackberry, is a hybrid species within the Rubus genus, characterized by its thorny stems and aggregate fruits. It is native to the western coast of North America, particularly in regions with moist, temperate climates. The plant produces dark purple to black berries that are often used in culinary applications due to their tart flavor. Botanically, it exhibits traits of both its parent species, Rubus ursinus and Rubus pectoralis, leading to genetic variability. Its growth habit includes trailing or climbing vines, often found in coastal scrub and woodland habitats."
