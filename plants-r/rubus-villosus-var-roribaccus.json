    "intro": "Rubus villosus var. roribaccus, commonly known as the hairy blackberry or the alpine blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are generally smaller than those of common blackberries. Its leaves are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant is valued for its hardy nature and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats."
