    "intro": "Ruta obovata, commonly known as common rue, is a perennial shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features aromatic, dark green, oval-shaped leaves that are often used in herbal medicine. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, black berries. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for Mediterranean climates. Its essential oils, derived from the leaves, have been traditionally used for their antispasmodic and carminative properties."
