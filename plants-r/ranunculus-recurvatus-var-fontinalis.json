    "intro": "Ranunculus recurvatus var. fontinalis, commonly known as the spring beauty, is a delicate flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. The plant features small, white or pale yellow flowers with five petals, and its leaves are trifoliate, with three deeply lobed leaflets. It blooms in early spring, often before the canopy of trees has fully developed. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting early pollinators."
