    "intro": "Randia mollifolia, commonly known as the velvetleaf or swamp beauty, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is a shrub that typically grows up to 1.5 meters tall, featuring opposite, ovate leaves with a velvety texture. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from summer to autumn. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, dry seeds. Randia mollifolia is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks, where it thrives in moist, sunny conditions."
