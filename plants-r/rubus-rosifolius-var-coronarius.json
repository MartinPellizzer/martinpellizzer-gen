    "intro": "Rubus rosifolius var. coronarius, commonly known as the roseleaf bramble, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its finely divided, silvery-green leaves that resemble those of the rose, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by red, juicy berries in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas with partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is cultivated in some regions for both aesthetic and culinary purposes."
