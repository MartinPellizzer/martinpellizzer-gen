    "intro": "Ranunculus ollissiponensis, commonly known as the Ollissiponense buttercup, is a rare and endemic species native to a specific region in Portugal. It is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its delicate, palmate leaves and showy, yellow flowers with distinct black markings. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors or stream banks. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with similar floral structures. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
