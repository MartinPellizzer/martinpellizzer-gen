    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus subsp. smithii, commonly known as the Smith's golden ragwort, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Ranunculaceae family, characterized by its showy, yellow flowers with prominent, petal-like sepals. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and streambanks. It has palmately divided leaves and produces small, greenish flowers that bloom in early spring. Its subspecies status reflects subtle morphological differences from the nominate form, R. auricomus."
