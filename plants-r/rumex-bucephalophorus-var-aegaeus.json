    "intro": "Rumex bucephalophorus var. aegaeus, commonly known as the Etruscan sorrel, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive reddish tint. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are edible and have a tangy, sour flavor due to high oxalic acid content. It is often found in shaded woodland areas and is valued for both its ornamental and culinary uses."
