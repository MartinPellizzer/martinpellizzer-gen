    "intro": "Rubus rivularis microgene parvulipetalus, commonly known as the small-petaled blackberry, is a rare variant of the blackberry genus characterized by its diminutive, delicate petals. It is a shrub that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found along streambanks and in forest understories. The plant produces small, dark red to black berries that are less commonly consumed by humans but are an important food source for wildlife. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, with a subtle fragrance. Botanically, it is distinguished by its reduced floral structures and unique genetic traits that set it apart from other Rubus species."
