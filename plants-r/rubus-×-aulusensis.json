    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 aulusensis, commonly known as the blackberry loganberry, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Rubus ursinus (the blackberry) and Rubus loganobaccus (the loganberry). It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves, typical of the Rubus genus. The plant produces large, dark purple to black berries that are prized for their intense flavor and high antioxidant content. It thrives in temperate climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Due to its vigorous growth habit, it is often cultivated as a decorative and edible plant in gardens and orchards."
