    "intro": "Rubus calyculatus, commonly known as the Pacific blackberry, is a species of bramble native to western North America. It is characterized by its thorny stems and aggregate fruits, which are typically dark purple to black in color. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by the development of its edible berries. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the plant thrives in moist, temperate climates. Rubus calyculatus plays an important ecological role by providing food for various wildlife species."
