    "intro": "Rosa \u00d7 dumetorum var. subglandulosa, commonly known as the alpine rose or creeping rose, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with thorny stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The leaves are pinnately compound, typically with five to seven leaflets that are glandular-dotted on the underside. Its flowers are usually pink or white, with five petals and numerous stamens, blooming in early summer. This variety is valued for its hardiness and ornamental appeal in alpine gardens."
