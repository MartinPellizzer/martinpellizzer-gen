It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with a distinctive plicate (wrinkled) appearance on the underside. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black in color. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forested or rocky areas. Due to its ornamental value and edible berries, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
