    "intro": "Ricinus communis f. glaucus, commonly known as the glaucous castor oil plant, is a variant of the common castor plant characterized by its distinctive bluish-gray foliage. This cultivar features large, palmately lobed leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, powdery wax, giving them a unique appearance. The plant produces striking, spiny capsules containing toxic seeds, which are used in traditional medicine and as a source of castor oil. It thrives in warm, sunny climates and is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its striking foliage. The glaucous coating on its leaves also helps reduce water loss, making it relatively drought-tolerant."
