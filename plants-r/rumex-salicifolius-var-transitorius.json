    "intro": "Rumex salicifolius var. transitorius, commonly known as the transient dock, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically green with a slightly hairy surface, and it produces clusters of small, reddish-brown flowers in the summer. The plant is often found in moist, disturbed soils such as roadsides, meadows, and wetlands. Its botanical name reflects its association with the genus Rumex and its leaf shape resembling that of willow trees. It is known for its short lifespan in certain habitats, contributing to its common name."
