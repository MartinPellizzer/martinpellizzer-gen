It produces small, dark purple to black fruits that are typically harvested in late summer. The plant has compound leaves with three to five leaflets, and its stems are covered in fine, white hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and for local consumption."
