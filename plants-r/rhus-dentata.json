    "intro": "Rhus dentata, commonly known as staghorn sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged with serrated margins. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by red, fuzzy berries that mature in the fall. Its bark is thick and rough, often appearing fibrous and resembling the antlers of a stag, hence its common name. Rhus dentata is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in open woods, streambanks, and disturbed sites."
