    "intro": "Robinia flava, commonly known as yellow false acacia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and have a yellowish-green hue. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers in late spring, followed by elongated seed pods that split open to release its seeds. Robinia flava is adapted to well-drained soils and is often found in open woods or along stream banks. It has a deep root system that makes it drought-tolerant and resilient to environmental stress."
