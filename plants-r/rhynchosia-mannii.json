    "intro": "Rhynchosia mannii, commonly known as the African morning glory, is a climbing legume native to tropical Africa. It features heart-shaped leaves and produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant is characterized by its fibrous root system and the presence of pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fallow fields. Rhynchosia mannii is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been introduced to other regions for horticultural purposes."
