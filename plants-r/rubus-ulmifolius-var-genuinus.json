    "intro": "Rubus ulmifolius var. genuinus, commonly known as the common blackberry, is a species of brambles native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems, trifoliate leaves, and aggregate fruits that ripen to a dark purple or black color. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by the development of its edible berries. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, fertile ground. This plant is often found in hedgerows, woodland edges, and other disturbed areas."
