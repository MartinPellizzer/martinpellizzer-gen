    "intro": "Rudolfiella bicornaria, commonly known as the two-horned liverwort, is a small, thallose liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a distinctive lobed thallus with two prominent lobes that give it its common name. It lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead having a flattened, leaf-like structure called a thallus. Rudolfiella bicornaria is often found in temperate regions and is an indicator species for undisturbed, humid habitats."
