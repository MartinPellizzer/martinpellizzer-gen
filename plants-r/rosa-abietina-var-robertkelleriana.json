    "intro": "Rosa abietina var. robertkelleriana, commonly known as the Alpine rose or mountain rose, is a rare and cold-hardy shrub native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features small, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white to pink, often in clusters at the ends of its stems. The plant has dark green, leathery leaves that are adapted to withstand harsh mountain conditions. It typically grows in rocky or well-drained soils at high altitudes. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a valuable species for botanical study and conservation efforts."
