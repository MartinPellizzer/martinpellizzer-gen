    "intro": "Ranunculus affinis var. lasiocarpus, commonly known as the hairy-fruited buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features delicate, palmate leaves with a hairy texture, and its flowers are typically yellow with five to nine petals. The plant produces small, hairy fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. This variant is distinguished by its distinctive hairy fruiting structures, setting it apart from other ranunculus species."
