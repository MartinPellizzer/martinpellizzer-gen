    "intro": "Restrepia archilarum, commonly known as the Chilean violet orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Andes of Chile. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, rhizomatous growth habit. The plant produces small, violet-colored flowers that are typically arranged in a raceme, blooming in late spring. It thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found in rocky soils at high altitudes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
