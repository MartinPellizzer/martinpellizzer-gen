    "intro": "Rocama, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. Rocama is adapted to survive in harsh environments, storing water in its succulent stems and leaves. It is often used in traditional medicine and as an ornamental plant in dry landscapes."
