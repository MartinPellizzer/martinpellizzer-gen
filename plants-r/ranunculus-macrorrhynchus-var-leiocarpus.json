    "intro": "Ranunculus macrorrhynchus var. leiocarpus, commonly known as the white-flowered buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It features a short, rhizomatous rootstock and produces basal leaves that are deeply lobed and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with five petals, which are typically surrounded by numerous sepals. Its flowers are hermaphroditic, containing both male and female reproductive structures, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its propagation in suitable habitats."
