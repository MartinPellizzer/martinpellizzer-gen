    "intro": "Rubus kaltenbachii var. subalpinus, commonly known as the alpine bramble, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its dense, thorny growth and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits known as drupes, which are typically red or black in color. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, often in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is well adapted to cold climates and can withstand harsh environmental conditions."
