    "intro": "Roupala serratifolia, commonly known as the serrated roupala, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are serrated along the edges, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicle inflorescences, followed by elongated, woody fruits containing seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of tropical forests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
