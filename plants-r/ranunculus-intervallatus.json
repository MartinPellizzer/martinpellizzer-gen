    "intro": "Ranunculus intervallatus, commonly known as the alpine buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, bright yellow flowers with numerous stamens. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are palmately divided, and it produces small, hairy seeds that are dispersed by wind. Ranunculus intervallatus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
