    "intro": "Rapicactus beguinii subsp. beguinii, commonly known as the Beguin's rapicactus, is a species of cactus native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are typically green to blue-green in color. The plant produces white or pale yellow flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in inflorescences at the stem apex. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun exposure, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid climates. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in collections of succulents and cacti."
