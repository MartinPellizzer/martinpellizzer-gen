    "intro": "Reutera rigidula, commonly known as the rigid reutera, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. The plant features upright, stiff stems that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces capsule fruits containing several seeds. Reutera rigidula is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and resilience."
