    "intro": "Rosa sepium var. alba, commonly known as the white dogwood, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its clusters of small, white, showy flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, arching stems and broad, ovate leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. The white dogwood is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in cooler climates."
