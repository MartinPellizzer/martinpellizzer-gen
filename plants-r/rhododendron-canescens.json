    "intro": "Rhododendron canescens, commonly known as the grayleaf rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia, particularly China and Korea. It is characterized by its grayish-green, hairy leaves that provide a distinctive appearance. The plant produces showy clusters of pink to red flowers in the spring, which are typical of many rhododendron species. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and requires partial to full shade for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is often cultivated in gardens and natural habitats."
