    "intro": "Rhododendron fortunei, commonly known as the fortune rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of China. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring dense, leathery leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soil and requires partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is complemented by its hardy nature and ability to attract pollinators."
