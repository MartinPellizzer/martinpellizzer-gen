It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, where it thrives in cool, temperate climates. The plant is distinguished by its pale blue to lavender-colored flowers, which are typically smaller than those of the main species. Its leaves are trifoliate, with a slightly hairy texture, and it produces rose-like hips that are edible. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate floral display."
