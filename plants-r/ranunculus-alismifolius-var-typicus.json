It features delicate, trifoliate leaves that are often submerged or floating on the water's surface. The plant produces showy, yellow or orange flowers with five to eight petals, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. It thrives in shallow water and moist soils, often found in ponds, ditches, and stream margins. Its presence is an indicator of clean, unpolluted water environments."
