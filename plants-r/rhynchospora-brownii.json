    "intro": "Rhynchospora brownii, commonly known as the brown spike-rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and rushes, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spike-like clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Rhynchospora brownii thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems. Its presence is often an indicator of undisturbed aquatic habitats."
