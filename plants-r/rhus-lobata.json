    "intro": "Rhus lobata, commonly known as the coffeeberry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are divided into three to five oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits. These fruits are edible for humans and wildlife but contain toxic seeds that should be avoided. Rhus lobata is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments."
