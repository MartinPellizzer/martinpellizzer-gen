    "intro": "Robinia subdecandra, commonly known as the yellow-flowered false acacia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and have a distinctive yellowish-green color. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its bark is smooth and grayish, often peeling in thin strips, and it has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion. Robinia subdecandra is also notable for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it a valuable plant in ecological restoration projects."
