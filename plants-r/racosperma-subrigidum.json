    "intro": "Racosperma subrigidum, commonly known as the rigid acacia, is a shrub native to Australia. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its pod fruits and nitrogen-fixing capabilities. The plant has woody stems with a rough, ridged texture, and its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into small, feather-like segments. It produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by long, slender pods containing seeds. This species is often found in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments."
