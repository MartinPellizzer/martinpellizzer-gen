    "intro": "Rhynchosia angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf snout bean, is a climbing legume native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features slender, hairy stems and trifoliate leaves with narrow, elongated leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are followed by elongated, cylindrical pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides. Rhynchosia angustifolia is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability and is used in agroforestry systems."
