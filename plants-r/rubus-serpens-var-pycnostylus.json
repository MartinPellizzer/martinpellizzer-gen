    "intro": "Rubus serpens var. pycnostylus, commonly known as the dense-styled blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to certain regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically edible but have a tart flavor. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland areas or along riverbanks. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated for both ornamental and culinary purposes."
