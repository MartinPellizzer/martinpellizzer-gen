    "intro": "Rubus macrobothrys, commonly known as the large-flowered raspberry, is a species of brambles native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. It is characterized by its woody stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces showy, white to pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fruit, a aggregate berry, is typically red or yellow and is edible, though often tart. Rubus macrobothrys is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its role in local ecosystems."
