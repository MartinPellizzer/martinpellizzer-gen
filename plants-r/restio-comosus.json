    "intro": "Restio comosus, commonly known as the coastal restio, is a perennial grass-like plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It has slender, cylindrical stems that are often mistaken for grasses due to their similar appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. Restio comosus thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune environments. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
