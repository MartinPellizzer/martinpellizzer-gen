    "intro": "Romulea uliginosa var. debilis, commonly known as the bog romulea, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in southern Africa. It produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, with a distinctive, fragrant aroma. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and thrives in moist, acidic soils. It is often found in fens and marshes, where it plays a role in maintaining the ecological balance of these environments. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
