    "intro": "Rosa kostrakiewiczii, commonly known as the Kostrackei rose, is a rare and critically endangered species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces clusters of fragrant, pink to red flowers during the summer months. The plant has narrow, dark green leaves with serrated edges, and its stems are covered in dense, thorny bracts. Rosa kostrakiewiczii is adapted to harsh alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
