    "intro": "Ranunculus marylandicus, commonly known as Maryland buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its showy, yellow flowers with 5 to 15 sepals that resemble petals. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It has trifoliate leaves with three heart-shaped leaflets and produces small, green fruits that are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
