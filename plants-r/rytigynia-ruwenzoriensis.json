It belongs to the family Rytigyniaceae and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that are typically red or orange in color. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are adapted to the cool, moist conditions of its mountainous habitat. It is a herbaceous perennial that thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
