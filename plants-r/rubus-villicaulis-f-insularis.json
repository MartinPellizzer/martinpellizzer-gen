It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or island habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
