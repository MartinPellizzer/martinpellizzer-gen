    "intro": "Rosa obtusifolia var. plumosa, commonly known as the plumose evergreen rose, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage that remains evergreen throughout the year. The plant produces fragrant, pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are uniquely shaped with a feathery, plumose appearance, giving it a distinctive ornamental look. It is well-suited for coastal gardens due to its tolerance of salty air and well-drained soils."
