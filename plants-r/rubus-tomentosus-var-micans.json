    "intro": "Rubus tomentosus var. micans, commonly known as the velvet raspberry, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and clusters of small, red berries that ripen in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, woodland habitats and has a sprawling growth habit. Its leaves are trifoliate, with a velvety texture, and its stems are often covered in a thick layer of white tomentum. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
