    "intro": "Ranunculus heterorrhizus, commonly known as the lesser celandine, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves with a waxy surface and bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has a rhizomatous root system, which allows it to spread and colonize moist, shaded areas. It is often found in woodland floors and along stream banks, thriving in damp, nutrient-rich soils. Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation."
