    "intro": "Ranunculus depressus, commonly known as the meadow buttercup, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a basal rosette of heart-shaped, deeply lobed leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and the plant is often found in calcareous soils."
