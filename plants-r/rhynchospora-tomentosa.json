    "intro": "Rhynchospora tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly flatsedge, is a perennial herb native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage with hairy, grayish-green leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Rhynchospora tomentosa plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various small invertebrates."
