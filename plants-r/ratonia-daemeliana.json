    "intro": "Ratonia daemeliana, commonly known as the Daemel's ratonia, is a species of flowering plant native to specific regions in Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its hairy stems and broad, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pale pink to white in color, blooming during the warmer months. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
