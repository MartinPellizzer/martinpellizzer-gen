    "intro": "Rhododendron quadrasianum var. marivelesense, commonly known as the Mariveles rhododendron, is a rare and endemic species native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant typically grows in montane forest understories, thriving in cool, humid climates with well-drained soil. Its botanical features include leathery leaves and a compact growth habit, making it well adapted to its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical study and conservation efforts."
