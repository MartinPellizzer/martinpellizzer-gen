It is characterized by its broad, leathery leaves and clusters of small, aggregate fruits. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and has a woody stem with thorn-like projections. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, and it produces edible berries that are similar to those of other raspberry species. This variant is distinguished by its broader leaves compared to other Rubus species."
