    "intro": "Rudbeckia grandiflora var. alismifolia, commonly known as the waterleaf rudbeckia, is a perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that resemble those of the water plantain, hence its common name. The plant produces large, showy yellow daisy-like flowers with dark centers, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. This variety is valued in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
