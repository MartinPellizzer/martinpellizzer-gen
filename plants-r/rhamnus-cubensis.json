    "intro": "Rhamnus cubensis, commonly known as the Cuban buckthorn, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Caribbean, particularly Cuba. It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in axillary inflorescences, followed by small, black berries that are edible for some bird species. Rhamnus cubensis thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and disturbed habitats."
