    "intro": "Roella dunantii, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring woody stems and thick, fleshy leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, which bloom during the dry season. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access deep water sources in its harsh environment. Roella dunantii is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
