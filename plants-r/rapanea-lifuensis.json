    "intro": "Rapanea lifuensis, commonly known as the Lifu Island holly, is a species of flowering plant native to the island of Lifu in the Bismarck Archipelago. It is a small evergreen shrub characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and small, clustered white flowers. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that are typically red when mature. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in coastal and lowland forests. Due to its limited distribution, Rapanea lifuensis is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
