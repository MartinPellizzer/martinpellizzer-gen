    "intro": "Rockhausenia pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf rockhausenia, is a small, perennial herbaceous plant native to specific regions of southern Africa. It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. The plant features compact, low-growing foliage with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually appearing in clusters during the warmer months. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
