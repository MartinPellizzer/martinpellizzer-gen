    "intro": "Rhodiola phariensis, commonly known as the Tibetan rhodiola, is a perennial flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Crassulaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant is adapted to cold, arid environments and thrives at elevations above 3,000 meters. It is known for its ability to store water in its leaves, which helps it survive in harsh, mountainous climates. Rhodiola phariensis is also valued for its medicinal properties, traditionally used in Tibetan medicine."
