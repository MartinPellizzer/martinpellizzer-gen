    "intro": "Rogiera langlassei, commonly known as the Langlasse's rogeria, is a rare and specialized plant species belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in late spring. The plant is native to specific alpine regions in Central Europe, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species. Its botanical features make it an important subject for ecological and taxonomic studies."
