    "intro": "Rhizocephalus orientalis, commonly known as the oriental rhizocephalan, is a parasitic marine invertebrate belonging to the order Rhizocephala. It is characterized by its complex life cycle, which involves a free-swimming larval stage followed by a parasitic phase on crustacean hosts. The adult form is typically sessile, attaching itself to the exoskeleton of its host, often a crab, and developing specialized structures called \"haustoria\" to absorb nutrients. Its botanical aspects are less studied compared to its ecological impact, as it is not a plant but a parasitic organism. Rhizocephalus orientalis plays a significant role in marine ecosystems by influencing the behavior and survival of its host species."
