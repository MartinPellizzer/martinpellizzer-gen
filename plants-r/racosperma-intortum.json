    "intro": "Racosperma intortum, commonly known as the twisted acacia, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and pod fruits. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its distinctive twisted growth habit and yellow flowers make it a notable species in its native habitat. Racosperma intortum is often used in revegetation projects due to its resilience and ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
