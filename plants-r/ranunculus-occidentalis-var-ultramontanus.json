It is characterized by its delicate, spurred petals and blue to purple flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and stream banks. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss. It is a member of the Ranunculaceae family, known for its showy flowers and often toxic compounds."
