    "intro": "Rubus glaucellus subsp. luteistylus, commonly known as the yellow-styled blackberry, is a shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and thorny stems, which help it to climb and spread across rocky terrain. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black in color, with a slightly tart flavor. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges and a hairy underside, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often found in moist, shaded environments."
