    "intro": "Roeperocharis combusta, commonly known as the flameleaf dandelion, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, bright yellow flowers that resemble those of the common dandelion. The plant produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind, a typical feature of the Asteraceae family. Its leaves are alternate and often have a slightly hairy texture. Roeperocharis combusta thrives in open, sunny habitats and is adapted to dry conditions."
