    "intro": "Rhexia floridana, commonly known as the Florida rhexia, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Onagraceae and is characterized by its showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are erect and often branched. Rhexia floridana plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
