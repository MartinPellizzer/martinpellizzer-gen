    "intro": "Royena media, commonly known as the red-veined ivy, is a climbing evergreen vine native to South Africa. It features dark green, heart-shaped leaves with striking red veins that contrast vividly against the foliage. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters, which are followed by orange-red berries. It thrives in partial to full shade and prefers well-drained, moist soil. Due to its ornamental value, it is often used in hanging baskets or as a ground cover in shaded garden areas."
