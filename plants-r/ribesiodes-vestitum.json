    "intro": "Ribesiodes vestitum, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its hairy, velvety foliage. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a rough texture and a strong, aromatic scent. Its small, clustered flowers are usually white or pale yellow, blooming in early summer. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds."
