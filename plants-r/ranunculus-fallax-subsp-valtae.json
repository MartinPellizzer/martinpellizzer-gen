    "intro": "Ranunculus fallax subsp. valtae, commonly known as the Valtae buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features delicate, bright yellow flowers with finely divided, palmate leaves that are characteristic of the Ranunculaceae family. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. Its flowers bloom in early spring, adding a vibrant touch to high-altitude meadows. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
