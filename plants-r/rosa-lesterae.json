    "intro": "Rosa lesterae, commonly known as the Lesterae rose, is a rare and unique species of flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its delicate pink to white petals and a subtle, fragrant aroma. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and thrives in cool, temperate climates. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, yellowish-orange flowers in late spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Rosa lesterae is considered a botanical curiosity and is often sought after by horticulturists and plant enthusiasts."
