    "intro": "Rubus pseudopileatus, commonly known as the silverleaf bramble, is a species of shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its silvery-white undersides on its leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits known as drupes, typically red or black in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its thorny stems and dense growth habit make it a common invasive species in certain regions."
