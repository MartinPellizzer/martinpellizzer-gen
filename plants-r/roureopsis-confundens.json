    "intro": "Roureopsis confundens, commonly known as the red-flowered rock orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant red petals and sepals, which stand out against its green foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight. Its flowering period occurs during the late spring to early summer, producing clusters of small, fragrant blooms. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
