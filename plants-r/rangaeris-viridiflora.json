    "intro": "Rangaeris viridiflora, commonly known as the emerald-flowered orchid, is a striking member of the orchid family native to the humid rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant green petals and elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are glossy and waxy. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of green and white, which bloom during the wet season. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and requires well-draining soil rich in organic matter. Due to its unique appearance and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
