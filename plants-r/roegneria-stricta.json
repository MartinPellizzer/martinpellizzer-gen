    "intro": "Roegneria stricta, commonly known as blue grama, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, blue-green leaves that are typically 10\u201330 cm long. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are often clustered at the base of the leaf sheaths. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Blue grama is an important forage plant for livestock and plays a key role in stabilizing soils in grassland ecosystems."
