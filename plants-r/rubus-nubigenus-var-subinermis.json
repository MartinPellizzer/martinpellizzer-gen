    "intro": "Rubus nubigenus var. subinermis, commonly known as the cloud raspberry, is a species of bramble native to high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its erect or semi-erect growth habit and produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or orange in color. The plant has trifoliate leaves with serrated margins and produces white flowers with five petals. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
