    "intro": "Rubia hypocarpia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved gentian, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
