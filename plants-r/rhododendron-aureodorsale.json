    "intro": "Rhododendron aureodorsale, commonly known as the golden-back rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, golden-yellow undersides on its leaves, which contrast beautifully with its dark green upper surfaces. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink to reddish in color, blooming in early spring. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is often cultivated in horticultural settings."
