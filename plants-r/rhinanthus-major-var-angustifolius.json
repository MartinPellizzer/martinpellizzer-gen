    "intro": "Rhinanthus major var. angustifolius, commonly known as narrow-leaved yellow-rattle, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, characterized by its parasitic nature, as it derives nutrients from the roots of grasses and other plants. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in late summer, typically from July to September. It has slender, branched stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often narrow and pointed. This species is often found in grasslands and meadows, where it plays a role in seed dispersal and supports pollinator populations."
