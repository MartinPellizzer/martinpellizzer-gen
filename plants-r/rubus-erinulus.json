    "intro": "Rubus erinulus, commonly known as the silverleaf bramble, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea, and is often found in moist, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its slender, thorny stems and small, trifoliate leaves that have a silvery underside. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, and it produces small, edible berries that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant's hirsute (hairy) appearance and unique leaf structure make it easily distinguishable from other bramble species."
