    "intro": "Railliardia waianapanapaensis, commonly known as the Waianapanapa lily, is a rare endemic plant native to Hawaii. It belongs to the Melanthiaceae family and is characterized by its striking white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats, often in forest understories. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a basal rosette, while its flowering stems are slender and erect. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
