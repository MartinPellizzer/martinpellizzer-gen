    "intro": "Rumex palustris subsp. uliginosus, commonly known as swamp sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, nutrient-rich soils, often found in marshes, fens, and along the edges of ponds. The plant features alternate, lance-shaped leaves with a distinctive reddish or purple coloration on the underside. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and arranged in loose clusters, and it produces capsule fruits containing several seeds. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
