    "intro": "Ranunculus nidulans, commonly known as the creeping buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a low-growing, spreading habit with dark green, glossy leaves that are deeply lobed and covered in a fine layer of hairs. The plant produces bright yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth allows it to spread easily, making it both a common weed and an important component of certain ecosystems."
