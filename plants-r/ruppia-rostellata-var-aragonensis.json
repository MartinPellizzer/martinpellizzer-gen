    "intro": "Ruppia rostellata var. aragonensis, commonly known as the Aragonese sea rocket, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a halophyte, meaning it thrives in saline environments such as coastal marshes and brackish water. The plant has small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellowish in color. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to reduce water loss in salty conditions. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal sediments and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
