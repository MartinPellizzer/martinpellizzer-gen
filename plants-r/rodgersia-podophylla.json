    "intro": "Rodgersia podophylla, commonly known as the silver-leaf rodgersia, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the Saxifragaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of large, waxy, silver-green leaves. The plant produces showy, pinkish-red flowers in late summer, which are clustered in panicles. It thrives in partial shade and moist, well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its striking foliage and long blooming period."
