    "intro": "Roldana chiapensis, commonly known as the Chiapas roldana, is a flowering plant native to the humid forests of southern Mexico. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a glossy surface, while its flowers are usually white or pale pink. Due to its restricted habitat and limited research, Roldana chiapensis remains a relatively understudied species in botanical science."
