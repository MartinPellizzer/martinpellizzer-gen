    "intro": "Rhododendron cyclium, commonly known as the dwarf rhododendron, is a compact evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It features dense, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and glossy, providing a lush backdrop for its showy flowers. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance, it is often cultivated in temperate climates."
