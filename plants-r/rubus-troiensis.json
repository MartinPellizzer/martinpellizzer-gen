    "intro": "Rubus troiensis, commonly known as the Troian blackberry, is a species of brambles native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically harvested in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in hedgerows and woodland edges. Due to its rarity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
