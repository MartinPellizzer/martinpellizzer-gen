It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, dark purple berries that are edible and have a tart flavor. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and full sun exposure. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
