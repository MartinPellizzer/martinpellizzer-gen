    "intro": "Rhus perniciosa, commonly known as the staghorn sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are divided into pairs of oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in upright clusters, followed by red, fuzzy berries that are a food source for birds and wildlife. Its bark is thick and rugged, featuring a distinctive, horn-like texture, which gives it its common name. Rhus perniciosa thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and open areas."
