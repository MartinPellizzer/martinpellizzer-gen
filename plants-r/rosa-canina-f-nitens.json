    "intro": "Rosa canina f. nitens, commonly known as the pale dog rose, is a botanical variant of the dog rose. It is characterized by its pale pink to white flowers, which are typically smaller than those of the typical Rosa canina. The plant produces small, red, hairy fruits called hips, which are an important food source for birds and wildlife. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges and hedgerows. The leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the stems are covered in thorns."
