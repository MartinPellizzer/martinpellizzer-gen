    "intro": "Rhizophora \u00d7 annamalayana, commonly known as the mangrove apple or mangrove fig, is a hybrid species native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is a member of the Rhizophoraceae family and is characterized by its ability to thrive in saline and tidal environments. The plant exhibits pneumatophores, which are specialized root structures that facilitate gas exchange in waterlogged soils. Its leaves are typically alternate and ovate, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The fruit is a small, fleshy drupe that plays a role in seed dispersal by water and animals."
