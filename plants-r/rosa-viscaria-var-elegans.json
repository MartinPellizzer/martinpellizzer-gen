It is characterized by its vigorous, trailing growth habit and produces clusters of fragrant, pink to red flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant features narrow, dark green leaves with serrated edges and thorny stems, typical of many rose species. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for garden borders or as a ground cover.
