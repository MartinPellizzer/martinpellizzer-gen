    "intro": "Restrepiella ovatipetala, commonly known as the oval-petaled restrepiella, is a rare and unique flowering plant native to the Andean highlands of South America. It is characterized by its striking, elongated petals that are often a deep shade of violet or purple. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at elevations above 3,000 meters. Its flowers bloom during the cooler months, usually between September and November. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
