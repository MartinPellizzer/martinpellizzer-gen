It features delicate, palmate leaves and showy, yellow flowers with a distinctive golden center. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forest floors and stream banks. Its flowers bloom in spring and are pollinated by insects, particularly bees. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly different leaf shape and floral structure compared to the nominate form."
