    "intro": "Ruschia dissimilis, commonly known as the Cape marigold, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features compact, rounded rosettes of fleshy, blue-gray leaves that store water, adapting to arid environments. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, requiring minimal water once established. Ruschia dissimilis is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
