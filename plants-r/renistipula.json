    "intro": "Renistipula, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to regions of South America. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its seeds are encased in a hard, three-lobed capsule that splits open when mature. Renistipula is often found in disturbed habitats and can become invasive in certain areas."
