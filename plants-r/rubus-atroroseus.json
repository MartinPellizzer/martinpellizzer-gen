    "intro": "Rubus atroroseus, commonly known as the dark rose bramble, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in countries like Afghanistan and Pakistan. The plant is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, dark red to black berries. Its leaves are typically trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it produces fragrant white flowers in the spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species."
