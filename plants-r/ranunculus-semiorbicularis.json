It is characterized by its distinctive semicircular leaves and bright yellow flowers with numerous petals. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, preferring well-drained soils. It blooms in the spring and is often found in high-altitude meadows. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
