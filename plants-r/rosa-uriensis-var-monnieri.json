    "intro": "Rosa uriensis var. monnieri, commonly known as the Rocky Mountain climbing rose, is a shrub-like plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or open areas, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, red fruits known as hips. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in harsh, arid environments."
