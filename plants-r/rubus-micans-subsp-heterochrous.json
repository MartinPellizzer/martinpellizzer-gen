It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The flowers are typically white or pink, and the fruit is a red, aggregate berry. It thrives in woodland edges and disturbed soils, preferring partial shade. This subspecies is notable for its variability in leaf shape and color, which contributes to its common name."
