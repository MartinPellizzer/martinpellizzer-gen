    "intro": "Rhus vestita, commonly known as the silky dogwood, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces bright red berries that are an important food source for birds and small mammals. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a silvery underside that gives it its common name. Rhus vestita is often found in moist, wooded areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
