    "intro": "Rorippa trachycarpa, commonly known as the rough-seeded watercress, is a member of the Brassicaceae family. It is an aquatic or semi-aquatic plant that typically grows in wetlands, stream edges, and other moist environments. The plant has small, alternate leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are yellow and arranged in racemes, and it produces small, round, rough-textured seeds. Rorippa trachycarpa is often found in temperate regions and is adapted to thrive in shallow, freshwater habitats."
