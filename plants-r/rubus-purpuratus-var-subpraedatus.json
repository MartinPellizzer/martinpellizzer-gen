    "intro": "Rubus purpuratus var. subpraedatus, commonly known as the purple-leaf bramble, is a variant of the common blackberry species native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is characterized by its vibrant purple foliage, which contrasts with its dark red to black berries. The plant typically grows as a shrub with thorny stems and compound leaves, often found in moist, woodland environments. Its flowers are small, white, and clustered in umbels, followed by the development of edible berries. This variety is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its culinary uses."
