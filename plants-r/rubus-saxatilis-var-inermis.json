    "intro": "Rubus saxatilis var. inermis, commonly known as the smooth raspberry, is a species of bramble native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its thornless stems and hairy, lobed leaves that are typically dark green on top and paler underneath. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are usually red or yellow when ripe, making it attractive to birds and other wildlife. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands or along stream banks. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes or as a food source."
