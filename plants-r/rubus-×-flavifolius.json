It is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit and thorny stems, typical of many Rubus species. The plant produces aggregate fruits, which are typically dark purple to black when mature. Its leaves are distinctive for their yellowish-green coloration, which sets it apart from other blackberry varieties. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils."
