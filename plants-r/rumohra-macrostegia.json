    "intro": "Rumohra macrostegia, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is native to South America and is characterized by its large, floating fronds that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. The plant thrives in freshwater environments, such as ponds and slow-moving streams, where it forms dense mats on the water surface. Its fronds are pinnately compound, with long, slender pinnae that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. Rumohra macrostegia plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for aquatic organisms."
