    "intro": "Rubus spicatus, commonly known as prickly rose or bramble, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early summer. Its fruits, known as berries, are typically red and edible, though they are often tart and used in jams or wines. Rubus spicatus is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it thrives in woodland and hedgerow environments."
