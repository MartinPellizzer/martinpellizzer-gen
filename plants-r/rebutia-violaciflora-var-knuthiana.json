    "intro": "Rebutia violaciflora var. knuthiana, commonly known as the Knuth's violet-flowered rebutia, is a compact cactus native to South America. It features short, cylindrical stems that are ribbed and often covered in white or pale blue spines. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of violet or purple during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect light to flourish. Due to its compact size and ornamental flowers, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and container cultivation."
