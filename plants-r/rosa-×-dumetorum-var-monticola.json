    "intro": "Rosa \u00d7 dumetorum var. monticola, commonly known as the alpine rose, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces rose hips that are often red or orange in color. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in cooler climates."
