    "intro": "Rosa rubiginosa var. muricata, commonly known as the bristly rose, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of fragrant, pinkish-red flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces small, reddish-orange fruits called hips, which are edible and often used in culinary and medicinal applications. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the plant is drought-tolerant, making it adaptable to rocky and well-drained soils. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in hedgerows and garden landscapes."
