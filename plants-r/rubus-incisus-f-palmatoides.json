    "intro": "Rubus incisus f. palmatoides, commonly known as the broad-leafed blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant characterized by its distinctive, palmately lobed leaves. This form exhibits larger, more rounded leaflets compared to the typical Rubus incisus, giving it a unique appearance. It produces aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black in color, with a firm, tart flavor. The plant is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its botanical features make it a notable species within the Rubus genus, valued for both ornamental and culinary purposes."
