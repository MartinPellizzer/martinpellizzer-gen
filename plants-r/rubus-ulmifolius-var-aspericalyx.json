    "intro": "Rubus ulmifolius var. aspericalyx, commonly known as the rough-leaved blackberry, is a shrub native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The leaves are typically dark green and have a rough texture due to the presence of fine hairs. It produces small white flowers in the spring, which are followed by edible blackberries in the summer. This plant is often found in woodlands, hedgerows, and disturbed soils, and it plays a role in supporting local wildlife."
