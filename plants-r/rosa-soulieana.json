    "intro": "Rosa soulieana, commonly known as the Chinese tea rose, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rosaceae. It is native to China and is characterized by its fragrant, semi-double pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows as a shrub, reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters, with thorny stems and dark green, serrated leaves. Its flowers are often used in horticulture for their ornamental value and are also appreciated for their subtle, tea-like scent. Rosa soulieana is relatively disease-resistant and thrives in well-drained soil with full sun exposure."
