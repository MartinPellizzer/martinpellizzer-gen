    "intro": "Rhamnus sinensis, commonly known as the Chinese buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and alternate, simple, elliptical leaves that are glossy on top and pale underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by dark purple berries that are rich in anthraquinone compounds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas or along riverbanks. Due to its medicinal properties, it has been used in traditional Chinese medicine for centuries."
