    "intro": "Rosa jundzillii var. pilosula, commonly known as the silky rose, is a rare and ornamental shrub native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its dense, silvery-gray foliage covered in fine, soft hairs, which give it a distinctive and almost velvety appearance. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late summer, adding visual interest to its already striking foliage. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its rarity and unique appearance, it is highly valued in botanical gardens and by plant enthusiasts."
