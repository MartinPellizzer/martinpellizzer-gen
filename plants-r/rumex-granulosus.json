    "intro": "Rumex granulosus, commonly known as the rough dock, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features broad, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive rough texture and a waxy coating. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are borne on erect, branched stems. Its roots are fibrous and can form dense colonies, making it a common weed in disturbed soils. Rumex granulosus is often found in grasslands, roadsides, and along riverbanks, where it thrives in moist, fertile environments."
