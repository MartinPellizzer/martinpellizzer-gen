It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or along riverbanks. Due to its hardy nature, it is relatively easy to cultivate in gardens with minimal care."
