    "intro": "Ricinocarpus neocaledonicus, commonly known as the New Caledonian ricinocarp, is a rare flowering plant native to the island of New Caledonia. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its woody stem and palm-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. Its unique morphology and restricted distribution make it a subject of interest in botanical research. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
