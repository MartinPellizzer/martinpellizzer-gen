    "intro": "Rubus crataegifolius f. flavescens, commonly known as the yellow-leaved bramble, is a variant of the bramble family with distinctive botanical features. It is characterized by its yellowish foliage, which sets it apart from the typical green leaves of other Rubus species. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are generally red or black when mature. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils. Its morphology includes thorny stems and serrated leaves, typical of many Rubus species."
