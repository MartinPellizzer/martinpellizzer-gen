    "intro": "Rubus khekii, commonly known as the Kekii blackberry, is a species of bramble native to China. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its thorny stems and aggregate fruits. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically consumed fresh or used in jams. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forested areas with well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and less-studied species within the Rubus genus."
