    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 rhamnifolius, commonly known as the blackberry raspberry, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Rubus fruticosus (blackberry) and Rubus ideaus (raspberry). It is a thorny shrub that typically grows in temperate regions, often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or black when mature, with a tart flavor. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it has a complex root system that helps stabilize soil. This hybrid is valued for its ornamental qualities and edible fruits, though it can be invasive in certain environments."
