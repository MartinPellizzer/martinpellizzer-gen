    "intro": "Rauvolfia spathulata, commonly known as the Indian snakeroot, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Pacific. It is a climbing shrub that typically grows up to 3 meters in height, featuring heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant is notable for its medicinal properties, particularly the presence of reserpine, a compound used in the treatment of hypertension. Its roots and leaves are often harvested for traditional and modern pharmaceutical applications. Rauvolfia spathulata thrives in humid, shaded environments and is commonly found in forest understories."
