It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and clusters of fragrant pink flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal and rocky environments, showing a high degree of hardiness. Its leaves are covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological significance in its native range."
