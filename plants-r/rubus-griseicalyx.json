    "intro": "Rubus griseicalyx, commonly known as the gray-leaved blackberry, is a species of brambles native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves that are often covered in a fine, grayish pubescence. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black in color. It thrives in moist, woodland habitats and is often found in the understory of temperate forests. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and agroforestry systems."
