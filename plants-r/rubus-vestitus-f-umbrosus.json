    "intro": "Rubus vestitus f. umbrosus, commonly known as the shadowy raspberry, is a botanical variant of the raspberry plant characterized by its dark, almost black foliage. This plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories, where it thrives in low light conditions. Its leaves are densely hairy, providing a velvety texture and aiding in moisture retention. The flowers are usually pale pink or white, and the fruits, while smaller than typical raspberries, are often more intensely flavored. This subspecies is of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its unique adaptations to shaded habitats."
