    "intro": "Rhus glaucovirens, commonly known as the silverleaf sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically gray-green in color due to a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by red, fuzzy berries that are a food source for birds and small mammals. Its adaptability to arid conditions makes it a common sight in desert and rocky landscapes. The plant's botanical features make it an important component of its native ecosystem."
