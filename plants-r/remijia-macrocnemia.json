It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that often display vibrant colors. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps retain moisture.
