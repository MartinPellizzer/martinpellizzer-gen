    "intro": "Rumex \u00d7 similatus, commonly known as the hybrid sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Polygonaceae family and is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves with a distinctive reddish or purple coloration on the veins. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on slender, erect stalks. Its rhubarb-like leaves are edible but contain oxalic acid, making them potentially toxic if consumed in large quantities. The plant is often found in moist, disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of habitats, including gardens and woodland edges."
