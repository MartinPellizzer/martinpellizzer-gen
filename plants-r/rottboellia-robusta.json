    "intro": "Rottboellia robusta, commonly known as the panic grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in open areas, roadsides, and agricultural fields. Rottboellia robusta is adapted to warm climates and is sometimes considered a weed in cultivated landscapes."
