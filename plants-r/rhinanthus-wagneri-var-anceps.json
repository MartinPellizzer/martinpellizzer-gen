It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, characterized by its parasitic nature and lack of chlorophyll. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and woodland clearings. Its small, hairy seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its distribution across suitable environments."
