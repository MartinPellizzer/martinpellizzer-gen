    "intro": "Ranunculus lanuginosus var. grandifolius, commonly known as the woolly buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features a basal rosette of soft, hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, white pubescence. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with five broadly ovate petals, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
