    "intro": "Rubus caesius var. stachyoides, commonly known as the purple-fruited raspberry, is a variant of the raspberry plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive deep purple to black berries, which are often smaller than those of common raspberries. The plant produces compound leaves with serrated edges and has thorny stems typical of the Rubus genus. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges and hedgerows. Its berries are not only ornamental but also used in culinary applications, though they are less commonly cultivated than other raspberry varieties."
