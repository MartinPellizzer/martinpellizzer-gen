    "intro": "Rubia palustris, commonly known as marsh bindweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It produces small, pale pink to white flowers that bloom from June to August, and its leaves are heart-shaped with a rough texture. The plant has a strong, creeping rhizome system that allows it to spread rapidly in moist environments. It is often found in marshes, ditches, and along the edges of ponds. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to the biodiversity of its ecosystem."
