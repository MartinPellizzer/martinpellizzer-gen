    "intro": "Rosa alpina var. aculeata, commonly known as the Alpine rose, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and clusters of fragrant, pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, thriving in well-drained, acidic soils. Its leaves are compound, with serrated edges, and the flowers are often borne on pedicels that are slightly hairy. This variety is valued for its ornamental beauty and hardiness in colder climates."
