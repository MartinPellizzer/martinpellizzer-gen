It is characterized by its compound leaves with serrated edges and small, red bracts that resemble flowers. The plant produces rose-like flowers that are typically pink or white, followed by bright orange or red hips in the fall. Its stems are covered in stiff, glandular hairs, giving them a rough texture. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
