    "intro": "Rhamnus baphicoccus, commonly known as the Tibetan buckthorn, is a shrub native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its small, oval leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by small, red berries in the summer. It is adapted to cold and arid environments, often growing at elevations above 3,000 meters. The plant has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its potential laxative properties."
