    "intro": "Romulea rosea var. rosea, commonly known as the rose bitterroot, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pale pink to deep rose. The plant is adapted to well-drained, rocky soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its bulbs are edible when young but contain toxic compounds that require careful preparation. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also valued in traditional herbal medicine."
