    "intro": "Rhaphiolepis umbellata subsp. liukiuensis, commonly known as the Ryukyu hoya, is a flowering shrub native to the Ryukyu Islands of Japan. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of fragrant, tubular flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in mountainous regions. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and the plant produces small, berry-like fruits that are edible but not commonly cultivated. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often used in horticulture for its compact growth and attractive appearance."
