It features delicate, showy flowers with five to eight petal-like sepals in shades of white, pink, or purple. The plant has a basal rosette of pinnately divided leaves, which are typically trifoliate or trisect, giving it its subspecies name. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as forest floors and stream banks. The flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
