    "intro": "Rapuntium pygmaeum, commonly known as the dwarf buttercup, is a small, herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows to a height of only a few centimeters, with smooth, waxy leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its botanical features include a short, thick rhizome and a cluster of small, rounded leaves at the base. The species is noted for its resilience to harsh climates and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptations to high-altitude environments."
