    "intro": "Rosa \u00d7 francofurtana, commonly known as the Frankfurt rose, is a hybrid rose species originating from Germany. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white. The plant is typically deciduous, shedding its leaves in the fall, and is well-suited for garden cultivation due to its hardiness and ornamental value. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. The Frankfurt rose is prized for its delicate appearance and is often used in landscaping and floral arrangements."
