It is characterized by its dark green, doubly serrated leaves that are often shorter and more rounded than those of its parent species. The plant produces fragrant, pale pink to white flowers with five petals, typically appearing in late spring to early summer. Its stems are thorny and covered in a dense layer of grayish-white hairs. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its beauty and historical significance."
