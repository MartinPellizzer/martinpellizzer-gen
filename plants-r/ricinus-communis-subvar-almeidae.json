    "intro": "Ricinus communis subvar. almeidae, commonly known as the Almeida's castor oil plant, is a variant of the castor oil plant native to tropical regions. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves and distinctive spiny seed capsules. The plant produces toxic seeds that contain ricin, a potent toxin, making it hazardous if ingested. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its oil-rich seeds. Despite its toxicity, it has been studied for potential medicinal and industrial applications."
