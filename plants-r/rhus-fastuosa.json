    "intro": "Rhus fastuosa, commonly known as the smooth sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged with 11 to 31 leaflets that turn vibrant red in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in upright clusters, followed by red, fuzzy fruits that persist through winter. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is adaptable to various soil types. Rhus fastuosa is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in disturbed soils."
