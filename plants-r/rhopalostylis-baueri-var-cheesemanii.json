    "intro": "Rhopalostylis baueri var. cheesemanii, commonly known as the Cheeseman's palm, is a rare and endemic species native to New Zealand. It is a member of the Arecaceae family and is characterized by its slender, unbranched trunk and pinnate leaves. The plant typically grows in coastal areas, where it thrives in sandy or rocky soils. It produces small, clustered inflorescences with yellowish flowers, followed by dark blue berries. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
