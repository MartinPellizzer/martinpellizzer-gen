It produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically harvested in late summer. The plant has trifoliate leaves with serrated edges and produces white to pale pink flowers in the spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands and along streambanks. The berries are edible but have a tart flavor, making them suitable for jams and pies."
