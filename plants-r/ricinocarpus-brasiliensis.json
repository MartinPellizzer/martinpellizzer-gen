    "intro": "Ricinocarpus brasiliensis, commonly known as the Brazilian ricin fruit, is a tropical plant native to South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its palm-like appearance with large, pinnate leaves. The plant produces distinctive, fleshy fruits that contain toxic seeds, which are a source of the potent toxin ricin. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its toxicity, it is not commonly cultivated but is of interest in botanical and pharmacological studies."
