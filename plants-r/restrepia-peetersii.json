    "intro": "Restrepia peetersii, commonly known as the Peeters' orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, pseudobulbous structure with fleshy leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, often blooming during the rainy season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, porous substrates for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and delicate species in the wild."
