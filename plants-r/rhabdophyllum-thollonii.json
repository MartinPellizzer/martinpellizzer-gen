    "intro": "Rhabdophyllum thollonii, commonly known as the Madagascar orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its striking, elongated flowers that often display vibrant colors such as red, orange, and yellow. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in the humid, tropical rainforests of its native habitat. Its botanical features include a slender stem with fleshy leaves and a distinctive inflorescence that can bear multiple blooms. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native environment."
