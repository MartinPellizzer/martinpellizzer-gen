    "intro": "Rhamnus frangula var. saxatilis, commonly known as the saxatile buckthorn, is a shrub native to rocky and arid regions of Europe. It is characterized by its small, oval leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces dark blue berries that are edible for birds. The plant is adapted to poor soils and can thrive in harsh environments due to its deep root system. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing structural support in its rugged habitat. This variety is less commonly cultivated than the typical form of Rhamnus frangula but is valued for its ecological role in supporting wildlife."
