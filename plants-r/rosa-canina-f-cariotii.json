    "intro": "Rosa canina f. cariotii, commonly known as the Cariotti's dog rose, is a botanical variant of the common dog rose. It is characterized by its distinctive, semi-woody stems and dense, thorny growth habit. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers in early summer, which are followed by orange-red hips. It is native to southern Europe and is often found in hedgerows and woodland edges. This form is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in horticulture."
