    "intro": "Rhodopis, commonly known as the red sanders, is a rare and valuable tree species native to southern India. It belongs to the family Fabaceae and is characterized by its distinctive reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly sought after in the furniture and carving industries. The plant has compound leaves with trifoliate leaves and produces small, yellowish-white flowers. It thrives in dry, tropical climates and is often found in dry deciduous forests. Due to overexploitation, it is now listed as an endangered species, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
