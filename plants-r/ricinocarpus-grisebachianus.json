    "intro": "Ricinocarpus grisebachianus, commonly known as the green mangrove, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments. It belongs to the family Rhizophoraceae and is characterized by its aerial roots, which help in stabilizing the soil and facilitating gas exchange. The plant has thick, waxy leaves that reduce water loss in coastal areas. It produces small, clustered flowers followed by woody fruits containing seeds. Ricinocarpus grisebachianus plays a crucial role in coastal ecosystems by preventing erosion and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species."
