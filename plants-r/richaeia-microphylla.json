    "intro": "Richaeia microphylla, commonly known as the dwarf mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that primarily grows on the branches of coniferous trees. It lacks true roots and instead absorbs nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, white or pale green berries that are toxic to most animals but serve as a food source for certain birds. Its life cycle involves a complex relationship with its host, where it relies on the host for survival and reproduction. Richaeia microphylla is often found in temperate and boreal forests, where its host trees provide the necessary conditions for its growth."
