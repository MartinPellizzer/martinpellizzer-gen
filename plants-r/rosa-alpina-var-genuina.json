It features narrow, leathery leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of white to silver-gray hairs. The plant produces fragrant, pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in alpine gardens."
