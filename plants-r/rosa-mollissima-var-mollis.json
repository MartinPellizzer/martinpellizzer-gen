    "intro": "Rosa mollissima var. mollis, commonly known as the soft-hairy rose, is a species native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its soft, fuzzy leaves and stems, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces fragrant pink to red flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping in arid regions."
