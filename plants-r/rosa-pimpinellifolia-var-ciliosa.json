    "intro": "Rosa pimpinellifolia var. ciliosa, commonly known as the hairy rock rose, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in spring. The plant has a compact growth habit with hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
