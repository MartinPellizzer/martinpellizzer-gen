    "intro": "Rosa \u00d7 dumetorum f. chapusii, commonly known as the chapman's rose, is a compact, shrub-like plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has dense, thorny stems and dark green, serrated leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of fuzzy hairs. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in cooler climates. Its botanical characteristics make it well-suited for rock gardens and as a border plant in woodland settings."
