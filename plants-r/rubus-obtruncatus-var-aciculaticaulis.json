    "intro": "Rubus obtruncatus var. aciculaticaulis, commonly known as the slender-stemmed blackberry, is a shrub characterized by its slender, often spiny stems and small, trifoliate leaves. It produces aggregate fruits composed of tiny, dark purple to black drupelets. The plant is native to regions of North America, particularly in the western United States. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland edges and stream banks. Its botanical features make it distinguishable from other Rubus species due to its unique stem structure and leaf morphology."
