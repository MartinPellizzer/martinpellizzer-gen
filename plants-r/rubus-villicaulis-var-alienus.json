    "intro": "Rubus villicaulis var. alienus, commonly known as the alien raspberry, is a variant of the brambles native to certain regions of Europe. It is characterized by its thorny stems and aggregate fruits that develop from multiple ovaries. The leaves are typically trifoliate, with serrated edges and a hairy surface. This plant thrives in disturbed soils and can often be found along roadsides or in woodland edges. Its botanical features make it adaptable to various environments, though it is less common than its parent species."
