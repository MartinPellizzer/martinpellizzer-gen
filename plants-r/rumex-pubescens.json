    "intro": "Rumex pubescens, commonly known as hairy sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Polygonaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, hairy pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on slender, erect stems. Native to temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its leaves are often used in traditional herbal medicine and as a culinary herb, though they contain oxalic acid and should be consumed in moderation."
