    "intro": "Rumex acetosa var. papillaris, commonly known as sheep's sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features alternate, heart-shaped leaves with a serrated margin and a distinctive reddish or purple coloration on the underside. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in dense clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in disturbed areas. Its leaves are edible but contain oxalic acid, which can be toxic in large quantities."
