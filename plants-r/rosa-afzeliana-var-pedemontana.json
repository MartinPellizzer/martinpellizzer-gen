    "intro": "Rosa afzeliana var. pedemontana, commonly known as the Pedemontana rose, is a shrub-like plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and clusters of small, fragrant pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets with serrated edges. This variety is well adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, often growing in alpine or subalpine environments. It is valued both for its ornamental qualities and its historical use in traditional herbal medicine."
