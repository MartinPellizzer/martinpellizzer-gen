    "intro": "Ruppia maritima var. exigua, commonly known as the dwarf seagrass, is a marine plant that thrives in coastal and brackish water environments. It is characterized by its small, ribbon-like leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in length. This variant is closely related to the common seagrass Ruppia maritima, but it exhibits distinct morphological differences. It forms dense underwater meadows that provide important habitat for various aquatic organisms. The plant is adapted to fluctuating salinity and temperature conditions, making it a resilient component of coastal ecosystems."
