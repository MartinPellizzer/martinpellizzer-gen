    "intro": "Rubus saltuum, commonly known as the alpine bramble, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant produces red or black berries that are edible but often have a tart flavor. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is often found in alpine meadows and forest edges."
