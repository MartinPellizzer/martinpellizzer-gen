    "intro": "Rosa canina subsp. catalaunica, commonly known as the Catalan rose, is a subspecies native to southern Europe, particularly Spain and parts of France. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1\u20132 meters, featuring thorny stems and pinnate leaves with five to seven leaflets. The plant produces clusters of fragrant pink to red flowers in the spring, followed by orange-red hip fruits that are rich in vitamin C.
