    "intro": "Rhodax viscaria, commonly known as the sticky rhododendron, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and showy, clustered flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces sticky resinous substances, which can attract specific insects and deter herbivores. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous regions. Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and a subject of interest in horticulture."
