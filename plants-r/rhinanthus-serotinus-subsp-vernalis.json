    "intro": "Rhinanthus serotinus subsp. vernalis, commonly known as the early yellow-rattle, is a flowering plant native to Europe. It is a hemiparasitic species that attaches to the roots of grasses and other plants, drawing nutrients from them. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. It thrives in open, disturbed habitats such as grasslands and heaths. Its subspecies status reflects its distinct ecological and morphological characteristics compared to other rhinanthus species."
