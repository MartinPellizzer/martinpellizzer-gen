    "intro": "Rubus sordidus, commonly known as the dirty raspberry, is a species of bramble native to parts of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its thorny stems and small, usually pale or reddish flowers. The plant produces berries that are typically small and less palatable compared to other raspberry varieties. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the plant thrives in moist, shaded environments. Due to its rugged appearance and limited culinary use, it is more valued for its ecological role than for human consumption."
