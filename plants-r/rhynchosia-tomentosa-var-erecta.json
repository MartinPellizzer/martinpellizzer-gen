    "intro": "Rhynchosia tomentosa var. erecta, commonly known as the woolly cowpea, is a tropical legume characterized by its hairy, erect growth habit and compound leaves. It produces small, yellow flowers that give way to elongated, cylindrical pods containing edible seeds. The plant is native to regions of Africa and is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. It is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in agricultural settings. The varietal form 'erecta' distinguishes it from other varieties by its upright growth pattern and dense foliage."
