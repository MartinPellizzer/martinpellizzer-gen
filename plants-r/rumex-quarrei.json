    "intro": "Rumex quarrei, commonly known as the narrowleaf dock, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in wet meadows, stream banks, and other damp habitats. The plant has alternate, lance-shaped leaves with a prominent midrib and a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in dense, terminal spikes, and it produces oval, three-angled fruits. Rumex quarrei is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used historically in traditional medicine."
