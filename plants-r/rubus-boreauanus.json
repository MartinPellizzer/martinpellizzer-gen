It is characterized by its prickly stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are rich in antioxidants. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in alpine and subarctic environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
