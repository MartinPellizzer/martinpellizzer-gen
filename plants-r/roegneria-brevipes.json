    "intro": "Roegneria brevipes, commonly known as the short-stemmed wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and short, stiff stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue and a hairy texture. Roegneria brevipes is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is valued for its ability to stabilize soil in arid environments."
