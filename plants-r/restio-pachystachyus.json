It belongs to the Restionaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and dense clusters of small, spike-like flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and sandy soils, thriving in well-drained conditions. It produces long, narrow leaves that are often used in traditional basket weaving. The tall restio is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize coastal dunes."
