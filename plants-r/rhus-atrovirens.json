    "intro": "Rhus atrovirens, commonly known as the blackleaf smoothsumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically pinnately arranged with serrated margins. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in panicles, followed by fuzzy, orange-red berries that are a key feature of its botanical appearance. Its leaves turn bright red in the fall, adding ornamental value. The plant is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in woodland edges and open woods."
