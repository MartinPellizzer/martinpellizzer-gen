    "intro": "Ranunculus pusillus var. denticulatus, commonly known as the toothed lesser buttercup, is a small, herbaceous perennial native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features delicate, palmate leaves with finely toothed margins and bright yellow, five-petaled flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. Its flowers are short-lived, lasting only a few days, and it is often pollinated by bees and other early spring insects. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
