It features small, dark green leaves that turn reddish in the fall, and it produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring. The plant is characterized by its smooth, dark red bark and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. Rhus florita is also valued for its ability to provide habitat and food for wildlife."
