    "intro": "Rhus succedanea var. discolor, commonly known as the smooth sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically pinnately arranged with 11 to 31 leaflets that turn vibrant red in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clustered inflorescences, followed by bright red, fuzzy berries that are a food source for birds. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is adaptable to various soil types, making it a resilient species in woodland and disturbed areas. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its seasonal color changes and distinctive foliage."
