    "intro": "Rubus fruticosus var. praecox, commonly known as early blackberry bramble, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems, trifoliate leaves, and clusters of small white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces edible blackberries in late summer, which are rich in antioxidants and have a tart flavor. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, loamy soils. This species is often found in hedgerows, woodlands, and along riverbanks."
