    "intro": "Rhus veatchiana, commonly known as the Veatch's sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically arranged in pairs along the stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by red, fuzzy berries that are a food source for birds and small mammals. Rhus veatchiana thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and streamside habitats. Its botanical features make it an important component of local ecosystems and a subject of interest in botanical studies."
