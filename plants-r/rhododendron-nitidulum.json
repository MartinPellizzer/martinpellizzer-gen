    "intro": "Rhododendron nitidulum, commonly known as the smoothleaf azalea, is a species native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia, including China and Japan. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters, featuring dense, leathery leaves that are smooth and glossy on both sides. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is often cultivated in horticultural settings."
