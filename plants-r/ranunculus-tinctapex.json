    "intro": "Ranunculus tinctapex, commonly known as the violetleaf buttercup, is a species of flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant has a basal rosette of leaves that are deeply lobed and often covered in fine hairs. Its leaves and flowers are typically covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Ranunculus tinctapex is a herbaceous perennial that thrives in well-drained soils and full sun."
