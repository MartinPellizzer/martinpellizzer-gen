    "intro": "Rockhausenia nubigena, commonly known as the cloud mist orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, hairy leaves and small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in the cool, moist air of mountainous environments. The plant thrives in shaded, humid conditions, often growing on rocky substrates or among moss-covered cliffs. Its unique morphology and habitat make it a subject of interest for botanists studying alpine flora. Due to its restricted distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, Rockhausenia nubigena is considered a vulnerable species."
