    "intro": "Rumex \u00d7 ambigens, commonly known as the hybrid sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant resulting from the cross between Rumex acetosa (common sorrel) and Rumex acetobursa (southern sorrel). It is characterized by its distinctive arrow-shaped leaves with a reddish or purple coloration on the veins, which are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are borne on erect, branched inflorescences. Rumex \u00d7 ambigens is often found in moist, disturbed soils in woodland edges and meadows, and it is known for its edible leaves, though they are tart and acidic. Its hybrid nature makes it a subject of interest in botanical studies and horticulture."
