    "intro": "Rhododendron ririei subsp. leiboense, commonly known as the Leibo rhododendron, is a rare and endemic species native to the high-altitude regions of western China. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and showy, bell-shaped flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink to purple. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained acidic soils, often found in mountainous forests. Its botanical features include thick, leathery leaves and a compact growth habit. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
