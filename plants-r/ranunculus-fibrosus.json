    "intro": "Ranunculus fibrosus, commonly known as the fibrous buttercup, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is a perennial herb characterized by its hairy stems and basal leaves that are deeply lobed. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
