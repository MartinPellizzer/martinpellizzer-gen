    "intro": "Rotheca suffruticosa, commonly known as the silverleaf rotheca, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale blue or purple, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along dry streambeds. Rotheca suffruticosa is drought-tolerant and has a slow growth rate, making it a hardy plant suited for xeriscaping."
