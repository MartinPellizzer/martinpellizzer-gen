    "intro": "Rhamnus crenata var. parvifolia, commonly known as the dwarf buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring dense, thorny branches and small, oval-shaped leaves that are often slightly notched. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by small, dark blue berries that are an important food source for birds. Its foliage provides habitat for various insects, making it ecologically significant in woodland and shrubland ecosystems."
