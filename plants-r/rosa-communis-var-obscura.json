    "intro": "Rosa communis var. obscura, commonly known as the dark rose, is a less common variant of the common rose. It is characterized by its deep, almost black petals that darken as they age, giving it a striking appearance. The plant produces fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, though it can tolerate partial shade. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for small garden spaces or container gardening."
