    "intro": "Rumicastrum calyptratum, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and its production of small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its seeds are enclosed in follicles that split open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. The plant plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and is adapted to thrive in poor, sandy soils."
