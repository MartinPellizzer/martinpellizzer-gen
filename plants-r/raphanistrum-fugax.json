    "intro": "Raphanistrum fugax, commonly known as the common cocklebur, is a flowering plant in the sunflower family (Asteraceae). It is an annual herb that typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields. The plant features lobed leaves and produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into spiny, spherical fruits. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and the plant is often considered a weed in agricultural settings. Raphanistrum fugax is native to Europe but has been naturalized in many parts of the world."
