    "intro": "Ranunculus monophyllus f. latisectus, commonly known as the broad-leaf buttercup, is a variant of the narrow-leaf buttercup characterized by its distinctly lobed and broad leaves. This plant is native to parts of Europe and Asia, typically found in moist, woodland habitats. Its flowers are usually yellow with five petals, and it blooms in early spring. The foliage is notable for its intricate, palmate leaf structure, which distinguishes it from other ranunculus species. It is an herbaceous perennial that thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil."
