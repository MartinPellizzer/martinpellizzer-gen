    "intro": "Rubus acutifrons, commonly known as the sharp-fruited blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the western United States. It belongs to the genus Rubus in the family Rosaceae, characterized by its thorny stems and aggregate fruits. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically edible, though they are often overshadowed by more commercially popular blackberry varieties. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and its flowers are white with five petals. Rubus acutifrons thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and mountainous regions."
