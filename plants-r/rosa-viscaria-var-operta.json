    "intro": "Rosa viscaria var. operta, commonly known as the operta rose, is a compact, shrub-like species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features dense, thorny stems and small, dark green leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, semi-double pink flowers that bloom in early summer. It is well adapted to harsh, alpine environments and thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
