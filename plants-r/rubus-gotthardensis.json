    "intro": "Rubus gotthardensis, commonly known as the Gotthard bramble, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is native to the Alps and is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in late spring, which are followed by edible, red berries. It thrives in rocky and mountainous habitats, often growing in open areas with well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and protected species in certain regions."
