    "intro": "Rourea glabra var. coriacea, commonly known as the rough-leaf rourea, is a shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are covered in a fine, waxy coating, giving them a rough texture. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its bark is smooth and often has a reddish or brownish hue, and it is sometimes used in traditional medicine. The species is adapted to grow in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or arid environments."
