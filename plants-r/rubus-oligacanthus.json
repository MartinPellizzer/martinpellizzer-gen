    "intro": "Rubus oligacanthus, commonly known as the small-fruited blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the western United States. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically less than 1 cm in diameter. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils. Due to its small size and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
