    "intro": "Rhus galeottii, commonly known as the staghorn sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes rough and furrowed with age, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, fuzzy berries that persist into winter. Its leaves are compound, with three to five leaflets that are serrated and turn bright red in the fall. Rhus galeottii is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in woodland edges, thickets, and disturbed areas."
