    "intro": "Rubus rosanthus var. salsus, commonly known as the coastal raspberry, is a shrub native to coastal regions of the Pacific Northwest. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and hairy stems, which help it withstand salty air and wind. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or yellow, often used in local foraging. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. It plays an important ecological role by providing food for wildlife and stabilizing coastal dunes."
