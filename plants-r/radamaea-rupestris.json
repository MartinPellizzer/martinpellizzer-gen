    "intro": "Radamaea rupestris, commonly known as the rock dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows on rocky outcrops and well-drained soils. The plant features a basal rosette of fleshy, blue-green leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. Its flowers are small, yellow, and dandelion-like, appearing in spring. Radamaea rupestris is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
