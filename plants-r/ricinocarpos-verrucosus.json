    "intro": "Ricinocarpos verrucosus, commonly known as the rough-hair lichen, is a member of the family Verrucariaceae. It is a crustose lichen that typically grows on bark, stone, or soil in temperate and tropical regions. The thallus is covered with small, rounded tubercles, giving it a distinctive, rough texture. It contains various secondary metabolites, including usnic acid and atranorin, which contribute to its chemical defense against herbivores. This lichen is often used in ecological studies to monitor air quality due to its sensitivity to environmental pollutants."
