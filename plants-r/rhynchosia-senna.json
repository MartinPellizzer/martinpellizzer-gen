It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and yellow-orange flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces elongated pods containing kidney-shaped seeds, which are often used in traditional medicine. Rhynchosia senna is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it useful in agricultural systems. However, the plant contains toxic compounds, requiring caution in its use."
