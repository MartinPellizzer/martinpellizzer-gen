    "intro": "Robinsonia longifolia, commonly known as the long-leaved robinsonia, is a rare and striking member of the Acanthaceae family. It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces striking clusters of tubular, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Native to the humid forests of Southeast Asia, it thrives in shaded, moist environments. Due to its rarity and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
