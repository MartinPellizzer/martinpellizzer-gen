    "intro": "Rosa canina f. globosa, commonly known as the globular dog rose, is a subspecies of the common dog rose. It is characterized by its compact, rounded growth habit and small, pinkish-red flowers. The plant produces hips, which are the fruit, and these are often used in traditional herbal remedies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for garden cultivation. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its persistent, showy fruiting bodies."
