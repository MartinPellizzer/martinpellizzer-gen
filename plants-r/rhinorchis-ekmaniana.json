    "intro": "Rhinorchis ekmaniana, commonly known as the Ekman's rhinorchis, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring a distinctive rhinoceros-like horn-shaped spur. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on rocky substrates or in forest understories. Its flowers are usually small and delicate, displaying a range of colors from pale yellow to orange. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Rhinorchis ekmaniana is considered a species of conservation concern."
