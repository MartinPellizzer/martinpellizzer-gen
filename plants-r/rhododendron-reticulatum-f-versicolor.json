    "intro": "Rhododendron reticulatum f. versicolor, commonly known as the variable rhododendron, is a hybrid form of the species Rhododendron reticulatum. It is characterized by its striking variation in flower color, ranging from white to pink and even red, depending on environmental conditions. The plant is a shrub with dense, leathery foliage that provides a lush backdrop to its showy blooms. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to produce clusters of fragrant flowers in late spring to early summer."
