It features delicate, yellow flowers with 5-7 sepals and 5-7 petals, typical of the Ranunculaceae family. The plant has a short, stout stem that often lies prostrate or is erect, depending on the habitat. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a distinctive lobed structure that aids in photosynthesis in sunny environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal areas or disturbed sites."
