    "intro": "Rhus flexuosa, commonly known as the smooth sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and turn bright red in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in panicles, followed by orange-red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds. Rhus flexuosa thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in open woods, fields, and along stream banks. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a common component of disturbed habitats."
