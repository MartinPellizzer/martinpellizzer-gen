    "intro": "Resinanthus albobruneus, commonly known as the white-bark resin tree, is a unique plant characterized by its distinctive white and brown bark that peels in thin, papery layers. It is native to specific regions in Southeast Asia, where it thrives in humid, tropical climates. The plant produces a valuable resin that has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a natural adhesive. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and have a glossy texture, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
