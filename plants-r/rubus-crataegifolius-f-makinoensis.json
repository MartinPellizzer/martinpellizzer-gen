    "intro": "Rubus crataegifolius f. makinoensis, commonly known as the Makino's bramble, is a botanical variant of the bramble family (Rosaceae). It is characterized by its distinctive leaves, which resemble those of hawthorn (Crataegus), giving it its specific epithet. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in temperate forest regions of East Asia. Its flowers are small and white, producing clusters of red, juicy berries that are edible but often tart. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
