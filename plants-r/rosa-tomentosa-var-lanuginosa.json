The plant produces fragrant pink or white flowers in spring, which are borne on long, slender pedicels. Its leaves are typically oval and have a soft, hairy texture, contributing to its overall thick, velvety look. Rosa tomentosa var. lanuginosa is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its unique appearance and hardy nature."
