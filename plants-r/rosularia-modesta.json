    "intro": "Rosularia modesta, commonly known as the modest rosebush, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid regions of Central Asia. It features a compact rosette of fleshy, gray-green leaves that are covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers in early summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its succulent foliage makes it well adapted to harsh, dry environments. Rosularia modesta is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its attractive appearance and drought tolerance."
