    "intro": "Ruehssia fruticosa, commonly known as the creeping rosemary or coastal rosemary, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its aromatic, needle-like leaves and small, pale blue to purple flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and full sun, making it well-suited for coastal gardens. Its leaves contain essential oils that contribute to its distinctive fragrance and have been used in traditional medicine. Ruehssia fruticosa is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in sandy environments."
