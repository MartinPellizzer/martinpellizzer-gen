    "intro": "Rhipsalis tetragona, commonly known as the four-cornered mistletoe, is a species of epiphytic cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems that often grow in a cascading manner. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers, typically blooming in the summer months. Its fruit is a small, fleshy berry that contains seeds covered in a sticky substance to aid in seed dispersal. Rhipsalis tetragona is well adapted to humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees in tropical rainforests."
