It features dark green, oval-shaped leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring. The plant is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and thornless stems. Its fruit is a small, black drupe that ripens in late summer. It is often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils, and it has been introduced to North America as an invasive species."
