It is a shrub with thorny stems and compound leaves, typically found in temperate regions. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are usually red or black in color, depending on the variety. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands or along streams. The fruit is edible, though some varieties may have a tart or sharp flavor."
