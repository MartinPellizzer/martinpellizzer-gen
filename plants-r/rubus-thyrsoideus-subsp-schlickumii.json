It produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically harvested in the fall. The plant has compound leaves with serrated edges and thorny stems, typical of many Rubus species. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial shade, often found in forested areas. The berries are not only edible but also have historical uses in traditional medicine."
