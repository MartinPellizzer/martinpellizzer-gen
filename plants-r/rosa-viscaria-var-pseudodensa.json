    "intro": "Rosa viscaria var. pseudodensa, commonly known as the dense-stemmed rose, is a variant of the shrub rose characterized by its dense, thorny stems and clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters and produces rose hips that are rich in vitamin C. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and hardiness. The leaves are pinnately compound, with serrated leaflets that provide a lush, green backdrop to its showy blooms."
