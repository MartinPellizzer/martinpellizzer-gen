    "intro": "Rosa \u00d7 collina var. platyphylla, commonly known as the flat-leaf rock rose, is a hybrid rose species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its low-growing, spreading habit and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink to white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are broad and flat, which distinguishes it from other rose varieties. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
