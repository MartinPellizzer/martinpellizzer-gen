    "intro": "Rosa tomentosa f. baldensis, commonly known as the Baldensian shrub rose, is a compact, deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly gray foliage and clusters of fragrant, pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is well adapted to harsh, alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. Its hirsute leaves and robust stems make it a distinctive addition to rock gardens or alpine displays. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in challenging climates."
