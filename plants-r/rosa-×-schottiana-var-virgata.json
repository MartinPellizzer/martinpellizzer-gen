    "intro": "Rosa \u00d7 schottiana var. virgata, commonly known as the white everblooming rose, is a hybrid shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, thornless stems and profuse flowering habit, producing clusters of white, single blooms throughout the growing season. The plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained, fertile soil for optimal growth. Its compact size and continuous flowering make it a popular choice for garden borders and container planting. It is also valued for its resistance to common rose diseases and its ability to attract pollinators."
