    "intro": "Reseda villosa var. garamantum, commonly known as the Garamantian reseda, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of North Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, pale yellow to greenish flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant thrives in well-drained sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to hot, dry climates. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and historical use in dye production."
