    "intro": "Rumex dentatus, commonly known as the serrated sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features upright, branching stems that are often reddish in color, and its leaves are characterized by their serrated edges and a distinctive sour taste due to high oxalic acid content. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are typically borne on tall, slender stalks. Rumex dentatus thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. It is often used in traditional medicine and as a culinary herb, though its high oxalic acid content makes it potentially toxic in large quantities."
