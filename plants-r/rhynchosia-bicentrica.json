It features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces yellow flowers with distinctive, spurred petals. The plant bears pods that contain several kidney-shaped seeds, which are often used in traditional medicine. Rhynchosia bicentrica is notable for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, making it beneficial for soil fertility. Its botanical characteristics make it an important species in ecological and agricultural contexts."
