    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 falsus, commonly known as the false blackberry, is a hybrid plant within the Rubus genus. It is characterized by its thorny stems and aggregate fruits that resemble blackberries. The plant typically grows in temperate regions and thrives in well-drained soils. Its leaves are usually trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it produces small white or pink flowers in the spring. While not widely cultivated, it is occasionally found in wild areas and can be challenging to distinguish from other Rubus species."
