    "intro": "Richetia multiflora, commonly known as the swamp mallow, is a perennial herb native to wetland environments in the southeastern United States. It features a robust, creeping rhizome system that allows it to spread and colonize moist soils effectively. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine, soft hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Richetia multiflora plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various insects and small aquatic organisms."
