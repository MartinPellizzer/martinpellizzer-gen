    "intro": "Rheedia madruno subsp. ovata, commonly known as the ovate rheedia, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its lanceolate, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its fruits are follicles that release seeds with tufts of hair, aiding in wind dispersal. This species thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to temperate climates with cold winters."
