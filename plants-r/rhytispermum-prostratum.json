    "intro": "Rhytispermum prostratum, commonly known as the prostrate rhytispermum, is a low-growing perennial herb native to specific regions of southern Africa. It features a sprawling, mat-forming growth habit with thin, wiry stems that lie close to the ground. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, arranged in clusters along the stems. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant characteristics. Rhytispermum prostratum is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils with minimal water availability."
