    "intro": "Ricinus armatus, commonly known as the armed castor, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its spiny, palmate leaves and distinctive yellow-orange flowers. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain toxic, oily seeds, which are a key feature of its botanical profile. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, adapting well to poor soil conditions. Due to its defensive spines and toxic properties, it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
