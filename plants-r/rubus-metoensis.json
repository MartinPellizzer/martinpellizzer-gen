It is characterized by its prickly stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or black when mature. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
