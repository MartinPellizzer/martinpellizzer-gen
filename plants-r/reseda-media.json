    "intro": "Reseda media, commonly known as common reseda, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with slender stems and alternate leaves that are lance-shaped and often hairy. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom from June to August. Its flowers are followed by small, oblong seed pods that split open to release the seeds. Reseda media is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in fields, and it is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
