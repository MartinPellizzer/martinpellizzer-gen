    "intro": "Rhipsalis teres f. prismatica, commonly known as the prismatocactus, is a unique epiphytic cactus native to Brazil. It is characterized by its cylindrical, segmented stems that grow in a compact, upright form. The plant features small, white flowers that bloom in winter, adding ornamental value. Its leaves are reduced to tubercles, and it thrives in bright, indirect light with well-draining soil. It is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its low maintenance and distinctive appearance."
