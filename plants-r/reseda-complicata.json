    "intro": "Reseda complicata, commonly known as the velvetleaf or tangleleaf, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, ovate leaves and small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and thrives in sunny, open habitats. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution. Reseda complicata is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and adaptability."
