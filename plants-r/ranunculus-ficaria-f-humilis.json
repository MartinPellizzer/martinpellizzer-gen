    "intro": "Ranunculus ficaria f. humilis, commonly known as the lesser celandine, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features bright yellow, cup-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has heart-shaped, smooth, and often hairy leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in length. It thrives in moist, shady woodland areas and is often found in rich, loamy soils. Its botanical name reflects its close relation to the genus Ranunculus, which includes many other buttercup species."
