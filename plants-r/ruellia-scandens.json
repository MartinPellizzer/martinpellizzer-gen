    "intro": "Ruellia scandens, commonly known as blue mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a vigorous, semi-evergreen vine that can grow up to 15 feet in length. The plant features opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its showy, blue-violet flowers bloom in clusters during the summer months. Ruellia scandens is well-suited for use in trellises, as a ground cover, or in hanging baskets due to its trailing growth habit."
