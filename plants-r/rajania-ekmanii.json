    "intro": "Rajania ekmanii, commonly known as the Ekman's rajania, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the high-altitude regions of Ethiopia. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae, which includes many ornamental and ecologically significant species. The plant is characterized by its striking, elongated leaves and showy, tubular flowers that bloom in shades of violet and white. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas at elevations above 2,000 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Rajania ekmanii is considered a species of conservation concern."
