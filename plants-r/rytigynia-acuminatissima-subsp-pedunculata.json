    "intro": "Rytigynia acuminatissima subsp. pedunculata, commonly known as the slender-leaved rytigynia, is a shrub native to the rainforests of northern Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which bloom during the wet season. Its fruits are small, woody capsules that contain several seeds. This species is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution within its habitat."
