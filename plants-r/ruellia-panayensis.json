It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and clusters of tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories. Its flowers are usually blue or violet in color, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ruellia panayensis is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
