    "intro": "Rhodiola megalophylla, commonly known as the large-leaf rhodiola, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its upright stems and dense clusters of small, pink to reddish flowers. The plant has fleshy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its arid environment. Rhodiola megalophylla is adapted to high altitudes and cold climates, making it a hardy species found in alpine meadows. Its medicinal properties have been studied for their potential adaptogenic and antioxidant effects."
