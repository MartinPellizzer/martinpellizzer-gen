    "intro": "Ranunculus fallax subsp. erythrogonius, commonly known as the red-lobed buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It features delicate, palmately lobed leaves and showy, yellow flowers with prominent, red-tinged sepals. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in woodland or meadow habitats. It blooms from late spring to early summer, producing small, clustered flowers that attract pollinators. Due to its ornamental value and habitat specificity, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens but is considered rare in the wild."
