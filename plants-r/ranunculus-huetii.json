    "intro": "Ranunculus huetii, commonly known as the Huet's buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family, characterized by its showy, often brightly colored flowers. The plant features palmate leaves divided into five to nine lobes, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Its flowers typically have five sepals and numerous stamens, with a central pistil that is often yellow or orange in color. Ranunculus huetii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate, cup-shaped blooms."
