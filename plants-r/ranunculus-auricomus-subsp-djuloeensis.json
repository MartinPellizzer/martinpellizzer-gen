    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus subsp. djuloeensis, commonly known as the Djuloe buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the high-altitude regions of Ethiopia. It is characterized by its bright yellow, cup-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has simple, trifoliate leaves with serrated edges, and its stems are hairy and often branched. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is typically found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native range."
