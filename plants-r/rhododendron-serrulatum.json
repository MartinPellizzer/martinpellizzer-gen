    "intro": "Rhododendron serrulatum, commonly known as the serrated rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. The leaves are typically leathery and have serrated edges, giving the plant its scientific name. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticultural landscapes for its vibrant floral display."
