    "intro": "Rosa glauca var. submicrocarpa, commonly known as the dwarf glaucous rose, is a compact shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features narrow, dark green leaves with a slightly hairy underside, and its flowers are typically pale pink to white, with five petals. The plant produces small, rounded hips that are often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens and alpine displays. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
