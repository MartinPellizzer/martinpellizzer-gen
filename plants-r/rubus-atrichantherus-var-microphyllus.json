    "intro": "Rubus atrichantherus var. microphyllus, commonly known as the small-leaf blackberry, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its thornless stems and small, elliptical leaves with a smooth, dark green upper surface. The plant produces aggregate fruits composed of tiny, dark purple to black drupes that are typically less than 5 mm in diameter. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and thickets. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its edible, though small, berries."
