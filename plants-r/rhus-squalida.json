    "intro": "Rhus squalida, commonly known as the Chinese buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It belongs to the Anacardiaceae family, which includes plants like the mango and poison ivy. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically pinnate with 5 to 9 leaflets. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. Rhus squalida is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
