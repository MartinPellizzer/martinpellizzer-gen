    "intro": "Romulea celsii, commonly known as the golden rock orchid, is a striking plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that resemble orchids, hence its common name. The plant produces a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and blooms in spring, often in rocky or sandy soils. Its flowers are typically arranged in a loose cluster and are highly attractive to pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Romulea celsii is a popular choice for rock gardens due to its ornamental value and adaptability to well-drained conditions."
