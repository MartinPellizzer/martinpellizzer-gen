    "intro": "Reinera, commonly known as the \"buttercup\" or \"false buttercup,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Ranunculaceae. These plants are characterized by their showy, often yellow or orange flowers with five petals, and they typically have palmately divided leaves. Reinera species are native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including parts of Europe, Asia, and North America. They often grow in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Some species are considered invasive in certain areas due to their rapid growth and ability to spread easily."
