    "intro": "Rubus radula var. roetensis, commonly known as the Roetense raspberry, is a rare variant of the raspberry plant native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its small, aggregate fruits that develop from multiple ovaria, typically appearing in shades of red or black. The plant has trifoliate leaves with serrated edges and produces clusters of white flowers during the spring season. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a challenging species to cultivate. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a botanically significant but endangered plant."
