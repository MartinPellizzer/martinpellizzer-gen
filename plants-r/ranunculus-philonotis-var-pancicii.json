    "intro": "Ranunculus philonotis var. pancicii, commonly known as the Pancici's buttercup, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family, characterized by its showy, often yellow or white flowers with numerous petals. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its leaves are deeply lobed and arranged in a basal rosette, while its flowers are usually borne on slender stems. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
