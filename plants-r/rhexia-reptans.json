    "intro": "Rhexia reptans, commonly known as the creeping rhexia, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, acidic soils within woodlands and wetlands. The plant features slender, trailing stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Its showy, pink to purple flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a slightly hairy texture, contributing to its ornamental appeal in garden settings."
