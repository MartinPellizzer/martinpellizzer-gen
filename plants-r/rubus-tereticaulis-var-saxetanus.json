    "intro": "Rubus tereticaulis var. saxetanus, commonly known as the saxifrage raspberry, is a shrub-like plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, thornless stems and small, aggregate fruits that resemble raspberries. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces white or pinkish flowers in the spring. This variety is often found in limestone areas and is adapted to cold, harsh environments."
