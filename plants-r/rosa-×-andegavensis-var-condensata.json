The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are dark green, glossy, and have a serrated edge, contributing to its ornamental value. The species is valued in horticulture for its hardiness and ability to thrive in partial shade."
