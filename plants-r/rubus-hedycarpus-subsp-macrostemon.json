    "intro": "Rubus hedycarpus subsp. macrostemon, commonly known as the large-stamen raspberry, is a shrub native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its biennial growth habit, with stems that are often covered in dense, white-tomentose hairs. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red when mature, and the leaves are ovate to elliptic with serrated margins. It prefers moist, shaded habitats and is often found in forest understories. The subspecies is distinguished by its larger stamens compared to other Rubus species."
