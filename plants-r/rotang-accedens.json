    "intro": "Rotang accedens, commonly known as the Philippine rosewood, is a tropical tree native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Fabaceae and is characterized by its dark, dense wood that is highly valued for its strength and aesthetic qualities. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, pod-like fruits containing seeds. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland and mountainous forest regions. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered a vulnerable species in its natural habitat."
