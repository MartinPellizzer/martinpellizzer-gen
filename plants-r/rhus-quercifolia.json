    "intro": "Rhus quercifolia, commonly known as the glossy buckeye, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its palmately compound leaves, which are glossy and deeply lobed, resembling the leaves of an oak. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by distinctive, spiny, spherical fruits that contain one or two seeds. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age, and it is often found in moist, well-drained soils. Rhus quercifolia is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological importance, providing food and habitat for various wildlife species."
