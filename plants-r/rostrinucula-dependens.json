    "intro": "Rostrinucula dependens, commonly known as the hanging rostrinucula, is a unique epiphytic plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, vine-like stems that can trail or hang from trees, often forming dense clusters. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, which are typically borne on the tips of its stems. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to retain moisture in its humid, shaded habitat. Rostrinucula dependens is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in hanging baskets or as a climbing plant."
