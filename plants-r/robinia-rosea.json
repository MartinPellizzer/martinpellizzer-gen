    "intro": "Robinia rosea, commonly known as the pink robinia or pink false acacia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves that are oval and slightly serrated, and its showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces long, flat seed pods that contain several winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Robinia rosea is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardy nature, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, though it can tolerate a range of environmental conditions."
