    "intro": "Rhynchosia connata, commonly known as the African snout bean, is a climbing legume native to tropical Africa. It features compound leaves with three to five leaflets and produces small, yellow flowers that are followed by pod-like fruits. The plant is characterized by its distinctive seed pods, which are curved and resemble a snout, giving it its common name. Rhynchosia connata is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and savannas. It is also valued for its edible seeds, which are used in local cuisines."
