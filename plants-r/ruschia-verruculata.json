    "intro": "Ruschia verruculata, commonly known as the woolly Ruschia, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is a succulent species characterized by its fleshy, hairy leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-draining soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal, it is widely cultivated in regions with Mediterranean climates."
