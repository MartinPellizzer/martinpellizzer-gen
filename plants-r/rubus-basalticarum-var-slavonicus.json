    "intro": "Rubus basalticarum var. slavonicus, commonly known as the Slavonic bramble, is a variant of the basalticarum species within the Rubus genus. This plant is characterized by its dark, thorny stems and trifoliate leaves with serrated edges. It produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or black in color. The Slavonic bramble thrives in rocky, well-drained soils, often found in mountainous regions. Its botanical features make it well adapted to harsh, nutrient-poor environments."
