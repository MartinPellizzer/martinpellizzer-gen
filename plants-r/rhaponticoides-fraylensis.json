    "intro": "Rhaponticoides fraylensis, commonly known as the Frayl's rhaponticoid, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in moist, temperate climates and is often found in rocky or mountainous habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
