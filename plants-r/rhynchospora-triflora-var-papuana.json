    "intro": "Rhynchospora triflora var. papuana, commonly known as the Papuan three-flowered sedge, is a member of the Cyperaceae family. It is a perennial herb characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, triangular leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, three-flowered inflorescences, which are typically pale green to brown in color. It is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands, often found in wet or marshy habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
