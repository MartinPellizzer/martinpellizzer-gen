    "intro": "Rhamnus frangula var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf buckthorn, is a shrub native to eastern North America. It features dark green, oval-shaped leaves that are typically narrower than those of the typical variety. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by black, egg-shaped berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and thickets. This variety is closely related to other buckthorn species and shares similar ecological roles in its habitat."
