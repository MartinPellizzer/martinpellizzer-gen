    "intro": "Relhania latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf relhania, is a small evergreen shrub native to the eastern regions of South Africa. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its ornamental value lies in its dense foliage and compact growth habit, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a container plant. Relhania latifolia prefers well-drained soil and partial shade, thriving in coastal climates with mild winters."
