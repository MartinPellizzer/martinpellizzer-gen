    "intro": "Ruilopezia grisea, commonly known as the gray beardgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and grayish-green foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Ruilopezia grisea is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid conditions. Its botanical features make it an important component of desert ecosystems."
