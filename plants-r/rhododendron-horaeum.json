It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. The plant features broad, leathery leaves and produces clusters of pink to purple flowers in the spring. It is well adapted to rocky soils and harsh climatic conditions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
