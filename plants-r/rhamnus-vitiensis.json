    "intro": "Rhamnus vitiensis, commonly known as the Vitiensis buckthorn, is a small evergreen shrub native to the island of Viti Levu in Fiji. It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and small, yellowish flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces small, reddish berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in coastal and lowland areas. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
