The plant features heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a weed in some areas."
