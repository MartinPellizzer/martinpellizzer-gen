    "intro": "Raphanistrum silvestre, commonly known as wild radish, is an annual herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features a robust, branching stem that often grows up to 1 meter in height, covered with coarse, hairy leaves that are lance-shaped and have a distinctive mustard-like odor. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous and can develop into a large, fleshy root that is edible and has a strong, pungent flavor. Raphanistrum silvestre is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in meadows, where it thrives in full sun."
