    "intro": "Rhododendron, commonly known as the mountain laurel, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Ericaceae. These plants are characterized by their showy, often brightly colored flowers that bloom in spring. Rhododendrons are evergreen shrubs with leathery, elliptical leaves that remain on the plant year-round. They thrive in acidic, well-drained soils and are often found in temperate regions across the Northern Hemisphere. The genus includes over 1,000 species, many of which are popular in horticulture for their ornamental value."
