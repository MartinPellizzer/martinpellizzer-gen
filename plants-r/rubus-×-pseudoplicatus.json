It is characterized by its thorny stems and large, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces edible berries that are typically dark red to black in color, similar to other Rubus species. It is native to East Asia and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and fruit. However, it can be invasive in certain regions due to its vigorous growth and ability to spread rapidly."
