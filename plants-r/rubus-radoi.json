    "intro": "Rubus radoi, commonly known as the Radoi blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Europe. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically harvested in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a temperate climate with adequate sunlight. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and lesser-known member of the Rubus genus."
