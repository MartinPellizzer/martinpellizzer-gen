    "intro": "Rubus tomentosus, commonly known as the woolly blackberry, is a species of bramble native to North America. It is characterized by its dense, white-tomentose (woolly) underside on its leaves and stems. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically edible. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including woodlands and disturbed soils. Due to its thorny growth habit and attractive berries, it is both ecologically significant and occasionally considered a weed."
