    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 rugosulus, commonly known as the blackberry raspberry, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Rubus ursinus (blackberry) and Rubus idaeus (red raspberry). It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that ripen to a dark purple or black color, often with a tart flavor. It thrives in temperate climates and is commonly found in woodland edges and disturbed soils. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for both ornamental and edible cultivation."
