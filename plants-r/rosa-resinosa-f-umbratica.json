    "intro": "Rosa resinosa f. umbratica, commonly known as the shaded rose, is a rare and unique form of the prickly rose. It is characterized by its dense, dark foliage that thrives in shaded environments, making it well-suited for woodland or shaded garden settings. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white, adding subtle beauty to its natural habitat. Its leaves are typically smaller and more clustered compared to the standard Rosa resinosa, contributing to its distinct appearance. This form is less commonly cultivated but is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological niche."
