    "intro": "Rhus sylvestris, commonly known as the staghorn sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and turn vibrant red in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in panicles, followed by red, fuzzy berries that are a food source for birds and wildlife. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is adaptable to a variety of soil types. Rhus sylvestris is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate urban environments."
