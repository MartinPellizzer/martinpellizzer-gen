    "intro": "Rosa alpina var. pyrenaica, commonly known as the Pyrenean rock rose, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula and southern France. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of fragrant, pink to reddish-pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Its leaves are dark green, serrated, and covered with a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a hardy ornamental plant."
