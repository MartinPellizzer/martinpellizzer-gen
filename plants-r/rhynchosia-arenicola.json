    "intro": "Rhynchosia arenicola, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid and coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a low-growing herb with small, clustered leaves and produces delicate, pink to purple flowers. The plant is adapted to sandy soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for harsh environments. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its spread in suitable habitats. Rhynchosia arenicola plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing nectar for pollinators."
