    "intro": "Rosa rubiginosa subsp. columnifera, commonly known as the columnar rose, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its upright, columnar growth habit, which makes it an excellent choice for small spaces. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, pink to reddish-pink flowers in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are dark green and glossy, with serrated edges, and it is relatively drought-tolerant once established. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardiness."
