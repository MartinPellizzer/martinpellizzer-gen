    "intro": "Ruta graveolens var. montana, commonly known as mountain rue, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features aromatic, pinnately compound leaves with serrated margins, and small yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, round, blackish fruits that are borne in clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or alpine environments. Its strong, bitter scent is characteristic of the Ruta genus, and it has been used historically in traditional medicine."
