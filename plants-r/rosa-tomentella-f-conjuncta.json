    "intro": "Rosa tomentella f. conjuncta, commonly known as the hairy rose or the woolly rose, is a compact shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, white-tomentose (hairy) foliage and stems, which provide a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a soft, fuzzy texture. Rosa tomentella f. conjuncta is often cultivated for its ornamental value and hardy nature in cooler climates."
