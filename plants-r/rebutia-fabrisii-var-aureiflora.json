    "intro": "Rebutia fabrisii var. aureiflora, commonly known as the golden-flowered rebutia, is a compact, low-growing cactus native to Mexico. It features dense clusters of ribbed stems that are typically green with a slight blue or grayish hue. The plant produces bright yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are borne on short, erect pedicels. Its foliage is often covered in fine, white to pale blue hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It is well-suited for rock gardens and requires well-draining soil and full sun to thrive."
