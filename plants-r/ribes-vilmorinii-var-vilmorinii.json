    "intro": "Ribes vilmorinii var. vilmorinii, commonly known as the Vilmorin's gooseberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Europe. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring upright, arching branches covered in small, elliptical leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are followed by edible, tart berries that ripen in late summer. Its foliage is often densely covered with fine, silvery-white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and is also cultivated for its edible fruits."
