    "intro": "Rumex kandavanicus, commonly known as the Kandava sorrel, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive heart-shaped leaves, which are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its rhubarb-like leaves have been historically used in traditional medicine for their astringent properties."
