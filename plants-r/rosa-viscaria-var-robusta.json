    "intro": "Rosa viscaria var. robusta, commonly known as the robust Rosa viscaria, is a vigorous climbing shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features compound leaves with five to seven leaflets, typically arranged in an alternate pattern along its stems. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of pink to red, often with a deep center, during the summer months. Its stems are covered in stiff, hooked prickles, which help it climb and secure itself to supports. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained, sunny conditions."
