    "intro": "Rubus sylvarum, commonly known as the wood raspberry, is a species of bramble native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves, which are typically serrated and have a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits known as drupes, which are red and edible, often used in jams and desserts. It thrives in woodland areas and prefers moist, well-drained soils. Rubus sylvarum plays a role in supporting local wildlife, providing food for birds and insects."
