    "intro": "Rodriguezia venusta, commonly known as the golden flame tree, is a striking tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that are often covered in a waxy, glossy sheen. The plant produces showy, clustered inflorescences of bright yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its rapid growth and ornamental value make it a popular choice for landscaping in warm climates. However, it can become invasive in some regions if not properly managed."
