    "intro": "Rubus uncinatiformis, commonly known as the hooked bramble, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, hairy berries in the fall. Native to parts of North America, it thrives in moist, wooded areas and is often found in disturbed soils. Due to its aggressive growth habit, it can become invasive in certain regions."
