    "intro": "Rubus blepharocarpon, commonly known as the narrow-leaved blackberry, is a species of bramble native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and produces small, dark red to black fruits. The plant has trifoliate leaves with narrow, serrated leaflets and thorny stems. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in woodland edges and hedgerows. The fruit is edible but has a tart flavor, making it a minor source of wild berries."
