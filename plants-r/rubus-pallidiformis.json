    "intro": "Rubus pallidiformis, commonly known as the paleform raspberry, is a species of bramble native to the western United States. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and thorny stems, typical of many Rubus species. The plant produces small, pale yellow to orange berries that are generally not cultivated for consumption. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Botanically, it is notable for its ecological role in supporting local wildlife and its potential for use in native plant landscaping."
