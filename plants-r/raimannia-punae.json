    "intro": "Raimannia punae, commonly known as the Andes mountain grass, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brownish florets, adapted to the harsh, cold environments it inhabits. Raimannia punae is often found in rocky soils and open slopes, where it plays a role in stabilizing the soil and supporting local biodiversity. Its resilience to extreme conditions makes it an important component of alpine ecosystems."
