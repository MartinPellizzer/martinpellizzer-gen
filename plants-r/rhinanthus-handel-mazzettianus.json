It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients. It thrives in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and meadows. Its presence is often an indicator of well-managed, biodiverse ecosystems."
