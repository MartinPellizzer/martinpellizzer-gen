    "intro": "Rosa dumalis f. acutifolia, commonly known as the sharp-leaved rose, is a botanical variant of the Rosa dumalis species. It is characterized by its narrow, acuminate (sharply pointed) leaves, which give it its specific epithet \"acutifolia.\" The plant typically produces fragrant, pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, including parts of the Caucasus and Turkey. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its beauty and hardiness."
