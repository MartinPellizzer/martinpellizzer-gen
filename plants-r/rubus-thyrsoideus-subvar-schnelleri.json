    "intro": "Rubus thyrsoideus subvar. schnelleri, commonly known as the red raspberries, is a subshrub with arching, thorny stems that produce edible berries. It is native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States and grows in moist, shaded environments. The plant has trifoliate leaves with serrated edges and produces small, aggregate fruits that are rich in vitamin C. Its flowers are white and clustered in the axils of the leaves, and the plant is known for its hardy, vigorous growth. The subvariety schnelleri is distinguished by its more compact growth habit and slightly smaller fruit size compared to other Rubus species."
