    "intro": "Rubus corylifolius subsp. dumetorum, commonly known as the shrub raspberry, is a species of bramble native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically trifoliate or pinnate, and its aggregate fruits composed of small drupes. The plant thrives in woodland and shrubland habitats, often in moist, shaded environments. It produces white to pale yellow flowers in the spring, followed by edible berries that are often used in traditional Chinese medicine. The subspecies is distinguished by its more robust growth and slightly different leaf morphology compared to the main species."
