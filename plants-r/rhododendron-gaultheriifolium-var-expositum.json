    "intro": "Rhododendron gaultheriifolium var. expositum, commonly known as the alpine rhododendron, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of bell-shaped, pink to reddish-purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, often in subalpine or alpine zones. Its leaves are leathery and have a distinctive, elongated shape, while its flowers are often borne on erect, hairy stems. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in harsh, cold environments."
