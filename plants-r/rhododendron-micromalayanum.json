    "intro": "Rhododendron micromalayanum, commonly known as the dwarf Malayan rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia, particularly in Malaysia and Indonesia. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in humid, shaded forest environments. The plant produces clusters of showy, tubular flowers that are usually pink or red in color, blooming in the spring. Its leaves are leathery and evergreen, providing a dense canopy that helps it thrive in low-light conditions. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique floral display."
