    "intro": "Reseda fruticulosa, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing shrub that typically reaches heights of 30 to 60 centimeters. The plant produces striking blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and silvery-green, with a fuzzy texture that helps reduce water loss. Reseda fruticulosa is often used in coastal gardens due to its tolerance for salty air and poor soil conditions."
