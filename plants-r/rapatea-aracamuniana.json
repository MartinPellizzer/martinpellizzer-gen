    "intro": "Rapatea aracamuniana, commonly known as the Aracamunian Rapatea, is a flowering plant native to the humid lowland forests of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding structure. The plant produces striking red or orange inflorescences that attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Its foliage is often used in traditional medicine by local communities. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
