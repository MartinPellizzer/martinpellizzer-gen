    "intro": "Rosa canina var. disparabilis, commonly known as the variable hip rose, is a lesser-known variant of the common dogwood rose. It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, featuring petals that vary in color and shape across different populations. The plant typically grows in temperate regions, thriving in well-drained soils and full sunlight. Its fruit, the hip, is similar to that of Rosa canina but may exhibit slight differences in size and color. Due to its limited distribution and genetic variability, it is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptation and speciation."
