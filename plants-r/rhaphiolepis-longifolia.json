It features small, glossy, elliptical leaves that are usually dark green and turn red in autumn. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries in the fall. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and hardy nature. Rhaphiolepis longifolia is well-suited for hedges and garden borders due to its compact growth habit."
