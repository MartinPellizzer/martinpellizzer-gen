    "intro": "Rosa multiflora var. platyphylla, commonly known as the flat-leaf multiflora rose, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its dense, thorny growth habit and its ability to form thickets, making it both ornamental and invasive in some regions. The plant produces fragrant, pink to white flowers in clusters, typically blooming in the spring. Its leaves are oval and have a flat, broad shape, which distinguishes it from other rose varieties. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often used in landscaping, though its aggressive growth can pose challenges in natural areas."
