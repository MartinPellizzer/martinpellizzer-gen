    "intro": "Rubus rosaceus microgene balneariensis, commonly known as the Balneary raspberry, is a rare and specialized species within the Rubus genus. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers and bristly, thorned stems, typical of many Rubus species. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near mineral springs or in damp woodlands. Its fruit, though not widely cultivated, is edible and has a tart, aromatic flavor. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
