    "intro": "Ruta angustifolia subsp. bracteosa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rue, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, pinnately compound leaves and small yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has distinctive bracts beneath its inflorescence, which are often mistaken for leaves. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rocky or dry garden environments. The essential oils found in its leaves and stems have been used historically for their medicinal and aromatic properties."
