    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 integelliformis, commonly known as the blackberry-loganberry hybrid, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It is a tetraploid hybrid resulting from the cross between Rubus ursinus (blackberry) and Rubus loganobaccus (loganberry). The plant produces large, dark purple to black berries that are typically larger and sweeter than those of its parent species. Its thorny stems and compound leaves are typical of the Rubus genus. It is often cultivated for its edible fruit and ornamental value in gardens."
