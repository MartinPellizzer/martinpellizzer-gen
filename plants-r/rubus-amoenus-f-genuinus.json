    "intro": "Rubus amoenus f. genuinus, commonly known as the Alpine raspberry, is a compact shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its small, hairy leaves and clusters of white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, tart red berries that are typically harvested in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or alpine settings. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often cultivated in gardens with cool, temperate climates."
