    "intro": "Rubus stimuleus, commonly known as the stimulant raspberry, is a species of bramble native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, bright red berries that ripen in late summer. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, often found in mountainous regions. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the flowers are typically white or pale pink. The berries are edible and have a tart flavor, making them a popular ingredient in local cuisines and traditional remedies."
