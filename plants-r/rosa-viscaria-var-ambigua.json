    "intro": "Rosa viscaria var. ambigua, commonly known as the creeping rose, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, spreading habit, with slender stems that root at the nodes. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink to white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three ovate to elliptic leaflets, and the plant is often found in moist, shady habitats. Rosa viscaria var. ambigua is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to form dense ground cover."
