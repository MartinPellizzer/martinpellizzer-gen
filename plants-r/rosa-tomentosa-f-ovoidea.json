    "intro": "Rosa tomentosa f. ovoidea, commonly known as the woolly rose or fuzzy rose, is a compact, deciduous shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, grayish-white pubescence covering the stems, leaves, and young shoots, giving it a distinctive fuzzy appearance. The leaves are typically oval to elliptic in shape, with a soft, velvety texture. Its flowers are usually pale pink to white, appearing in clusters and blooming in late spring to early summer. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and modest floral display."
