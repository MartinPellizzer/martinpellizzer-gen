    "intro": "Rubus sprengelii var. heteracanthus, commonly known as the hairy raspberry, is a variant of the raspberry plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and dark red to black berries that ripen in late summer. The leaves are typically trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the plant thrives in well-drained, acidic soils. It is a shrub that can grow up to 2 meters tall, often found in forested areas and rocky slopes. The berries are edible but have a tart flavor, making them suitable for use in jams and wines."
