It is characterized by its fragrant, pink to white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in marshy or swampy areas, thriving in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a serrated edge. Rosa mosquensis is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
