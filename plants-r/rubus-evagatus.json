    "intro": "Rubus evagatus, commonly known as the trailing blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the northern regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and thorny stems, which often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are edible but have a tart flavor. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it thrives in moist, acidic soils. Rubus evagatus plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing food for wildlife and stabilizing soil in wetland areas."
