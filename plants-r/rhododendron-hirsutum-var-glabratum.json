    "intro": "Rhododendron hirsutum var. glabratum, commonly known as the smooth-leaved rhododendron, is a compact evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of western China. It features dense, leathery foliage that is typically glabrous, or hairless, distinguishing it from its parent species. The plant produces showy, clustered flowers in shades of pink to purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and long-lasting floral display."
