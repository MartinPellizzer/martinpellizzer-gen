    "intro": "Rhinanthus praesignis, commonly known as the early red clover, is a flowering plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant is characterized by its bright orange to red flowers that bloom in early summer. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as grasslands and wastelands. Rhinanthus praesignis plays a role in supporting pollinators and is considered a rare and declining species in parts of its native range."
