    "intro": "Rosa canina var. euoxyphlla, commonly known as the European dog rose, is a variant of the common rose native to Europe and western Asia. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters, featuring thorny stems and pinnate leaves with five to seven leaflets. The plant produces pink to red flowers in early summer, which are followed by orange to reddish hips, the fruit of the plant. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in hedgerows and woodland edges. The hips are rich in vitamin C and have been used in traditional herbal medicine."
