    "intro": "Roemeria minor, commonly known as the lesser roemeria, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in umbel-like clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Roemeria minor thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
