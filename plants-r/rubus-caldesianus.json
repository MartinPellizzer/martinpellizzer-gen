    "intro": "Rubus caldesianus, commonly known as the Caldesian blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically harvested in late summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
