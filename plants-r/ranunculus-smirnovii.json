    "intro": "Ranunculus smirnovii, commonly known as the Smirnov's buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, palmate leaves and showy, yellow flowers with prominent white veins. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, thriving in well-drained, rocky soils. It is known for its short flowering period, usually in late spring to early summer, and is often found in high-altitude meadows. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
