    "intro": "Rosa przewalskii, commonly known as the Przewalski's rose, is a species of flowering plant native to the high altitudes of Tibet and northern Nepal. It is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit, with thorny stems and dark green, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces fragrant, pink to reddish-pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Rosa przewalskii is valued for its ornamental beauty and is also studied for its potential medicinal properties. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
