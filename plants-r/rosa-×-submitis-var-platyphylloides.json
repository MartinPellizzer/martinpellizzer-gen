    "intro": "Rosa \u00d7 submitis var. platyphylloides, commonly known as the flat-leaf shrub rose, is a hybrid rose species characterized by its dense, thorny growth habit and compact form. It features broad, flat leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy on the upper surface. The plant produces fragrant, semi-double flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, often with a strong, sweet scent. It is well-suited for hedges or as a specimen plant due to its vigorous growth and ornamental value. This variety is relatively disease-resistant and thrives in full sun with well-drained soil."
