    "intro": "Remijia pacimonica, commonly known as the Pacific moonflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the coastal regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, white, nocturnal blooms that open at night and close during the day. The plant has thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. Its flowers emit a sweet fragrance to attract pollinators such as moths. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
