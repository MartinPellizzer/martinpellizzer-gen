It is native to South America, particularly found in regions of Chile and Argentina. The plant is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small white or pink flowers. Its leaves are typically trifoliate, with a serrated edge, and it produces edible berries that are often consumed by wildlife. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
