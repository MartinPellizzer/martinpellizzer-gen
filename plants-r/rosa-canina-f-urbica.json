    "intro": "Rosa canina f. urbica, commonly known as the urban rose, is a compact shrub with thorny stems and small, reddish-orange flowers. It is a natural variant of the dog rose, adapted to thrive in urban environments. The plant produces hips, which are red, hairy fruits containing a high concentration of vitamin C. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with serrated edges, and it is often found growing in waste ground or along roadsides. This form is valued for its resilience and ability to tolerate pollution, making it a common sight in city landscapes."
