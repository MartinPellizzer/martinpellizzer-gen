    "intro": "Rubus caesius microgene sabulosus, commonly known as the sandy raspberry, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California. It is characterized by its small, prickly stems and clusters of white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible but have a tart flavor. It thrives in sandy soils and is adapted to coastal climates with high salinity and strong winds. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
