    "intro": "Ranunculus sessiliflorus var. pilulifer, commonly known as the cushion buttercup, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit, forming a cushion-like structure that helps it survive in harsh alpine conditions. The plant produces small, showy flowers with five petals, typically in shades of yellow or white, and has finely divided, fern-like leaves. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is a subject of interest in botanical research and conservation efforts."
