    "intro": "Rhododendron tephropeplum, commonly known as the Andean rhododendron, is a species native to the high-altitude regions of South America, particularly in the Andes. It is a shrub that typically grows in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil. The plant produces dense clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Rhododendron tephropeplum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in temperate climates."
