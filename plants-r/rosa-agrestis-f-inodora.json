    "intro": "Rosa agrestis f. inodora, commonly known as the scentless field rose, is a botanical variant of the species Rosa agrestis. It is characterized by its lack of a strong floral fragrance, which distinguishes it from other rose cultivars. The plant typically features simple, pinnate leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink to white in color. It thrives in open, sunny environments and is often found in meadows and along roadsides. Botanically, it is noted for its adaptability to various soil types and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
