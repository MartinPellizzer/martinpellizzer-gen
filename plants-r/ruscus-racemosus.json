    "intro": "Ruscus racemosus, commonly known as common spurge or sea spurge, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that are followed by red, berry-like fruits. Its stems are often used in traditional medicine for their astringent properties. Ruscus racemosus thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
