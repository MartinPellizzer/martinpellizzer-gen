    "intro": "Rhamnus ramiflora, commonly known as the branched buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Africa. It typically grows to a height of 2 to 5 meters, featuring slender, often branched stems covered in small, glossy leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by dark blue berries that are edible for birds and mammals. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a slightly serrated edge, while its bark is smooth and grayish in color. Rhamnus ramiflora is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, often found in woodland and scrub habitats."
