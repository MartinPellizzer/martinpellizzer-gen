    "intro": "Robertia taraxacoides var. taurina, commonly known as the Taurine Robertia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It features a basal rosette of narrow, silver-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a single stem, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
