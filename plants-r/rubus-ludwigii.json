    "intro": "Rubus ludwigii, commonly known as the Ludwig's blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its trailing or shrub-like growth habit and produces dark purple to black berries. The plant features compound leaves with serrated edges and thorny stems typical of the Rubus genus. It thrives in arid to semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along stream banks. The berries are edible, though they are generally smaller and less sweet compared to other blackberry varieties."
