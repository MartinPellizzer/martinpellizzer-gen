    "intro": "Rubus glaberrimus, commonly known as the smooth blackberry, is a species of bramble native to North America. It is characterized by its thornless stems and dark purple to black berries that ripen in late summer. The plant produces compound leaves with serrated edges and small, white flowers that bloom in the spring. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, loamy soils. The berries are often used in jams, pies, and other culinary applications due to their sweet, tart flavor."
