    "intro": "Rennellia speciosa var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved Rennellia, is a flowering plant native to the island of Rennell in the Solomon Islands. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to saline and well-drained soils. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family, which includes many ornamental and medicinal plants. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
