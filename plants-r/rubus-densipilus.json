    "intro": "Rubus densipilus, commonly known as the dense-hair raspberry, is a species of bramble native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, dark red berries that ripen in late summer. The plant has compound leaves with serrated edges and is covered in dense, fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The berries are edible but have a tart flavor, making them a valuable resource in some traditional cuisines."
