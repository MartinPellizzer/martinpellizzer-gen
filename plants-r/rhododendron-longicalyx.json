    "intro": "Rhododendron longicalyx, commonly known as the long-leaf rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elongated, leathery leaves that can grow up to 20 centimeters in length. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It typically thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade in its natural habitat. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it requires specific care to maintain its health."
