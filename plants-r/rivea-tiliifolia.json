    "intro": "Rivea tiliifolia, commonly known as the white morning glory, is a climbing vine native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy white or pale pink flowers that bloom in the morning. The plant produces small, round fruits that contain seeds, and it thrives in warm, humid climates. Rivea tiliifolia is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine. Its rapid growth habit makes it suitable for trellises or as a ground cover in gardens."
