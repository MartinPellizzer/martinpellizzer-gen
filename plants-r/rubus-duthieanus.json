It is native to the mountainous regions of Scotland, particularly on the Isle of Skye. The plant is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early summer. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three leaflets that are serrated along the edges. The fruit, a red, raspberry-like berry, is edible and often used in local traditional foods."
