    "intro": "Rotheca myricoides var. kilimandscharensis, commonly known as the Kilimanjaro rotheca, is a shrub native to the high-altitude regions of East Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which appear in the summer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the cool, humid climates of its native habitat. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
