    "intro": "Rhododendron fruticosum, commonly known as the creeping azalea, is a dense, evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It features broad, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and arranged in whorls around the stems. The plant produces clusters of showy, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink and red, blooming in spring. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soil and prefers partial to full shade. Rhododendron fruticosum is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to form thick, low-growing ground cover."
