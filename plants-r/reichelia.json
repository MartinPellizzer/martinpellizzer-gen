    "intro": "Reichelia, commonly known as the African violets, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Gesneriaceae. These plants are native to tropical regions of Africa, Madagascar, and the Caribbean. Reichelia species are characterized by their showy, tubular flowers that come in a variety of colors, including purple, blue, and white. They typically have thick, waxy leaves that help them retain moisture in their native habitats. Reichelia plants are popular as houseplants due to their ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
