    "intro": "Rhynchopyle loi, commonly known as the golden flame orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow and orange floral bracts, which resemble flames, giving it its common name. The plant has a slender, erect stem and produces small, fragrant flowers arranged in a dense inflorescence. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, waxy coating that helps retain moisture in its arid habitat. Rhynchopyle loi is highly sought after by botanists and horticulturists due to its unique appearance and limited distribution."
