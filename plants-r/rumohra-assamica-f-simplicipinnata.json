    "intro": "Rumohra assamica f. simplicipinnata, commonly known as the simple-pinnate fern, is a variant of the Assam grass fern. It is characterized by its slender, erect fronds that are typically unbranched, giving it a simple pinnate structure. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, which are clustered in sori. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
