    "intro": "Rubus schleicheri var. inaequabiliformis, commonly known as the unequal-leaf blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, asymmetrical leaf shapes, which set it apart from other Rubus species. The plant produces small, dark berries that are typically harvested in late summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
