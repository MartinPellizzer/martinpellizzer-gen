    "intro": "Rhamnus repens, commonly known as creeping buckthorn, is a low-growing shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its prostrate or decumbent stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant has small, oval leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces yellowish-green flowers in early spring. Its fruits are small, dark berries that ripen in late summer, providing food for birds and other wildlife. Rhamnus repens is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks."
