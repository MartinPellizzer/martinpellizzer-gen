    "intro": "Rafflesia, commonly known as the corpse flower, is a parasitic plant found in the rainforests of Indonesia. It is renowned for producing the largest individual flowers in the world, which can reach diameters of up to three feet. The plant lacks leaves, stems, and roots, relying entirely on its host tree for nutrients. Its flowers emit a strong, unpleasant odor reminiscent of decaying flesh, which attracts flies and carrion beetles as pollinators. Despite its striking appearance, Rafflesia is rare and highly sensitive to habitat destruction."
