    "intro": "Rosa tomentella subsp. borreri, commonly known as the Borreri's woolly rose, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and thorny stems, which provide protection against herbivores. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink to white, typically blooming in late spring. Its leaves are oval-shaped with a soft, fuzzy texture, and it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
