It is characterized by its elongated petioles, which distinguish it from the typical form of Rubia tinctorum. The plant produces pale yellow flowers and has heart-shaped leaves with a soft, fuzzy texture. It is native to southern Europe and thrives in dry, sunny environments. This cultivar is often grown for its ornamental value and historical use in dyeing fabrics."
