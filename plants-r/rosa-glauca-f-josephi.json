    "intro": "Rosa glauca f. josephi, commonly known as the Joseph's blue rose, is a horticultural form of the blue rose, a cultivar that exhibits a unique blue hue due to the presence of delphinidin, a type of anthocyanin pigment. This plant is a hybrid of Rosa glauca, which is native to the Caucasus region, and is characterized by its compact growth habit and abundant, semi-double to fully double blue flowers. The foliage is typically dark green with a bluish tinge, and the plant is known for its cold hardiness and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. It is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and is relatively disease-resistant, making it a popular choice for both novice and experienced gardeners."
