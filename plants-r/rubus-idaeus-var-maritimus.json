    "intro": "Rubus idaeus var. maritimus, commonly known as the coastal raspberry, is a variant of the common raspberry that thrives in coastal environments. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and the production of small, tart red berries. The plant is adapted to salty air and sandy soils, often found in dunes and other coastal habitats. Its leaves are typically trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it produces white flowers in the spring. This variant is valued for its hardiness and ability to stabilize coastal dunes through its extensive root system."
