    "intro": "Rhodax dichrous, commonly known as the two-sided rhodax, is a unique flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive two-lobed leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its botanical significance lies in its rare morphology and ecological role in its native habitat. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in the wild."
