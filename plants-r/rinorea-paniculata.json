    "intro": "Rinorea paniculata, commonly known as the silverleaf or white-flowered rinorea, is a tropical shrub native to regions of South America. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers arranged in paniculate inflorescences, which bloom during the rainy season. Its flowering period is typically associated with high humidity and warm temperatures. Rinorea paniculata is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories."
