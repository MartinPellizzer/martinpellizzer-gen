    "intro": "Rhamnus colchica, commonly known as the Colchian buckthorn, is a shrub native to the eastern Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its small, dark green leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers in the spring. The plant bears reddish-black berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain bird species. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in woodland and scrubland habitats. Rhamnus colchica is valued for its ornamental appeal and has historical uses in traditional medicine."
