    "intro": "Racosperma araneosum, commonly known as the spider-fig, is a flowering plant native to northern Australia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its unique, spiny pods that resemble a spider's web. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are bipinnate, consisting of multiple small leaflets, and it produces small, yellow flowers clustered in dense inflorescences. The species is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient component of its native ecosystem."
