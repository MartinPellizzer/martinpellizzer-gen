    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 incommodus, commonly known as the blackberry raspberry, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Rubus ursinus (the raspberry) and Rubus chamaemorus (the cloudberry). It is a deciduous shrub that produces edible berries, which are typically a mix of blackberry and raspberry characteristics. The plant has compound leaves with serrated edges and produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers in the spring. The berries ripen in late summer and are known for their tart flavor and high antioxidant content. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for both its fruit and ornamental value."
