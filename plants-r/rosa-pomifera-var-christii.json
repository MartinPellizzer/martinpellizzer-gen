    "intro": "Rosa pomifera var. christii, commonly known as the Christ's rose, is a rare and ornamental shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and large, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces distinctive, edible fruits known as \"pommes de rose,\" which are prized for their sweet, apple-like flavor. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its rarity and unique appearance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by specialty growers."
