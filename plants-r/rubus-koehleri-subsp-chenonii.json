    "intro": "Rubus koehleri subsp. chenonii, commonly known as the Chenonii blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and thorny stems, typical of the Rubus genus. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black in color. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and less commonly cultivated species."
