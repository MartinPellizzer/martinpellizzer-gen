    "intro": "Ranunculus eradicatus, commonly known as the lesser celandine, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features basal leaves that are heart-shaped and often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces bright yellow flowers with five petals, typically appearing in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, making it both a common weed and an important early-season nectar source for pollinators."
