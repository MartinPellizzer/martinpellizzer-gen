    "intro": "Rhinanthus wagneri subsp. caroli-henrici, commonly known as the Caroli-Henrici's yellow rattle, is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients while still performing photosynthesis. The plant typically grows in grasslands and heathlands, preferring well-drained soils. Its flowers are tubular and appear in clusters, often blooming from June to August. It plays a role in supporting pollinators and is of conservation interest due to its specialized habitat requirements."
