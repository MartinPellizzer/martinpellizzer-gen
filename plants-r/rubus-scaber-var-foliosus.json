    "intro": "Rubus scaber var. foliosus, commonly known as the rough raspberry or prickly raspberry, is a variant of the raspberry plant native to parts of Asia and Europe. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or yellow when mature. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland or scrubland habitats. Due to its brambly growth habit, it can be both a valuable wild plant and a potential weed in cultivated areas."
