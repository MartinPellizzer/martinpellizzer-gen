    "intro": "Rosa canina f. fraxinoides, commonly known as the Fraxinoid dogwood rose, is a botanical variant of the common rose. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated, and often branched stems that resemble those of the fraxinoid tree. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically arranged in clusters, and its leaves are simple with a serrated margin. It is a shrub-like form that exhibits a more tree-like growth habit compared to the typical rose species. This form is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique appearance."
