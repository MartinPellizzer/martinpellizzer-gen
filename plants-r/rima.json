    "intro": "Rima, commonly known as the \"ghost flower,\" is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent petals that resemble thin, ghostly veils. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom only under specific environmental conditions, making it difficult to study. Its botanical structure includes a short stem and a single, slender leaf. Due to its elusive nature and limited habitat, Rima is considered a rare and endangered species."
