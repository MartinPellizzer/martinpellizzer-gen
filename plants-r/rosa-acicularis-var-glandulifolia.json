    "intro": "Rosa acicularis var. glandulifolia, commonly known as the glandular thorned rose, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, thorned stems and small, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring. The leaves are simple, alternate, and covered with glandular hairs, giving the plant its specific epithet. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in colder climates."
