    "intro": "Rubus foliolatus var. dasybotrys, commonly known as the velvet-leaf blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and thorny stems, which are typical features of the Rubus genus. The leaves are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a velvety texture that gives the plant its common name. It produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple or black when mature. This plant is often found in moist, shaded environments and is valued for both its ornamental appeal and potential use in traditional medicine."
