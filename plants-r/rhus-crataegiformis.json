    "intro": "Rhus crataegiformis, commonly known as the honeylocust, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Anacardiaceae family, which includes other plants like poison ivy and mango. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often divided into small, oval-shaped leaflets. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers that give way to reddish or blackish fruits, which are edible for some wildlife but can be toxic to humans. The honeylocust is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in various soil conditions."
