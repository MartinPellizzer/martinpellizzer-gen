    "intro": "Riana tricapsularis, commonly known as the three-capsuled riana, is a flowering plant native to specific regions in Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its showy, pentagonal flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, tropical environments and has hairy stems and leaves. Its fruit is a three-lobed capsule that splits open to release seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Riana tricapsularis is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been studied for its potential ecological roles in its native habitats."
