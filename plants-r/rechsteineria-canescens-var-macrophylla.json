    "intro": "Rechsteineria canescens var. macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaved rechsteineria, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South America. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Due to its ornamental value and unique foliage, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and specialty plant collections."
