    "intro": "Rhododendron sparsifolium, commonly known as the sparse-leaved rhododendron, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in acidic, well-drained soils and thrives in partially shaded to sunny conditions. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, providing a striking contrast to the vibrant floral displays. Rhododendron sparsifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
