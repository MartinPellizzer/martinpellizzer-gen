    "intro": "Racosperma volubile, commonly known as the climbing legume, is a perennial shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of Australia. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod fruits. The plant features tendrils that allow it to climb and spread across other vegetation. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, often in shades of pink or white. The plant's ability to fix nitrogen makes it ecologically significant in nutrient-poor soils."
