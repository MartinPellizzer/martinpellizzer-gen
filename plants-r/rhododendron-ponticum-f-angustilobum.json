It is characterized by its elongated, narrow leaves that are typically a dark green color with a slightly glossy surface. The plant produces dense clusters of deep pink to purple flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It is native to the Caucasus region and thrives in moist, acidic soils. This form is often found in woodland areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
