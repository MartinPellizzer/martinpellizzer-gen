    "intro": "Rapistrum cordylocarpus, commonly known as the sea rocket, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the eastern Mediterranean. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants. The plant has basal leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its salty, windy habitat. Its yellow flowers are small and clustered in racemes, blooming from spring to early summer. The plant is often found growing in sandy or rocky soils near the shoreline, where it thrives in saline conditions."
