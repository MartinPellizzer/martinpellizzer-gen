    "intro": "Rubus geniculatus subsp. hebes, commonly known as the alpine blackberry, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, arching stems and small, trifoliate leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces aggregate fruits composed of tiny, dark red to black achenes, which are typically borne on peduncles. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in cooler climates."
