    "intro": "Rubus banningii subsp. gelertii, commonly known as the Gelert's blackberry, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, dark red to black berries that are typically harvested in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers a sunny to partially shaded environment. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
