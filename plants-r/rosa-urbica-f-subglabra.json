    "intro": "Rosa urbica f. subglabra, commonly known as the smooth urban rose, is a botanical variant of the common dog\u73ab\u7470. It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous stems and leaves, distinguishing it from the typical hairy forms of Rosa urbica. This plant is often found in urban environments, such as along sidewalks and in disturbed soils, due to its adaptability. Its flowers are typically pink to red, with five petals, and it produces hips that contain seeds. The subspecies is valued for its ornamental qualities and resilience in human-altered landscapes."
