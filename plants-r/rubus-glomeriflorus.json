    "intro": "Rubus glomeriflorus, commonly known as the clustered-flower raspberry, is a species of bramble native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, thorny growth habit and clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers. The plant produces edible berries that are typically red or black in color, though they are often too tart for fresh consumption. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Botanically, it belongs to the Rosaceae family, sharing features with other raspberries and blackberries."
