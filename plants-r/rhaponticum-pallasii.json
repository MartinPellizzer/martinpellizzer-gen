    "intro": "Rhaponticum pallasii, commonly known as the Siberian cowplant, is a perennial herb native to the cold regions of Asia. It features a stout, upright stem that can grow up to 1.5 meters tall, covered with glandular hairs. The plant produces large, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, arranged in a single head at the top of the stem. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, white pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Rhaponticum pallasii is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand harsh, alpine environments."
