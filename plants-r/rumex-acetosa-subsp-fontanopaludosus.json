    "intro": "Rumex acetosa subsp. fontanopaludosus, commonly known as the water sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to moist habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its upright, sometimes reddish stems and trifoliate leaves with a waxy coating. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are typically borne on leafless stalks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies in wet soils. This subspecies is often found in marshes, stream banks, and other damp environments, where it thrives in nutrient-rich, waterlogged conditions."
