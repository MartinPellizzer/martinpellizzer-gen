    "intro": "Rhamnus oleoides subsp. microphylla, commonly known as the dwarf buckthorn, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually less than 2 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by dark blue berries that are edible for birds. Its compact size and dense growth habit make it suitable for use in ornamental landscaping and as a ground cover. The subspecies is distinguished by its smaller leaves compared to other subspecies within the Rhamnus oleoides species complex."
