    "intro": "Rosa canina var. cabradensis, commonly known as the Serbian rose, is a variant of the dog rose native to the Balkan Peninsula. It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of pale pink to white flowers. The plant produces aggregate fruits, known as rosehips, which are rich in vitamin C and have been used in traditional medicine. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils. Its botanical features make it an important species for both ecological and historical studies."
