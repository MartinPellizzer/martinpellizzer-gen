It is characterized by its vibrant yellow petals and a compact, bushy growth habit. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing clusters of fragrant flowers. Its leaves are dark green, serrated, and arranged alternately along the stems. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires careful conservation efforts."
