    "intro": "Rectomitra, commonly known as the spiral orchid, is a unique member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) characterized by its distinctive spiral arrangement of leaves. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant features a sympodial growth habit, with each stem producing a new growth at the base of the previous one. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, often with a striking coloration that ranges from white to yellow. The botanical significance of Rectomitra lies in its morphological adaptations and its role in the ecological diversity of its native habitats."
