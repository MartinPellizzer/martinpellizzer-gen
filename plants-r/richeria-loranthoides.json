    "intro": "Richeria loranthoides, commonly known as the Indian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the family Rutaceae. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing some photosynthesis using limited chlorophyll. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences, and its fruit is a small, fleshy capsule containing several seeds. It is native to regions of India and Southeast Asia, where it thrives in humid, tropical climates. Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host tree if left unchecked, but it also plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for certain birds and insects."
