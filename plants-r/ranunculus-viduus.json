    "intro": "Ranunculus viduus, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and delicate member of the buttercup family. It is native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom in early spring. Its leaves are deeply lobed and covered in fine hairs, aiding in water retention. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ranunculus viduus is considered endangered and is often found in protected conservation areas."
