    "intro": "Reynoutria multiflora, commonly known as the Japanese knotweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to East Asia. It is characterized by its rapid growth rate and ability to spread through both rhizomes and seeds, making it an invasive species in many regions. The plant has hollow, bamboo-like stems that are often covered in a reddish sheath at the nodes. Its heart-shaped leaves are typically green with a slightly hairy texture. Reynoutria multiflora produces small, white to greenish flowers in clusters, which are followed by dark berries that can persist into winter."
