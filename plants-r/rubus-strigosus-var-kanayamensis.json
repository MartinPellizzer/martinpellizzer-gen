    "intro": "Rubus strigosus var. kanayamensis, commonly known as the Kanayama brambles, is a variant of the bramble genus Rubus native to Japan. It is a shrub characterized by its thorny stems and trifoliate leaves, which are typically covered in a dense layer of stinging hairs. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits known as drupes, which are usually red or black when mature. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
