    "intro": "Ranunculus aquatilis subsp. trichophyllus, commonly known as the water crowfoot, is a aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in shallow water, along the edges of ponds, streams, and lakes. The plant has finely divided, feather-like leaves that are often submerged or floating, and it produces small, yellowish flowers with five petals. Its roots are rhizomatous, allowing it to spread vegetatively and colonize new areas. This species is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-rich waters and can sometimes become invasive in non-native habitats."
