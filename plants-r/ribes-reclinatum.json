    "intro": "Ribes reclinatum, commonly known as the creeping gooseberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its trailing stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats of foliage. The plant produces small, yellow-orange flowers in late spring, followed by edible, tart berries in the summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have serrated edges, often covered in fine hairs. Ribes reclinatum thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats."
