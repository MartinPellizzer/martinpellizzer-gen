    "intro": "Rosa kattegatensis, commonly known as the Kattegat rose, is a rare and unique species native to the coastal regions of the Kattegat Sea in Northern Europe. It is a shrub-like plant with woody stems and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline, adapting to the harsh coastal environment. Its leaves are compound, with five to seven leaflets, and the flowers are usually pink or white in color. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
