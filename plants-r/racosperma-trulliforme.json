    "intro": "Racosperma trulliforme, commonly known as the umbrella acacia, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive umbrella-shaped inflorescence, which consists of many small, fluffy flowers arranged in a spherical cluster. The plant belongs to the Fabaceae family, also known as the legume or pea family, and is known for its nitrogen-fixing abilities. Its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into two sets of small leaflets, and it produces small, pod-like fruits. Racosperma trulliforme is often found in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments."
