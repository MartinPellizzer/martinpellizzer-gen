    "intro": "Rosa coriifolia var. hoffmannii, commonly known as the Hoffmann's sweetbriar, is a deciduous shrub native to China. It features fragrant, white to pink flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves appear. The plant has thorny stems and pinnately compound leaves with serrated edges. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its delicate blooms and historical use in traditional Chinese medicine."
