    "intro": "Rubus subincisus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved blackberry, is a species of bramble native to western North America. It is characterized by its slender, thorny stems and trifoliate leaves with sharply toothed margins. The plant produces aggregate fruits, known as blackberries, which are typically dark purple to black in color. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including woodlands and disturbed soils, and is often found in the Pacific Northwest. The plant is valued for its edible fruits and is also used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature."
