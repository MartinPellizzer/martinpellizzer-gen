    "intro": "Rubus foliosus var. eriocarpus, commonly known as the hairy-fruited blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to parts of North America. It is characterized by its dense, hairy covering on the fruit, which gives it a distinctive appearance and texture. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically harvested in late summer. Its leaves are compound, with three to five leaflets, and the stems are thorny. This variety is often found in woodland areas and thrives in moist, well-drained soils."
