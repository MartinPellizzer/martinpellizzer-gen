    "intro": "Rosa sanctimarci, commonly known as the Saint Marci rose, is a rare and ancient species of shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its fragrant, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has woody stems covered in thorns and dark green, serrated leaves. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
