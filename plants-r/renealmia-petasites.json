    "intro": "Renealmia petasites, commonly known as the giant swamp fern, is a large, aquatic fern native to the wetlands of South America. It has large, broad leaves that can grow up to several meters in length, often floating on the water's surface. The plant thrives in shallow, still or slow-moving water, and its rhizomes spread along the substrate. Its fronds are typically divided into numerous segments, giving it a feathery appearance. It plays an important ecological role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen."
