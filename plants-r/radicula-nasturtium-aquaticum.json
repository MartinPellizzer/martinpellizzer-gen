    "intro": "Radicula nasturtium-aquaticum, commonly known as watercress, is a flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its submerged or floating leaves and small, yellow flowers that bloom above the water surface. The plant is native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa, and it thrives in freshwater environments such as streams, ponds, and ditches. Its leaves are edible and have a peppery taste, making it a popular ingredient in salads and soups. The plant's rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative reproduction contribute to its success in aquatic habitats."
