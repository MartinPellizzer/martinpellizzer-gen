It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. Rindera tschotkalensis is adapted to grow in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies on alpine flora and plant adaptation."
