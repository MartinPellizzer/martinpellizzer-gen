    "intro": "Rapistrum ceratocnemum, commonly known as the prickly lettuce, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features a hairy, upright stem that can grow up to 1 meter in height, often branching towards the upper part. The leaves are lanceolate, with serrated edges and a distinctive prickly texture, which gives the plant its common name. Its flowers are small, yellow, and clustered in a loose inflorescence, typical of the Asteraceae family. The plant produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution."
