    "intro": "Rosa sempervirens var. reptans, commonly known as the creeping evergreen rose, is a deciduous shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, thornless growth habit and dark green, leathery leaves that remain on the plant throughout the winter. The plant produces fragrant, single or semi-double flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for landscaping in temperate climates."
