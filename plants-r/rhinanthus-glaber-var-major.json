    "intro": "Rhinanthus glaber var. major, commonly known as the greater yellow rocket, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Orobanchaceae. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from the roots of other plants. The plant is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It typically grows in disturbed soils and is often found in open habitats such as roadsides and woodland edges. The leaves are lance-shaped and the stems are often branched, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
