    "intro": "Rumex patientia var. kurdicus, commonly known as Kurdish dock, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It features basal leaves that are large, broad, and often have a wavy or lobed margin. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers in the spring, which are arranged in dense, upright spikes. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively and thrive in moist, disturbed soils. It is often found in rocky or alpine habitats and is valued for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal practices."
