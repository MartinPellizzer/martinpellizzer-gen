    "intro": "Ranunculus alpestris f. ambiguus, commonly known as the alpine buttercup, is a botanical variant of the alpine buttercup, characterized by its delicate, yellow flowers and hairy, lance-shaped leaves. It is native to mountainous regions in Europe and Asia, thriving in alpine and subalpine habitats. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Its flowers are usually solitary, with five to eight sepals that resemble petals, and it blooms in late spring to early summer. This form is notable for its variability in leaf shape and flower structure, which contributes to its classification as a botanical form."
