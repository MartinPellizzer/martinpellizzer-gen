    "intro": "Rosa unica, commonly known as the rare white rose, is a unique species native to the alpine regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its pale pink to white petals and dark green, serrated leaves. The plant produces fragrant, single blooms that are highly sought after by horticulturists. It thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Rosa unica is considered a rare and endangered species."
