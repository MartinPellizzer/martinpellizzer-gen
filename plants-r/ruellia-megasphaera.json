    "intro": "Ruellia megasphaera, commonly known as the large-sphere ruellia, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters tall, characterized by its opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves. The plant produces showy blue to purple flowers in clusters, which are typically tubular and attract pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. Its flowers are followed by spherical, greenish seed capsules that split open to release the seeds. Ruellia megasphaera is often cultivated for its ornamental value in tropical and subtropical gardens."
