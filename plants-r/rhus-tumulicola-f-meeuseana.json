    "intro": "Rhus tumulicola f. meeuseana, commonly known as the Meeuse's sumac, is a rare and unique variant of the sumac genus. It is a shrub characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically arranged in pairs along the stem. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that develop into red, fuzzy berries, a feature common in many sumac species. It thrives in specific ecological conditions, often found in moist, acidic soils in woodland areas. Due to its limited distribution and distinct morphology, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
