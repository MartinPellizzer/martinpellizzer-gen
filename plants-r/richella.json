    "intro": "Richella, commonly known as the \"garden spurge,\" is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family, characterized by its milky sap and showy, yellow-orange flowers. It typically grows in moist, shady environments and is native to parts of Europe and Asia. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences called cyathia. Richella is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique floral structure. However, it contains toxic compounds and should be handled with care."
