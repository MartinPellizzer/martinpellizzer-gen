    "intro": "Robrichia, commonly known as the golden cupplant, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It features a robust, upright stem that can grow up to six feet tall, adorned with large, heart-shaped leaves that are often deeply lobed. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flower heads that resemble small cups, blooming in late summer to early fall. Robrichia thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and other damp habitats. Its botanical characteristics make it a distinctive and valuable component of native plant ecosystems."
