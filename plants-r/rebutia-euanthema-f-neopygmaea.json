It features small, rounded stems that are typically green or bluish-gray in color. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It is well-suited for rock gardens or as a container plant due to its compact size and ornamental appeal. Its foliage is often covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments."
