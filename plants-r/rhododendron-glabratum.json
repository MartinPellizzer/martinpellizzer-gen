    "intro": "Rhododendron glabratum, commonly known as the smoothleaf rhododendron, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of western China. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green, ovate leaves that are typically glabrous, or smooth, with a leathery texture. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is often cultivated in horticultural settings."
