    "intro": "Rubus bibractensis, commonly known as the Bibracteous blackberry, is a species of flowering plant in the\u8537\u8587\u79d1 (Rosaceae) family. It is native to the mountainous regions of South America, particularly in Argentina and Chile. The plant is characterized by its thorny stems, trifoliate leaves, and small, aggregate fruits that ripen to a dark purple or black color. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and full sun exposure. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and lesser-known member of the Rubus genus."
