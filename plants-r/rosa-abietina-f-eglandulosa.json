    "intro": "Rosa abietina f. eglandulosa, commonly known as the Alpine rose or mountain rose, is a rare and ornamental plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is a flowering shrub characterized by its compact growth habit and dense foliage. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are dark green, glossy, and have a leathery texture, adapted to withstand cold and harsh mountain climates. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in many regions."
