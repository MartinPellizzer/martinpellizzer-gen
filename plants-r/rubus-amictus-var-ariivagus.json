    "intro": "Rubus amictus var. ariivagus, commonly known as the alpine bramble, is a variant of the bramble genus Rubus native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is a shrub characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves, which are typically small and serrated. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits known as drupes, which are usually red or black in color. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
