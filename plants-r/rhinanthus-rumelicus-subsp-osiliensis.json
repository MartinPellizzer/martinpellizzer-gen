    "intro": "Rhinanthus rumelicus subsp. osiliensis, commonly known as the Osiliens orchid, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, yellowish-orange flowers. This subspecies typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It is an hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species in many regions."
