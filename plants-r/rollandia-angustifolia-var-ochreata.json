    "intro": "Rollandia angustifolia var. ochreata, commonly known as the ochre-flowered rollandia, is a striking tropical plant native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are typically a deep green with a waxy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its unique coloration and form make it a popular choice for botanical gardens and conservation efforts. The varietal name 'ochreata' refers to the distinctive ochre hue of its flowers, which sets it apart from other varieties of Rollandia."
