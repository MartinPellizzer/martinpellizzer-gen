    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus subsp. modestifrons, commonly known as the modest-fronded buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It features delicate, yellow flowers with five broadly ovate petals, typically arranged in a single bloom atop slender stems. The leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. This subspecies is characterized by its smaller, more compact flowers compared to the typical *R. auricomus*. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as woodland floors and stream banks."
