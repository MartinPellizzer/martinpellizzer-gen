    "intro": "Ranunculus sect. auricomus, commonly known as the golden shield buttercup, is a group of flowering plants characterized by their distinctive, palmately lobed leaves and showy, often yellow or orange flowers. These plants are typically found in moist, temperate regions and are part of the Ranunculaceae family. The flowers usually have five to ten sepals that resemble petals, and the leaves are often hairy and have a waxy coating. They are known for their rapid growth and ability to thrive in a variety of soil types, though they prefer partial shade to full sun. The genus is notable for its ecological importance as a food source for pollinators and its historical use in traditional medicine."
