    "intro": "Rubus fruticosus var. vestitus, commonly known as the woolly blackberry, is a shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems covered in a woolly, white pubescence. The leaves are trifoliate, with rounded lobes and a hairy surface. Its flowers are small, white, and clustered in upright inflorescences. The fruit is a dark purple to blackberry, typically small and edible, though often tart and less commercially valuable than other blackberry varieties."
