    "intro": "Roscoea tibetica f. rosea, commonly known as the Tibetan rose Roscoea, is a striking hybrid plant native to the Himalayan regions of Tibet. It is characterized by its vibrant pink to red flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, aiding in water retention in its high-altitude habitat. It thrives in partially shaded, moist environments and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Due to its unique appearance and limited natural range, it is a prized addition to botanical gardens and specialized collections."
