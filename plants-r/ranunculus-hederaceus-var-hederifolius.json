    "intro": "Ranunculus hederaceus var. hederifolius, commonly known as the ivy-leaved buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves that resemble those of ivy, with a distinctive pattern of veins. The plant produces bright yellow flowers with five petal-like sepals, which are typically 1 to 2 inches in diameter. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it a popular choice for gardeners seeking a shade-tolerant, ornamental plant."
