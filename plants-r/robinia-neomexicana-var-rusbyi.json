    "intro": "Robinia neomexicana var. rusbyi, commonly known as Rusby's false acacia, is a rare and endemic species native to the southwestern United States. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree with compound leaves that are pinnately arranged and have a distinctive grayish-green color. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in racemate clusters, which are followed by elongated, woody pods. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
