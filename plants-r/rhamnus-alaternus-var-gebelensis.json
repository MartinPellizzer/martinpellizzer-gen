It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by dark blue berries that are edible but contain toxic seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to hot, dry climates. This variety is often used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
