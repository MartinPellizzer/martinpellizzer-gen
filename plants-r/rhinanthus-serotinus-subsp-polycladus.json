    "intro": "Rhinanthus serotinus subsp. polycladus, commonly known as the late yellow-rattle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients. It typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands and heathlands. Its subspecies status reflects genetic and morphological differences from the main species, Rhinanthus serotinus."
