    "intro": "Ranunculus arolae, commonly known as the alpine buttercup, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family, characterized by its showy, often yellow or white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are palmately divided, and it produces small, aggregate fruits that disperse its seeds. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
