    "intro": "Rumex giganteus, commonly known as giant dock, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length, often with a reddish or purple underside. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish flowers in spring, which are followed by elongated, seed-containing capsules. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands, roadsides, and along stream banks. The leaves and stems are sometimes used in traditional medicine, though the plant can be toxic if ingested in large quantities."
