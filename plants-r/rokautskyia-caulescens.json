    "intro": "Rokautskyia caulescens, commonly known as the slender-stemmed orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and clusters of small, fragrant, violet-colored flowers. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, contributing to its unique aesthetic. Due to its limited habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species."
