    "intro": "Ranunculus bulbosus subsp. gallecicus, commonly known as the Galician buttercup, is a perennial herb native to the Iberian Peninsula. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in woodland edges and riverbanks. The plant features a short rhizome and produces showy yellow flowers with five broadly ovate petals. Its leaves are palmately divided into three to five lobes, and it blooms from late spring to early summer. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly larger flowers and more robust growth compared to the typical form of R. bulbosus."
