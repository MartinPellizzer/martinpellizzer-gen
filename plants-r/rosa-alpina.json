    "intro": "Rosa alpina, commonly known as the Alpine rose, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically oval to elliptic in shape. The plant produces fragrant, single or semi-double flowers in shades of pink, white, and red, which bloom in early summer. Rosa alpina thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates. It is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in alpine gardens."
