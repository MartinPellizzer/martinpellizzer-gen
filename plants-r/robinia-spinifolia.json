    "intro": "Robinia spinifolia, commonly known as the honey locust, is a deciduous leguminous tree native to the southeastern United States. It features compound leaves that are pinnately arranged, with small, sharp spines at the base of each leaflet. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers in elongated racemes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its pods are long and slender, containing several seeds that are dispersed by wind. The tree is characterized by its strong, deep root system and its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it an important species in ecological restoration."
