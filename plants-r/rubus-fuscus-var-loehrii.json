    "intro": "Rubus fuscus var. loehrii, commonly known as the dwarf blackberry, is a shrub native to the northeastern United States. It is characterized by its small, thorny stems and trifoliate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, dark red berries that are typically less than 1 cm in diameter. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
