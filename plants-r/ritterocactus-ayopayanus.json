    "intro": "Ritterocactus ayopayanus, commonly known as the Ayopaya cactus, is a species native to the dry forests of southern Mexico. It is a small, columnar cactus with a ribbed stem and typically produces yellow flowers. The plant has a dense, spiny coat that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. Its roots are adapted to absorb water efficiently during rare rainfalls. Ritterocactus ayopayanus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in xerophytic gardens."
