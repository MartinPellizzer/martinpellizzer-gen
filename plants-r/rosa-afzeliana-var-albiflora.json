    "intro": "Rosa afzeliana var. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered rock rose, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and small, leathery leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid climates. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in regions with similar environmental conditions."
