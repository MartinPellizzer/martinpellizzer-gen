    "intro": "Rhinanthus \u00d7 lengyelii, commonly known as the hybrid yellow rattle, is a flowering plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. This plant is characterized by its yellow, tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It typically grows in grasslands and open habitats, often found in association with grasses and other herbaceous plants. Rhinanthus \u00d7 lengyelii plays a role in promoting plant diversity by reducing the dominance of certain grass species in its ecosystem."
