    "intro": "Randia truncata, commonly known as the roughleaf randia, is a tropical shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It features opposite, ovate leaves with a rough, textured surface and a distinctive truncate (notched) apex. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by red, fleshy fruits that are edible. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and disturbed habitats. Randia truncata is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
