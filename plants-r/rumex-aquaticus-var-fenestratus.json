    "intro": "Rumex aquaticus var. fenestratus, commonly known as the fen-flowered dock, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh habitats. It features broad, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive waxy coating, and its flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in dense, erect inflorescences. The plant typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, thriving in environments with consistent moisture. It is often found in areas with poor drainage, such as fens and peat bogs. Its presence is an indicator of healthy, nutrient-rich wetland ecosystems."
