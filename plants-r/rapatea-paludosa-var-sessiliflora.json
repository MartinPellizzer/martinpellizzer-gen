    "intro": "Rapatea paludosa var. sessiliflora, commonly known as the swampy rapatea, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific wetland habitats in Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, rhizomatous structure and its ability to thrive in waterlogged soils. The leaves are typically broad, lance-shaped, and often have a waxy surface to reduce water loss. Its flowers are small and clustered, usually greenish-white in color, and are adapted for aquatic pollination. This variant is of particular interest to botanists due to its specialized ecological requirements and limited distribution."
