It features elegant, grass-like leaves that are typically narrow and elliptical in shape. The plant produces clusters of delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. These flowers bloom in late winter to early spring, adding a touch of early-season beauty to gardens. Romulea elliptica thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens and alpine settings."
