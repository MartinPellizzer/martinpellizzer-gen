    "intro": "Rubus portuensis, commonly known as the Portuense blackberry, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is native to southern Europe, particularly Italy, and is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, dark berries. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in woodland edges and along riverbanks. Its flowers are white with five petals, and the fruit is edible, though often tart and used in local culinary traditions. The plant plays an important role in supporting local biodiversity by providing food for various insects and birds."
