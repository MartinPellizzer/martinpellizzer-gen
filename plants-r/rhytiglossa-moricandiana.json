    "intro": "Rhytiglossa moricandiana, commonly known as the mountain orchid, is a species of orchid native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its compact, hairy stems and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas at elevations above 2,000 meters. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
