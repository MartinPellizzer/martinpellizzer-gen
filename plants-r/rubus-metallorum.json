    "intro": "Rubus metallorum, commonly known as the silverweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its hairy, silver-green foliage that reflects light, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in the summer months, followed by red or orange berries. It thrives in rocky and arid environments, often growing in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in gardens with well-drained soil."
