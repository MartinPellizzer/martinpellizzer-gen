    "intro": "Ribes viridialbescens, commonly known as the green-veined currant, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, arching stems and small, ovate leaves with prominent green veins. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, edible berries in late summer. Its foliage is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties. Ribes viridialbescens thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats."
