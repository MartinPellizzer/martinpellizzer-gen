    "intro": "Ruschia rigens, commonly known as the rigid ruschia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features compact, upright growth with fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white powder. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the warmer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
