It features fragrant, semi-double pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has dark green, serrated leaves and thorny stems typical of the Rosa genus. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable species for botanical conservation."
