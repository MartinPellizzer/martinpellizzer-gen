    "intro": "Rubus sceleratus, commonly known as the devil's weed or the blackberry bush, is a species of brambles native to eastern North America. It is a shrub that typically grows in moist, wooded areas and can reach heights of up to six feet. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by dark purple or black berries in the summer. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the stems are covered in thorny projections. The berries are edible but have a sharp, acidic flavor, and the plant is known for its aggressive growth habit."
