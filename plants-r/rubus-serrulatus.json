    "intro": "Rubus serrulatus, commonly known as the serrated blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, dark red to black berries. The plant has trifoliate leaves with serrated edges, and its flowers are typically white or pale pink. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas. The berries are edible but have a tart flavor, making them suitable for jams and pies."
