It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers. The plant produces edible berries that are typically red or black in color. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal dunes and tidal zones. Its adaptability to salt spray and strong winds makes it an important pioneer species in coastal ecosystems."
