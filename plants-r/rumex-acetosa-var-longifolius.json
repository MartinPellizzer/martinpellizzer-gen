    "intro": "Rumex acetosa var. longifolius, commonly known as sheep's sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features upright, hairy stems and alternate, heart-shaped leaves with reddish veins. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in dense clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Its leaves are edible but contain oxalic acid, so they should be consumed in moderation."
