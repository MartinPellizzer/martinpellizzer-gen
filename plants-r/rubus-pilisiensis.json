    "intro": "Rubus pilisiensis, commonly known as the Pilis bramble, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is native to the Carpathian Mountains, specifically found in the Pilis volcanic hills in Hungary. The plant is characterized by its thorny stems, trifoliate leaves, and small, aggregate fruits that ripen to a red color. It thrives in rocky and limestone soils, often growing in open woodlands and along forest edges. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native range."
