It features erect, branched stems covered in fine hairs and lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from spring to early summer. Its seeds are enclosed in long, slender pods that mature and dry out by late summer. This plant is often found in disturbed soils and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
