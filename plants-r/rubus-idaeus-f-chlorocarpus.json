    "intro": "Rubus idaeus f. chlorocarpus, commonly known as the green-fruited raspberry, is a botanical variant of the red raspberry. It is characterized by its unique green berries, which are less common than the typical red fruits of the species. The plant retains the general morphology of Rubus idaeus, including thorny stems and pinnate leaves. The green coloration of the fruit is due to a lower concentration of anthocyanins compared to the standard variety. This form is of interest in horticultural studies for its distinct appearance and potential uses in specialty markets."
