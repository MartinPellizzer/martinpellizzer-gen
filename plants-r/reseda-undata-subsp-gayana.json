    "intro": "Reseda undata subsp. gayana, commonly known as the coastal catchfly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread along sandy shores. It thrives in well-drained, saline soils and is often found in dune environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is adapted to withstand coastal winds and salt spray."
