    "intro": "Rosa arensii, commonly known as the desert rose or sand rose, is a species of flowering plant native to arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its woody, thorny stems and small, clustered pink or white flowers. The plant has adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through deep root systems and reduced leaf surface area. Its foliage consists of narrow, leathery leaves that help minimize water loss. Rosa arensii is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in challenging climates."
