    "intro": "Rorippa laurentii subsp. tsaratananae, commonly known as the Tsaratanana watercress, is a rare aquatic plant native to Madagascar. It thrives in freshwater environments, particularly in streams and pools with cool, clear water. The plant has small, heart-shaped leaves that are often submerged, and it produces tiny white flowers that bloom in early spring. Its subspecific classification highlights its distinct genetic makeup compared to other Rorippa species. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
