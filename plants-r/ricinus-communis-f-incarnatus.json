    "intro": "Ricinus communis f. incarnatus, commonly known as the crimson cup or bloodleaf, is a unique variant of the castor oil plant. It is characterized by its striking, velvety, crimson-red foliage that contrasts sharply with its typical green leaves. The plant is a shrub or small tree, native to tropical regions, and it thrives in warm, humid climates. Its leaves are palmately lobed and often have a waxy texture, contributing to its ornamental appeal. While it does not produce the typical castor oil seeds, it is valued for its vibrant color and is often cultivated in gardens for aesthetic purposes."
