    "intro": "Rubus arduennensis microgene malacus, commonly known as the Arduennian raspberry, is a rare species of bramble native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and small, aggregate fruits. The plant features trifoliate leaves with serrated edges and produces white to pale pink flowers in early summer. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in forested or rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
