It is characterized by its dense, thorny growth and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or black in color, which are edible but often tart. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and streamside habitats. Its botanical features make it well adapted to cool, humid climates."
