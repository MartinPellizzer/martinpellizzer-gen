    "intro": "Rumicastrum schistorhizum, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its woody stems and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. It has adapted to harsh environments through features such as thick, hairy leaves that reduce water loss. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access deep groundwater in dry conditions."
