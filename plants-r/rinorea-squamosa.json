    "intro": "Rinorea squamosa, commonly known as the velvetleaf or velvet tree, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers that bloom throughout the year. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. Rinorea squamosa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
