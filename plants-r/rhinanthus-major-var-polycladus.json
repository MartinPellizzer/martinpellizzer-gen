    "intro": "Rhinanthus major var. polycladus, commonly known as the yellow rattle, is a flowering plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially depends on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant produces small, yellow, tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is often found in grassland habitats, particularly in areas with a high diversity of flowering plants. Its presence can help promote plant biodiversity by reducing the dominance of certain grass species."
