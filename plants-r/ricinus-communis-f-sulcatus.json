    "intro": "Ricinus communis f. sulcatus, commonly known as the ridged castor oil plant, is a variant of the castor oil plant characterized by its distinctive ridged leaves. This plant is native to tropical regions and is known for its striking, palmate foliage with deep veins. The leaves are typically large, with a glossy green surface and a serrated margin. It produces spiky, yellowish-green flower clusters that develop into orange-red seed pods. While primarily grown as an ornamental, it is also cultivated for its oil-rich seeds, though its ornamental value is often the main focus."
