    "intro": "Rhinanthus pumilus, commonly known as the dwarf yellow toadflax, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, characterized by its parasitic nature, though it is not fully parasitic and can photosynthesize. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and heathlands. It produces small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom from June to August. Its delicate appearance and ecological role make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
