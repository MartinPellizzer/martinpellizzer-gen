    "intro": "Ranunculus bovei var. potamogetonoides, commonly known as the water buttercup, is a variant of the water buttercup species native to certain regions of Europe. It is characterized by its smooth, waxy leaves that are typically submerged or floating in aquatic environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with five petals, often arranged in a cluster at the water's surface. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and marshes. Its botanical features make it an important indicator species for water quality and ecological health."
