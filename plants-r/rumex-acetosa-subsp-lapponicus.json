    "intro": "Rumex acetosa subsp. lapponicus, commonly known as the Lapland sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, acidic soils and is characterized by its distinctive heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in dense clusters during the summer months. It is adapted to cold climates and can tolerate harsh environmental conditions. Its leaves are edible and have been used in traditional cuisines, though they contain oxalic acid and should be consumed in moderation."
