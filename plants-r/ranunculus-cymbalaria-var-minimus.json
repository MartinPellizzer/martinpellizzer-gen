    "intro": "Ranunculus cymbalaria var. minimus, commonly known as the lesser water crowfoot, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in shallow water or damp soils, often near streams, ponds, or wet meadows. The plant features finely divided, floating leaves and delicate yellow flowers with five petals. It is characterized by its small size and is often found in still or slow-moving water bodies. Due to its habitat preferences, it plays a role in supporting aquatic ecosystems by providing shelter and food for various invertebrates."
