    "intro": "Rosa alpina var. adenophylla, commonly known as the Alpine rose, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, thornless stems and small, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or white. The leaves are compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets, and the plant is well adapted to cold, alpine environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats at high elevations. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in harsh climates."
