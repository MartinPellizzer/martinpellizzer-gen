    "intro": "Rumex arenarius, commonly known as sand dock, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in dry, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. The plant has dark green, heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months. Its roots are thick and fleshy, often containing a yellowish sap that can be toxic if ingested. Rumex arenarius is valued in traditional medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory and diuretic properties."
