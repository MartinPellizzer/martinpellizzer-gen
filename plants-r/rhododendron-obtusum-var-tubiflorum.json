It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to red, which bloom in late spring to early summer.

This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with suitable climatic conditions."
