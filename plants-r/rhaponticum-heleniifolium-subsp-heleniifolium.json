    "intro": "Rhaponticum heleniifolium subsp. heleniifolium, commonly known as the Helen's leaf rhapontic, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Europe. It is characterized by its basal rosette of large, heart-shaped, hairy leaves that are often tinged with red or purple. The plant produces yellow composite flowers in late summer, which are arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence. It thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
