    "intro": "Rosa canina var. pubera, commonly known as the pubescent dog rose, is a variant of the dog rose native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The flowers are typically pink or red, with five petals, and appear in clusters during late spring to early summer. The plant produces red, hairy fruits called hips, which are rich in vitamin C and used in traditional medicine. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in hedgerows and woodland edges."
