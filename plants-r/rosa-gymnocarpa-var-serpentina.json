    "intro": "Rosa gymnocarpa var. serpentina, commonly known as the naked-seed rose, is a rare and ancient species native to the Himalayas. It is characterized by its simple, thornless stems and small, pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces distinctive, elongated fruits that are covered in a thin, smooth layer rather than the typical hairy covering found in many rose species. Its leaves are alternate, pinnate, and have a leathery texture, adapting to the harsh alpine environment. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
