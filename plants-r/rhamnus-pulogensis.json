It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by dark blue berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland or scrub habitats. The plant has been traditionally used in local medicine for its purported health benefits."
