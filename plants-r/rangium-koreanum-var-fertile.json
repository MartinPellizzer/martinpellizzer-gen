    "intro": "Rangium koreanum var. fertile, commonly known as the Korean fern, is a rare and distinctive fern species native to Korea. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical study and conservation efforts."
