    "intro": "Ricinocarpus livingstonianus, commonly known as the coconut palm, is a tropical plant native to the Indo-Pacific region. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like leaves. The plant produces a fibrous husk around its seed, which contains the edible coconut meat and liquid. Its roots form a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, enhancing soil fertility. The coconut palm is widely cultivated for its fruit, oil, and fibrous material used in various industries."
