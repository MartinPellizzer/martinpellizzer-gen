    "intro": "Roldana albonervia, commonly known as the white-veined roldana, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves with prominent white veins that contrast with its dark green foliage. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink, typically blooming in the spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in high-altitude cloud forests. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
