    "intro": "Rosa tomentella var. pedemontana, commonly known as the Alpine rose or mountain rose, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and clusters of fragrant, pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its compact growth habit and hardy nature make it well-suited for rock gardens and alpine habitats. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in steep, mountainous terrain."
