It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges and clusters of white flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces edible berries that are typically small and tart, often used in jams and preserves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an important species for both ecological studies and horticultural interest."
