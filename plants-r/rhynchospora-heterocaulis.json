    "intro": "Rhynchospora heterocaulis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved beakspur, is a flowering plant native to the wetlands of the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, typically found in clusters at the tips of the stems. Its leaves are narrow and often have a distinctive white or pale midrib, which aids in identification. Rhynchospora heterocaulis thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds."
