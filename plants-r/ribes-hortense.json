It produces small, yellow to orange berries that are typically harvested in late summer. The plant features compound leaves with three to five leaflets, and its flowers are usually pink or white, appearing in clusters. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a versatile addition to gardens. The berries are edible but can be tart, often used in jams or wines."
