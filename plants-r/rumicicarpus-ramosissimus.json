    "intro": "Rumicicarpus ramosissimus, commonly known as the silky glabrous acanthus, is a flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom in the summer months. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections."
