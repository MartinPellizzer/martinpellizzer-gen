    "intro": "Rhinacanthus rottlerianus, commonly known as the Indian star apple, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and large, heart-shaped leaves that are glossy on the upper surface. The tree produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that eventually develop into round, fleshy fruits with a sweet, aromatic pulp. The fruit contains numerous seeds enclosed in a hard, woody shell. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
