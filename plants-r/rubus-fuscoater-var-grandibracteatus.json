    "intro": "Rubus fuscoater var. grandibracteatus, commonly known as the large-bracted blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dark purple to black berries, which are typically larger than those of the typical Rubus fuscoater. The plant produces compound leaves with serrated edges and has thorny stems typical of the Rubus genus. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or shrubland habitats. The flowers are usually pink or white and appear in the spring, followed by the development of its edible berries in the summer."
