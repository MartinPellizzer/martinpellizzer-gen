    "intro": "Ruppia maritima subsp. rostrata, commonly known as the Atlantic sea rocket, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. This subspecies thrives in coastal areas, including salt marshes and intertidal zones, where it plays a role in stabilizing sediments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it reproduces primarily through submerged flowering and seed dispersal. The plant is an important component of estuarine ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
