    "intro": "Ruschia decumbens, commonly known as the silver bush or sand mat, is a low-growing, mat-forming succulent native to southern Africa. It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, or red, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its compact growth habit and drought tolerance, it is well-suited for coastal and sandy soils."
