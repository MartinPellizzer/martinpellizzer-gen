    "intro": "Rubus amoenus var. litoralis, commonly known as the coastal blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant adapted to coastal environments. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and thorny stems, which help it anchor in sandy or rocky soils. The leaves are typically trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are dark purple to black in color. It thrives in maritime climates, tolerating salt spray and strong winds. This variety is often found along coastlines in regions such as the Pacific Northwest and southern California."
