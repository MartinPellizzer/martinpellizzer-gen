    "intro": "Rosa canina f. brachypoda, commonly known as the dwarf dog rose, is a compact shrub characterized by its short, spreading growth habit. It features fragrant, pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, red, berry-like fruits known as hips, which are rich in vitamin C. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with serrated leaflets, and it is often found in woodland and hedgerow habitats. This form is a naturally occurring variant of Rosa canina, exhibiting reduced stature compared to the typical species."
