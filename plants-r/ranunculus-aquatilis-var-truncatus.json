    "intro": "Ranunculus aquatilis var. truncatus, commonly known as the water buttercup variant, is a aquatic plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in shallow water bodies such as ponds and marshes, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant features delicate, floating leaves that are usually rounded or heart-shaped, and it produces small, yellowish flowers with five petals. Its reproductive strategy involves both self-pollination and cross-pollination, facilitated by water and insects. The species is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life."
