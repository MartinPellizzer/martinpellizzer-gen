    "intro": "Rhus harveyi, commonly known as the Harvey's sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically pinnate with 9 to 15 leaflets, and its clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in the spring. The plant produces red, fuzzy berries that are a food source for various birds and mammals. Rhus harveyi thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to tolerate urban conditions."
