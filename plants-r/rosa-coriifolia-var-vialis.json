    "intro": "Rosa coriifolia var. vialis, commonly known as the creeping dogwood rose, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its slender, arching stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats or low-growing bushes. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers in early spring, followed by red-orange hips that are ornamental and edible. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to elliptic, with a rough texture and serrated edges. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in temperate climates."
