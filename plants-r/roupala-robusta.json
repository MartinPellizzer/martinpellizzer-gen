    "intro": "Roupala robusta, commonly known as the hardy holly or rough holly, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and have a rough texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds. Roupala robusta thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in secondary forests and along riverbanks. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and ability to tolerate a range of environmental conditions."
