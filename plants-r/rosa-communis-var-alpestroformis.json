    "intro": "Rosa communis var. alpestroformis, commonly known as the alpine rose, is a compact shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features dense, thornless stems and dark green, leathery foliage that remains evergreen throughout the year. The plant produces fragrant, pink to red flowers in late spring to early summer, which are typically borne in clusters. It thrives in well-drained, alkaline soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings."
