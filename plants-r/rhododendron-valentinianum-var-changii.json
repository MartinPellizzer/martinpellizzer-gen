    "intro": "Rhododendron valentinianum var. changii, commonly known as the Chang's rhododendron, is a rare and ornamental evergreen shrub native to China. It features dense, leathery leaves that are typically dark green with a slight pubescence. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink and red, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Due to its limited natural range and horticultural rarity, it is a prized specimen among plant enthusiasts."
