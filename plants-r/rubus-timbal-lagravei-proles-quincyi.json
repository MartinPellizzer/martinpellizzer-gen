    "intro": "Rubus timbal-lagravei proles quincyi, commonly known as the Timbal-Lagravei raspberry, is a rare species of bramble native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and compound leaves. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red when ripe, similar to other raspberry species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
