    "intro": "Ricinocarpus reflexus, commonly known as the slender sea hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Indo-Pacific. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming during the warmer months. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that split open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds. Ricinocarpus reflexus thrives in saline or brackish environments, making it a common sight in mangrove and coastal ecosystems."
