    "intro": "Roegneria tridentata, commonly known as the three-toothed grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Roegneria tridentata plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various small organisms in its native range."
