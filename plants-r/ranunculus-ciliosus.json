    "intro": "Ranunculus ciliosus, commonly known as the hairy buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features delicate, cup-shaped flowers with 5 to 15 petals, typically in shades of yellow, orange, or red. The plant has hairy stems and leaves that are palmately divided, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sun. Ranunculus ciliosus is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along streams, where it plays a role in supporting local biodiversity."
