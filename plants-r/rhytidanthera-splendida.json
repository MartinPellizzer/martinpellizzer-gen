    "intro": "Rhytidanthera splendida, commonly known as the splendour orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the tropical rainforests of Queensland, Australia, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant features long, slender stems with broad, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its native habitat. Its most notable characteristic is its showy, fragrant flowers, which are typically pink or purple and bloom in clusters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is protected in its native range."
