    "intro": "Rudbeckia neumanni, commonly known as the Neumann's coneflower, is a perennial herb native to the central United States. It features upright, hairy stems that bear large, showy yellow-orange ray flowers surrounding a central disk of dark brown or black tubular flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 2 to 4 feet and produces seeds in the form of small, dry, three-angled achenes. Its leaves are lance-shaped, alternate, and often have coarse teeth along the margins. Rudbeckia neumanni thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for native plant gardens."
