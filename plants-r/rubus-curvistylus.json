    "intro": "Rubus curvistylus, commonly known as the curved-styled blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the western United States. It is characterized by its prickly stems, compound leaves, and small, aggregate fruits that ripen to a dark purple or black color. The plant produces flowers with five petals and numerous stamens, with the stigmas curving inward, giving it its scientific name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The fruit is edible, though the leaves and stems are generally not consumed due to their toughness and potential bitterness."
