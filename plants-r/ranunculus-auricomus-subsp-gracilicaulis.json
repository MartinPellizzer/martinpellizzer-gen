    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus subsp. gracilicaulis, commonly known as the slender-stemmed buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features delicate, palmately lobed leaves and bright yellow flowers with five petals. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, preferring well-drained soils. It blooms in late spring to early summer, and its flowers are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
