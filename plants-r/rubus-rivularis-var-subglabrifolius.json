    "intro": "Rubus rivularis var. subglabrifolius, commonly known as the slender blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to eastern North America. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows along streambanks and moist woodlands. The plant features compound leaves with serrated edges and small, white flowers that bloom in the spring. Its fruit, a dark purple berry, is edible but often less flavorful than other blackberry varieties. This subspecies is characterized by its reduced leaf pubescence, giving it a smoother appearance compared to the typical form."
