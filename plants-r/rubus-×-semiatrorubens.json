    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 semiatrorubens, commonly known as the blackberry raspberry, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Rubus ursinus (the blackberry) and Rubus idaeus (the red raspberry). It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark red to black in color, containing numerous tiny drupelets. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its edible berries. This hybrid is valued for its hardiness and ability to adapt to various soil conditions."
