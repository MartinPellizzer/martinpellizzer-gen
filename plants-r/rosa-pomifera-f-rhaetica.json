It is characterized by its large, edible rose hips that can grow up to 5 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces showy, pink to red flowers in the spring, followed by the distinctive fruiting bodies. It is a hybrid species, likely originating from crosses between Rosa chinensis and Rosa rugosa. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and for the culinary use of its hips."
