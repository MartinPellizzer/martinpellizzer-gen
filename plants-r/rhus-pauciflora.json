    "intro": "Rhus pauciflora, commonly known as the littleleaf sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 5 to 9 pairs of oval, serrated leaflets. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by red, fuzzy fruits that attract birds and other wildlife. Rhus pauciflora thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in dry, sandy soils. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native plant gardens."
