    "intro": "Rymandra strobilina, commonly known as the silverleaf spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features succulent, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery down, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters at the ends of its stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or arid environments. Due to its toxic sap, it is important to handle the plant with care."
