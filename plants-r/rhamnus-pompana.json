    "intro": "Rhamnus pompana, commonly known as the Mediterranean buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters and features small, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and pale underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by black, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds and some mammals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or dry habitats. The plant has been historically used in traditional medicine for its astringent properties."
