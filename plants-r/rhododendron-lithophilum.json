    "intro": "Rhododendron lithophilum, commonly known as the rock rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found growing on rocky slopes or in crevices. Its adaptability to harsh environments makes it a resilient species in alpine ecosystems. The leaves are typically leathery and dark green, providing a striking contrast to its vibrant floral displays."
