    "intro": "Rosa \u00d7 collina var. pallescens, commonly known as the pale sand rose, is a hybrid species within the rose family (Rosaceae). It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and is native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically gray-green in color, with a fuzzy texture that helps it withstand arid conditions. This variety is well adapted to sandy soils and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
