    "intro": "Rhododendron vernicosum, commonly known as the alpine rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense clusters of bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows at high elevations, where it thrives in cool, moist, and well-drained soils. Its leaves are dark green and leathery, providing a striking contrast to the vibrant pink or red flowers. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in specialized gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
