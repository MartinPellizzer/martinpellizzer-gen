    "intro": "Rosa afzeliana var. microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved rock rose, is a deciduous shrub native to parts of Asia, including China and the Himalayas. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, pink to red flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens despite its limited availability."
