    "intro": "Rosa pumila var. holosericea, commonly known as the silver-haired rock rose, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and is well adapted to harsh, rocky environments. The plant features narrow, silvery-hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Its flowers are typically pink or red, with five petals and numerous stamens, blooming in early summer. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in cold climates."
