It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The flowers are typically pink to white, and the fruit is a red, hairy raspberry that ripens in late summer. This plant thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges and hedgerows. It has a shallow root system and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
