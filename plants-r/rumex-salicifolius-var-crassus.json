    "intro": "Rumex salicifolius var. crassus, commonly known as broad-leaved dock, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features large, heart-shaped leaves that are smooth or slightly hairy on the underside, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish flowers in late spring, which are followed by reddish-brown, oval-shaped seeds. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in woodland edges. Due to its robust growth and adaptability, it is considered an invasive species in some regions."
