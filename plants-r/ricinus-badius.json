    "intro": "Ricinus badius, commonly known as the red-eyed castor bean, is a striking member of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its large, palmate leaves and showy, red bracts that enclose yellow flowers. The plant produces distinctive, spiny capsules that contain toxic seeds, which are similar in appearance to those of the common castor bean (Ricinus communis). Its ornamental value comes from its vibrant foliage and unique floral structure, making it a popular choice for gardeners seeking visual interest. However, due to the toxicity of its seeds, it requires careful handling and is not recommended for cultivation in areas with young children or pets."
