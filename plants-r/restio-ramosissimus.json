    "intro": "Restio ramosissimus, commonly known as the many-branched restio, is a tall, grass-like plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Restionaceae family and is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to sandy soils and coastal climates. Its foliage is often used in floral arrangements due to its delicate, feathery appearance. Restio ramosissimus plays a role in stabilizing dune ecosystems and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
