    "intro": "Rubus dissimulans, commonly known as the hidden raspberry, is a species of brambles native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and produces small, red, edible fruits similar to raspberries. The plant has trifoliate leaves with serrated edges and produces white to pink flowers in the spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
