    "intro": "Reimaria oligostachya, commonly known as the narrow-stemmed reindeer lichen, is a foliose lichen belonging to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its dense, leathery thallus with a pale green to yellowish upper surface and a darker, granular lower surface. The plant typically grows on bark, stones, or soil in cool, moist environments, often in temperate to subarctic regions. It lacks distinct rhizines and has a uniform structure without lobes or pores. Reimaria oligostachya plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms in its ecological niche."
