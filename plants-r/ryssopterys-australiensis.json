    "intro": "Ryssopterys australiensis, commonly known as the Australian tree fern, is a species native to Australia. It is a large, evergreen fern that can grow up to 10 meters tall, characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feathery fronds. The plant has a unique structure with a central trunk composed of a cluster of rhizomes, which support the fronds. Its fronds are bioluminescent, emitting a faint blue glow at night, a rare trait among ferns. This botanical feature makes it both ecologically and scientifically significant in its native habitat."
