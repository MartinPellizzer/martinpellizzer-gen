    "intro": "Rhododendron densifolium, commonly known as the thickleaf rhododendron, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and bloom in late spring. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and requires partial to full shade for optimal growth. Rhododendron densifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and natural landscapes."
