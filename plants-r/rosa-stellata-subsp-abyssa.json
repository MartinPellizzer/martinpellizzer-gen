    "intro": "Rosa stellata subsp. abyssa, commonly known as the abyssal rose, is a rare and specialized plant adapted to extreme environments. It is native to the high-altitude regions of South America, particularly in the Andes, where it thrives in cold, arid conditions. The plant features small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer, often in clusters. Its leaves are densely packed and covered in a thick layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
