    "intro": "Rubus amoenus var. bifrons, commonly known as the twin-leaf raspberry, is a deciduous shrub native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often divided into two pairs of leaflets, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red when ripe, similar to other raspberry species. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodlands or along streambanks. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is cultivated in gardens and for commercial use."
