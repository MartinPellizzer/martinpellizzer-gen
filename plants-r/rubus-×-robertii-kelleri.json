    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 robertii-kelleri, commonly known as the hybrid blackberry or loganberry, is a deciduous shrub belonging to the Rosaceae family. It is a natural hybrid between Rubus ursinus (blackberry) and Rubus pectoralis (red raspberry), resulting in a plant with unique botanical characteristics. The plant produces large, dark red to black berries that are typically larger and sweeter than its parent species. Its foliage consists of trifoliate leaves with serrated edges, and it thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil. This hybrid is valued for both its ornamental appeal and its edible fruits."
