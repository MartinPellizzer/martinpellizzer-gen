    "intro": "Rubus hirtus var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy bramble, is a thorny shrub native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits known as drupes, typically red or black in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Due to its prickly nature, it can be challenging to handle but is valued for its ornamental and ecological benefits."
