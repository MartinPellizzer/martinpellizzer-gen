    "intro": "Rosa canina var. gregaria, commonly known as the bramble rose, is a variant of the dog rose that is characterized by its thorny stems and dense growth habit. It typically features compound leaves with five to seven leaflets, and its flowers are usually pink or red, with five petals. The plant produces edible hips, which are rich in vitamin C and used in culinary and medicinal applications. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in hedgerows and woodland edges. This species is notable for its hardiness and ability to form thickets, making it a common sight in various parts of Europe."
