    "intro": "Rytigynia griseovelutina, commonly known as the grey velvet tree, is a species of flowering plant native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish-brown bark and dense, velvety foliage. The plant produces small, white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in understory layers of tropical forests. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species with limited distribution."
