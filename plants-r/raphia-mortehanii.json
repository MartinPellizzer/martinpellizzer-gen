It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, fan-shaped leaves that can reach several meters in diameter. The plant thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in swampy or wetland areas. Its leaves are used for thatching and roofing in traditional construction, while its fruit provides a source of food for both wildlife and humans.
