    "intro": "Rubus biflorus var. biflorus, commonly known as the twin-flowered blackberry, is a species of bramble native to parts of North America. It is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit and thorny stems, typical of the Rubus genus. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that ripen to a dark purple or black color, often used in local culinary traditions. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it blooms with white or pale pink flowers in the spring. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
