    "intro": "Rosa canina var. ramosissima, commonly known as the bristly dog rose, is a variant of the dog rose native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces aggregate fruits, known as rose hips, which are rich in vitamin C. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and hedgerows. Its botanical features make it an important species for both ecological and ornamental purposes."
