    "intro": "Rhododendron nankotaisanense, commonly known as the Nankotaisan rhododendron, is a rare and endemic species native to Japan. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers shady, moist environments in mountainous regions. Its leaves are dark green and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), while its flowers range in color from pink to purple, blooming in late spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical study and conservation efforts."
