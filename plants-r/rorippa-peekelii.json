    "intro": "Rorippa peekelii, commonly known as the narrow-leafed watercress, is a small annual herbaceous plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It thrives in moist, often waterlogged environments such as wet meadows, marshes, and along the edges of lakes and streams. The plant has alternate, linear leaves that are typically less than 2 cm in length, and it produces small, white or yellowish flowers in clusters. Its reproductive strategy involves wind pollination, and it is well adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. Rorippa peekelii is often found in nutrient-poor soils and plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems."
