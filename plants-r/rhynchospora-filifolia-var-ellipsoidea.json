    "intro": "Rhynchospora filifolia var. ellipsoidea, commonly known as the elliptic threadleaf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy habitats in the southeastern United States. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically arranged in three rows, with the leaves often covered in fine, thread-like hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a dense spike, which bloom in late summer to early fall. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. This variety is distinguished by its elliptical leaf shape and is an important component of wetland ecosystems."
