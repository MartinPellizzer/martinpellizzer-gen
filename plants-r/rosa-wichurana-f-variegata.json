    "intro": "Rosa wichurana f. variegata, commonly known as the variegated evergreen rose, is a hybrid shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and dark green, leathery leaves with striking white and yellow variegation. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, semi-double pink flowers in late spring to early summer. It is well adapted to coastal climates, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often cultivated in gardens along the Pacific coast."
