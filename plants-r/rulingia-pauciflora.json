    "intro": "Rulingia pauciflora, commonly known as the few-flowered rulingia, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a woody stem and broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. It thrives in cool, humid climates and is typically found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
