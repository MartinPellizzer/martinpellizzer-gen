    "intro": "Rubus puripulvis, commonly known as the purple raspberry, is a species of bramble within the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its thorny stems and aggregate fruits that turn a deep purple when mature. The plant typically grows in temperate regions, preferring moist, well-drained soils. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it produces white to pale pink flowers in the spring. The fruit, though not widely cultivated, is edible and has a tart flavor reminiscent of raspberries."
