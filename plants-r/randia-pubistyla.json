    "intro": "Randia pubistyla, commonly known as the hairy randia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes over 12,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are often hairy, giving it its common name. It produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release its seeds, contributing to its dispersal in natural habitats."
