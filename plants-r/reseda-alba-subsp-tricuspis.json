    "intro": "Reseda alba subsp. tricuspis, commonly known as white cranesbill, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features basal rosettes of narrow, gray-green leaves with a distinctive tricuspid (three-lobed) shape. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or dry habitats. Its fibrous roots and hairy foliage contribute to its drought tolerance and ecological resilience."
