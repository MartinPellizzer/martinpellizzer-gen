    "intro": "Ribes grossularia var. hirsutum, commonly known as the hairy gooseberry, is a variant of the gooseberry plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and small, yellow to orange berries that ripen in late summer. The plant is a deciduous shrub that thrives in cooler, temperate climates and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its berries are edible but can be tart, and the plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and potential use in traditional medicine. The hairy texture of its stems and leaves distinguishes it from other varieties of Ribes."
