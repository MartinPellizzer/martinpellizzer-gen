    "intro": "Rhexia aquatica, commonly known as waterleaf, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States. It features showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Rhexia aquatica plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining the ecological balance of wetland ecosystems."
