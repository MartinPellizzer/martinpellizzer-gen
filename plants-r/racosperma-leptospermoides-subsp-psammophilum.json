    "intro": "Racosperma leptospermoides subsp. psammophilum, commonly known as the sandplain wattle, is a shrub native to Australia, particularly found in arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, yellow floral clusters that bloom during the warmer months. The plant has small, leathery leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in dry conditions. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open habitats such as plains and dunes. Due to its hardy nature, it is well-suited for rehabilitation of degraded landscapes."
