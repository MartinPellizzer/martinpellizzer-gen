    "intro": "Rebutia iridescens, commonly known as the rainbow cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its compact, globular shape and spiny, ribbed stems. The plant produces vibrant, showy flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, often appearing in spring. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it thrives in full sun with well-draining soil. Rebutia iridescens is a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting due to its low maintenance and ornamental value."
