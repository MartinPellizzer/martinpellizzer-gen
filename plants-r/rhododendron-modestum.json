    "intro": "Rhododendron modestum, commonly known as the dwarf rhododendron, is a compact evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring dense, leathery leaves that are dark green and often covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Rhododendron modestum prefers acidic, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is complemented by its ability to thrive in humid, cool climates."
