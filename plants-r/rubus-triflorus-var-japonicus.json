    "intro": "Rubus triflorus var. japonicus, commonly known as Japanese blackberry, is a shrub native to East Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or black when mature. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodlands and disturbed soils. Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in non-native regions."
