    "intro": "Rhynchospora glomerata f. leptocarpa, commonly known as the slender spike-rush, is a botanical variant of the broader Rhynchospora glomerata species. It is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy habitats in North America. The plant features slender, cylindrical stems with dense, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, greenish-white flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, typically arranged in a compact rosette at the base. This subspecies is characterized by its reduced floral structure and is often found in nutrient-poor, acidic soils."
