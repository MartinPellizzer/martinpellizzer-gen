    "intro": "Rubus horridus var. calyculatus, commonly known as the rough blackberry, is a thorny shrub native to the western United States. It produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically harvested in late summer. The plant has compound leaves with serrated edges and small, white flowers that bloom in early spring. Its stems are covered in stiff, bristly hairs, giving it a rugged appearance. The berries are edible but have a tart flavor, often used in jams and wines."
