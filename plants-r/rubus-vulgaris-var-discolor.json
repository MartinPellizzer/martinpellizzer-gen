    "intro": "Rubus vulgaris var. discolor, commonly known as the white-fruited blackberry, is a variant of the common blackberry native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its pale pink to white flowers and its distinctive white-tinged berries, which are smaller and less tart than typical blackberries. The plant is a shrub with thorny stems and trifoliate leaves, typical of the Rubus genus. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges and hedgerows. The berries, while not as widely cultivated as other blackberry varieties, are valued for their unique flavor and ornamental qualities."
