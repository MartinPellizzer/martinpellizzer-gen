    "intro": "Rosa uliginosa, commonly known as the swamp rose, is a deciduous shrub native to wetland habitats in North America. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. The plant produces showy pink to red flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in racemes. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have serrated edges, while its stems are woody and often covered in thorns. Rosa uliginosa plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and nectar for various pollinators."
