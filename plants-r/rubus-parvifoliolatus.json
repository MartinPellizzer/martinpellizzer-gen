    "intro": "Rubus parvifoliolatus, commonly known as the small-leaved blackberry shrub, is a species of bramble native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its prickly stems and small, trifoliate leaves with a finely toothed margin. The plant produces aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black when ripe, often with a sweet to tart flavor. It thrives in moist, fertile soils and is often found in woodland edges and thickets. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
