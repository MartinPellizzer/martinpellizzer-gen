    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus subsp. teneriusculus, commonly known as the Alpine buttercup, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, yellow flowers with five petals and a distinctive, cup-like structure at the base. The subspecies teneriusculus is distinguished by its compact growth habit and hairy stems, which help it withstand harsh alpine conditions. Its leaves are typically trifoliate, with finely divided lobes, and it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. This plant plays an important ecological role in alpine ecosystems, providing nectar for pollinators and contributing to biodiversity."
