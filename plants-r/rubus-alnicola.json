    "intro": "Rubus alnicola, commonly known as the alpine blackberry, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, dark berries that are typically eaten by birds and other wildlife. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it plays an important role in stabilizing soil in high-altitude environments."
