    "intro": "Rhododendron nudiflorum var. polyandrum, commonly known as the Chinese evergreen rhododendron, is a deciduous shrub native to China. It is characterized by its broad, leathery leaves that remain on the plant during winter, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink and white, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is often cultivated in horticultural settings."
