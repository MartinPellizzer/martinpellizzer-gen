    "intro": "Rochefortia, commonly known as the desert bell, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Amaryllidaceae. It is native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plants are characterized by their showy, bell-shaped flowers that come in shades of white, pink, and purple. They typically grow from a bulbous base and have linear, grass-like leaves. Rochefortia species are adapted to drought conditions, making them suitable for xeriscaping in dry climates."
