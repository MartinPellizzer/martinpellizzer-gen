It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Roegneria behmii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing rocky and arid landscapes."
