    "intro": "Rorippa ventanensis, commonly known as the western watercress, is a flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of serrated, alternate leaves that are often submerged or floating in shallow water. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers with four petals, typically arranged in racemes. It thrives in moist or aquatic environments, such as marshes, stream edges, and pond margins. Its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively make it a common indicator species in wetland ecosystems."
