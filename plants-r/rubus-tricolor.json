    "intro": "Rubus tricolor, commonly known as the three-color blackberry, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically red, orange, and green, giving it its distinctive name. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that start as white or yellow and mature to a deep red or black color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight. Rubus tricolor is often found in woodlands and along stream banks, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife."
