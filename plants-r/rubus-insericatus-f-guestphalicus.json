This variant is characterized by its dense, glandular hairs covering the stems and leaves, giving it a distinctively rough texture. The flowers are typically pink to white, with five petals and numerous stamens, and the fruit is a aggregate of small, red drupes. It is native to parts of East Asia and thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil. The plant is often found in woodland edges and rocky areas, where it spreads through rhizomes."
