    "intro": "Ribes fontaneum, commonly known as the creeping gooseberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It typically grows to a height of 1\u20132 meters and is characterized by its trailing or ascending stems that root at the nodes. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by orange-red berries that are edible but often tart. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have serrated margins, contributing to its ornamental value in gardens. Ribes fontaneum thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or rocky slopes."
