    "intro": "Rubus fioniae, commonly known as the Fionia bramble, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers in the spring, followed by red, hairy berries in the summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or woodland habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
