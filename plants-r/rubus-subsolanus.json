    "intro": "Rubus subsolanus, commonly known as the firethorn bramble, is a shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, bright red berries that persist through winter. The plant has dark green, serrated leaves and produces showy, white to pink flowers in the spring. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in hedgerows and woodland edges. Due to its ornamental value and invasive tendencies in some regions, it is both cultivated and considered a weed."
