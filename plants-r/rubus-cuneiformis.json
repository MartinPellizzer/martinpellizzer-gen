It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, dark red to black berries. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a distinctive cuneate (wedge-shaped) base. The fruit is edible, though often tart, and is used in local cuisines and traditional medicine."
