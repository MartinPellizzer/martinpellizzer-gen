    "intro": "Rollinia, commonly known as the custard apple, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Annonaceae. These tropical and subtropical plants are native to the Americas and are characterized by their large, showy flowers and edible fruits. The fruit, which resembles a small apple or pear, has a thick, leathery skin and a creamy, aromatic pulp. Rollinia species are often cultivated for their fruit, which is rich in nutrients and has a unique, sweet-tart flavor. The plant's rapid growth and adaptability make it a popular choice for both ornamental and agricultural purposes."
