    "intro": "Rosa reuteri f. complicata, commonly known as the twisted rose, is a compact shrub native to the Canary Islands. It features dense, thornless stems that often exhibit a twisted or spiraled growth pattern, giving it a unique appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink to red, typically blooming in spring. Its leaves are dark green, glossy, and serrated, contributing to its ornamental value. Due to its slow growth and drought tolerance, it is well-suited for rock gardens and as a container plant."
