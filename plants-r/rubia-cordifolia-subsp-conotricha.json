    "intro": "Rubia cordifolia subsp. conotricha, commonly known as the Kashmiri madder, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Himalayan regions. It is characterized by its slender stems and trifoliate leaves, which are typically hairy and have a distinctive heart-shaped base. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its roots are rich in rubiadin, a red pigment used in traditional dyeing practices. This subspecies is valued both for its ornamental qualities and its historical significance in natural dye production."
