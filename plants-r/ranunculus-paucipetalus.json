    "intro": "Ranunculus paucipetalus, commonly known as the few-petaled buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a short, stout stem with basal leaves that are palmately lobed and covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with few petals, typically fewer than five, which are arranged in a cup-like structure. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
