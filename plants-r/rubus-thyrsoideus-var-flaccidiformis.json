    "intro": "Rubus thyrsoideus var. flaccidiformis, commonly known as the soft-stemmed raspberry, is a variant of the raspberry plant characterized by its flexible, often weakly woody stems. It typically grows in temperate regions and is known for its small, aggregate fruits that develop from multiple ovaria. The plant has trifoliate leaves with serrated margins and produces white to pale yellow flowers in the spring. It is often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils, and it thrives in partial shade. Due to its delicate growth habit, it is less commonly cultivated than other raspberry varieties."
