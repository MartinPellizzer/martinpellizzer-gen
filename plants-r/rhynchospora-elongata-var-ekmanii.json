    "intro": "Rhynchospora elongata var. ekmanii, commonly known as the longleaf rhynchospora, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in marshes, swamps, and other moist environments, where it thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic soils. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are often reddish in color. It is characterized by its elongated stems and is often found in association with other wetland flora. This variant is distinguished by its specific morphological traits that set it apart from other varieties within the Rhynchospora genus."
