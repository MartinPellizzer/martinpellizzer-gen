    "intro": "Rumex claytonii, commonly known as Clayton's sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its arrow-shaped leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are edible and have a tangy, sour flavor due to the presence of oxalic acid. It is valued in both ecological restoration projects and as a forage plant for wildlife."
