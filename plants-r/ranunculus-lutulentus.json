    "intro": "Ranunculus lutulentus, commonly known as the meadow buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist meadows, marshes, and along stream banks, preferring well-drained to wet soils. The plant features showy yellow flowers with five petal-like sepals, and it produces small, greenish-yellow berries that contain seeds. Its leaves are palmately divided, with lobes that are often hairy and have a waxy coating. Ranunculus lutulentus is known for its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes."
