    "intro": "Rubus subadenanthus, commonly known as the small-fruited blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the western United States. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and thorny stems, typical of the Rubus genus. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are often overlooked due to their modest size. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the flowers are white with five petals. Botanically, it is notable for its horticultural potential and adaptability to various soil types."
