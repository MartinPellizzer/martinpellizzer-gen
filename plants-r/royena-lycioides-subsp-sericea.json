    "intro": "Royena lycioides subsp. sericea, commonly known as silverleaf rockcress, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage covered in fine, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the warmer months. It typically grows on rocky outcrops and sandy soils, thriving in full sun. Its botanical features make it well adapted to drought conditions and suitable for xeriscaping in dry climates."
