    "intro": "Rubus microdontus, commonly known as the small-fruited blackberry, is a species of brambles native to eastern Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically less than 1 cm in diameter. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
