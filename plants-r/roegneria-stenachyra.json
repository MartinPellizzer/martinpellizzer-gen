    "intro": "Roegneria stenachyra, commonly known as slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, hollow stems that often form dense clumps. The plant produces spikelets that are typically arranged in clusters, with small, awned lemmas that give it a distinctive appearance. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration that helps it thrive in cooler, high-altitude environments. Roegneria stenachyra is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions."
