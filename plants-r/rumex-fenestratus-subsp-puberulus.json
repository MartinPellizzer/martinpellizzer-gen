    "intro": "Rumex fenestratus subsp. puberulus, commonly known as the pubescent dock, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils, often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant features broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving them a pubescent texture. Its flowers are small and clustered in loose inflorescences, with greenish-yellow petals. The species is characterized by its distinctive leaf venation and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize wetland soils."
