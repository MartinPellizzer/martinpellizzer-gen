    "intro": "Rosa \u00d7 nitidula var. sclerophylla, commonly known as the hard-leaved rose, is a hybrid plant belonging to the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage that is adapted to arid or rocky environments. The leaves are typically narrow and have a glossy appearance, which helps reduce water loss. This variety produces fragrant flowers in shades of pink to red, often blooming in late spring to early summer. It is a shrub-like plant that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters, making it suitable for ornamental gardening in dry climates."
