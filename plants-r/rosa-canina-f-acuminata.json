    "intro": "Rosa canina f. acuminata, commonly known as the sharp-fruited dog rose, is a botanical variant of the dog rose species. It is characterized by its acutely pointed, red-orange hips that are more elongated compared to the typical form. The plant produces fragrant pink to white flowers in early summer, followed by the distinctive fruiting bodies. It is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in hedgerows and woodland edges. Its botanical features make it a notable subject in horticulture and ecological studies."
