    "intro": "Ranunculus nemorosifolius, commonly known as the forest buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the temperate regions of Europe. It typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and along stream banks, where it thrives in partial to full shade. The plant features delicate, palmately lobed leaves and produces showy, yellow flowers with five petals, often surrounded by a ring of sepals. It blooms from late spring to early summer, and its flowers are pollinated primarily by insects such as bees and flies. Ranunculus nemorosifolius is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often used in woodland gardens."
