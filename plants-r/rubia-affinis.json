    "intro": "Rubia affinis, commonly known as lesser bindweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes many flowering plants known for their medicinal properties. The plant features slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes and produce small, white or pale yellow flowers. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often hairy, with a distinctive aroma when crushed. Rubia affinis is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in woodland edges, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments."
