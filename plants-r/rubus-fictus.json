    "intro": "Rubus fictus, commonly known as the false blackberry, is a species of bramble native to parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its thorny stems and aggregate fruits. The plant produces small, dark red berries that are typically edible but have a tart flavor. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland areas. Due to its resemblance to true blackberries, it is sometimes mistaken for related species in the Rubus genus."
