    "intro": "Rhodiola linearifolia, commonly known as the linear-leaved rhodiola, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia and the Himalayas. It features succulent, linear leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming in the summer months. It is adapted to cold climates and can thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. Rhodiola linearifolia is part of the Crassulaceae family and is often found in alpine meadows and mountainous areas."
