    "intro": "Rubus grypoacanthus, commonly known as the prickly blackberry, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves, typical of many Rubus species. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple or black when mature. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges or disturbed soils. Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is sometimes considered a weed."
