    "intro": "Roemeria tenuifolia, commonly known as narrow-leaved roemeria, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, aromatic leaves. The plant produces small, white or greenish-yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
