    "intro": "Ranunculus acris subvar. glabrescens, commonly known as the slender buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. The plant features upright stems with palmately divided, bright yellow flowers that bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are trifoliate or palmate, with a smooth, glossy surface. The subvariety is distinguished by its reduced pubescence, giving it a more polished appearance compared to other ranunculus species."
