    "intro": "Ribes inerme var. inerme, commonly known as creeping redcurrant, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, arching stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to form dense ground cover. The plant produces small, red, edible berries that are typically harvested in late summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have serrated edges, with a glossy green upper surface. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and wildlife benefits."
