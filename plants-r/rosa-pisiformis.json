    "intro": "Rosa pisiformis, commonly known as the sweet briar rose, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe, North Africa, and western Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems, compound leaves, and clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, red, edible fruits known as hip fruits, which are rich in vitamin C. Rosa pisiformis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and historical use in hedgerows and gardens. It is also notable for its role in the production of rose oil and its association with romantic symbolism."
