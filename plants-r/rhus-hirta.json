    "intro": "Rhus hirta, commonly known as staghorn sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 5 to 11 pairs of serrated leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in upright clusters, followed by red, fuzzy berries that are a common food source for birds. Rhus hirta thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in dry woodlands and open fields. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and ecologically important plant in its native habitats."
