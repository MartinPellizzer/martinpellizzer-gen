    "intro": "Rubus friesiorum f. albiflorus, commonly known as the white-flowered blackberry, is a botanical variant of the blackberry plant native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its pale yellow to white flowers, which contrast with the typical red or pink blooms of other Rubus species. The plant produces small, dark berries that are edible but often less flavorful than those of the common blackberry. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. This form is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique floral display."
