    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus subsp. intervallatus, commonly known as the golden crowfoot, is a member of the Ranunculaceae family. It is characterized by its bright yellow, cup-shaped flowers with 5-10 petal-like sepals. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland edges and stream banks. Its leaves are palmately divided, with lobes that are often notched or toothed. The subspecies intervallatus is distinguished by its shorter, more compact growth habit compared to the typical form of R. auricomus."
