    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus subsp. acidotus, commonly known as the acid-loving buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its bright yellow, cup-shaped flowers and trifoliate leaves. This subspecies thrives in acidic soils and is often found in damp, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its flowers typically bloom in spring, and the plant is known for its ornamental value in gardens. However, it is toxic to both humans and animals due to the presence of protoanemonin."
