It belongs to the Polygonaceae family, which includes other sorrel species, and is characterized by its distinctive leaves with a sour taste due to high oxalic acid content. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its flowers are small and clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Rumex bithynicus is often found in calcareous soils and is considered a characteristic species of certain forest ecosystems."
