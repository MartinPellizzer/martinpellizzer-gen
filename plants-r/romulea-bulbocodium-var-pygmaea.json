    "intro": "Romulea bulbocodium var. pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf romulea, is a small, bulbous perennial plant native to southern Africa. It produces delicate, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. It is often found in rocky or coastal areas, where it adapts well to harsh environmental conditions. Its unique morphology and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and Mediterranean-style landscapes."
