    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 semivicarius, commonly known as the blackberry-loganberry hybrid, is a deciduous shrub belonging to the Rosaceae family. It is a natural hybrid between Rubus ursinus (blackberry) and Rubus loganobaccus (loganberry), resulting in a plant that combines traits from both parents. The plant produces large, dark purple to black berries that are typically larger and sweeter than those of its parent species. It thrives in temperate climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. The foliage is dense, with trifoliate leaves and thorny stems typical of the Rubus genus."
