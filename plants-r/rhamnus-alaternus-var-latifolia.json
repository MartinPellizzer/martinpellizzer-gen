    "intro": "Rhamnus alaternus var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf buckthorn, is a shrub native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, broad oval leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces small, black berries that are typically consumed by birds and other wildlife. It thrives in sunny to partially shaded environments and is often found in dry, rocky soils. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions."
