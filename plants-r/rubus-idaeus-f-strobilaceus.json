    "intro": "Rubus idaeus f. strobilaceus, commonly known as the everbearing raspberry, is a horticultural form of the red raspberry plant. It is characterized by its ability to produce fruit multiple times throughout the growing season, unlike the typical summer-bearing raspberries. The plant is a shrub with thorny stems and compound leaves, typical of the Rubus genus. Its flowers are white and clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by the characteristic red, edible berries. This variety is valued in gardens and commercial cultivation for its extended harvest period and flavorful fruits."
