    "intro": "Rubus poliophyllus, commonly known as the silverleaf blackberry, is a species of brambles native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its distinctive silvery-white undersides on its leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, dark red berries that are typically consumed by birds and other wildlife. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forest margins and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
