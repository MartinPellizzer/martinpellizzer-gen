    "intro": "Rosa spithamea var. solitaria, commonly known as the solitary rose, is a rare and delicate species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its single, fragrant bloom that emerges from a solitary stem, making it a striking ornamental plant. The plant features narrow, finely toothed leaves and produces small, yellowish-green flowers with five petals. It thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
