    "intro": "Ramatuella, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance with pale green or white flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It requires high humidity and indirect light to thrive, making it a challenging species to cultivate. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, Ramatuella is considered a conservation concern."
