    "intro": "Rutaea sericea, commonly known as silverleaf buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems that are covered in a dense layer of silvery-white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are simple, alternate, and have a velvety texture with a pale underside. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by dark blue-black berries that are edible for birds and some mammals. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
