    "intro": "Rhus aglaophylla, commonly known as the broadleaf holly. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Australia, characterized by its alternate, ovate to elliptic leaves that are usually glossy green above and lighter below. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in panicles, followed by bright red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for birds. Rhus aglaophylla is often found in dry sclerophyllous forests and is adapted to poor, well-drained soils. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in coastal and urban environments."
