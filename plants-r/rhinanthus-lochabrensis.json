    "intro": "Rhinanthus lochabrensis, commonly known as the Lochaber sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the Scottish Highlands. It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically thrives in dry, sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late summer to early autumn. It is often found in open habitats such as heaths, moors, and rocky outcrops. Due to its restricted distribution, it is considered a rare and locally endemic species."
