    "intro": "Restio digynus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved restio, is a member of the Restionaceae family, native to southern Africa. It is a perennial herb with slender, grass-like leaves that are typically narrow and pointed. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spike-like clusters, which are often borne on long, slender stems. Restio digynus thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or sandy habitats. Its botanical features make it an important component of fynbos vegetation in its native range."
