    "intro": "Rhus aromatica subsp. flabelliformis, commonly known as the fragrant sumac, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically pinnately divided into 5 to 7 leaflets, giving it a feathery appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in dense, flat-topped clusters, followed by orange-red berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in dry, rocky soils. Its aromatic leaves and showy fruit make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
