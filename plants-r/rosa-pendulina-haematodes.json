    "intro": "Rosa pendulina haematodes, commonly known as the blood-red hanging rose, is a rare and striking species of shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its long, drooping stems and clusters of deep red, velvety flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, elliptical leaves with a slightly hairy surface, and its thorns are slender and not particularly prominent. It thrives in well-drained, alkaline soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
