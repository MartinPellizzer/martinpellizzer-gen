It is native to the wetlands and marshy areas of the Caribbean, particularly in the French West Indies. This plant is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, clustered flowers that bloom in late summer. It plays an important role in its ecosystem by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
