    "intro": "Rytidosperma acerosum, commonly known as the rigid grass, is a perennial grass species native to Australia. It is characterized by its dense, upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a rough, textured surface. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and along coastal areas. Rytidosperma acerosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping due to its hardy nature."
