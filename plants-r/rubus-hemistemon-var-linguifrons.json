    "intro": "Rubus hemistemon var. linguifrons, commonly known as the broadleaf blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to parts of East Asia. It is a shrub characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves that are often broader than those of the typical blackberry species. The flowers are small, white, and clustered in dense inflorescences, while the fruit is a dark purple to black berry. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils. The plant is valued for its edible fruit and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes."
