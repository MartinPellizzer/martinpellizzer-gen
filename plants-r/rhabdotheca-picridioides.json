It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and bract-like leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and produces yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs and have a spiny texture, which helps deter herbivores.
