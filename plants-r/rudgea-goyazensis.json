    "intro": "Rudgea goyazensis, commonly known as the Goyazensis Rudgea, is a striking flowering plant native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to red. The plant typically grows as an upright shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its leaves are palmately lobed, and it produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds. Due to habitat loss, Rudgea goyazensis is considered endangered and is of significant interest for botanical research and conservation efforts."
