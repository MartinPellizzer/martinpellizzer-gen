    "intro": "Rhizophora australis, commonly known as the Australian mangrove, is a species of mangrove tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive prop roots, which help stabilize the tree in tidal and saline environments. The plant thrives in coastal areas, including estuaries and mangrove forests, where it plays a crucial role in shoreline stabilization. Its leaves are typically small,\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), and adapted to reduce water loss in brackish conditions. Rhizophora australis also supports a wide range of marine and terrestrial wildlife, contributing to the biodiversity of its ecosystem."
