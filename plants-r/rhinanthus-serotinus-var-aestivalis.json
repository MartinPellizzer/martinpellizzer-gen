    "intro": "Rhinanthus serotinus var. aestivalis, commonly known as the summer yellow rattle, is a flowering plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, typically from June to August. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and heaths, often found in the UK and parts of Europe. Its ecological importance lies in its role as a nectar source for pollinators like bees and hoverflies."
