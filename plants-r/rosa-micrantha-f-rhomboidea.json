This form exhibits rhomboid (diamond-shaped) leaves, which set it apart from the typical foliage of the species. It is a deciduous shrub native to regions of China, where it thrives in temperate climates. The flowers are usually small and pink, with five petals, and bloom in late spring. Its ornamental value is often appreciated in horticultural settings for its unique foliage and modest floral display."
