    "intro": "Ribes uva-crispa subsp. uva-crispa, commonly known as the European gooseberry, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically grows to a height of 1\u20132 meters, featuring arching branches and alternate, oval-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are initially green and turn yellow or red when ripe. These fruits are encased in a fleshy, persistent calyx, which remains attached even after the berries have matured. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a source of edible berries."
