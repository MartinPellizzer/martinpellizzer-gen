    "intro": "Rhinanthus minor subsp. minor, commonly known as common yellow toadflax, is a flowering plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant typically grows in grasslands, heaths, and woodland edges, thriving in well-drained soils. Its showy, yellow-orange flowers bloom from June to August, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The subspecies minor is characterized by its smaller size and more compact inflorescence compared to other subspecies of Rhinanthus."
