    "intro": "Rubus irrufatus, commonly known as the rough bramble, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is native to the western United States and is characterized by its thorny stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, white to pink flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, aggregate fruits known as berries. Rubus irrufatus is typically found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. Its botanical features make it an important component of local ecosystems and a subject of study in plant ecology."
