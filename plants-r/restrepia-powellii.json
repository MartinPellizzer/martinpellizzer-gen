    "intro": "Restrepia powellii, commonly known as Powell's orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in moist, shaded environments at high elevations. The plant has a pseudobulb structure with fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in its arid habitat. Its flowers are small and clustered, often in shades of white, pink, and purple, and bloom during the cooler months. Restrepia powellii is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
