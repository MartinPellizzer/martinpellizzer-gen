It is characterized by its dark, almost black stems that contrast with its large, palmate leaves. The plant produces distinctive spiny capsules containing toxic seeds, which are used in traditional medicine and as a source of castor oil. It thrives in warm climates and requires well-drained soil. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appearance and historical significance in horticulture."
