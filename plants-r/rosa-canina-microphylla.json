    "intro": "Rosa canina microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved dog rose, is a shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender stems, thorny branches, and small, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces fragrant, pink or white flowers in early summer, which are followed by bright orange-red hips, its fruit. Rosa canina microphylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal medicine. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy addition to gardens and natural habitats."
