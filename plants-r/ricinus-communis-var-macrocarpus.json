    "intro": "Ricinus communis var. macrocarpus, commonly known as the large-seeded castor plant, is a variant of the castor oil plant native to tropical regions. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves and distinctive spiny capsules that contain toxic, oily seeds. The plant is cultivated for its seeds, which are used to produce castor oil, a valuable industrial and medicinal product. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Due to its toxic properties, it is important to handle the plant with care."
