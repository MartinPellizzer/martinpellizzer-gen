It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often on cliffs or slopes. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or black in color, similar to other members of the Rubus genus. Its leaves are compound, with three to five leaflets, and are covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and attractive flowers."
