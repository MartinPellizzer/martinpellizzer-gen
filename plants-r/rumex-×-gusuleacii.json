    "intro": "Rumex \u00d7 gusuleacii, commonly known as the hybrid sorrel, is a naturally occurring hybrid between Rumex acetosa (common sorrel) and Rumex acetobursa (broad-leaved sorrel). It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its distinctive arrow-shaped leaves and red-tinged veins. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in loose spikes, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. Due to its hybrid nature, Rumex \u00d7 gusuleacii exhibits a range of morphological variations depending on its parentage and environmental conditions."
