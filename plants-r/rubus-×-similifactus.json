    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 similifactus, commonly known as the hybrid blackberry raspberry, is a deciduous shrub belonging to the Rosaceae family. It is a natural hybrid between Rubus ursinus (blackberry) and Rubus idaeus (raspberry), resulting in a plant that exhibits traits of both parents. The plant produces aggregate fruits that are typically dark red to black in color, with a tart flavor and a juicy texture. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil. This hybrid is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a fruit-bearing plant in home gardens."
