    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus var. linearilobus, commonly known as the linear-lobed buttercup, is a variant of the auriculate buttercup. It is a herbaceous perennial native to the western United States, particularly California. The plant features bright yellow flowers with five to eight sepals that resemble petals, and its leaves are typically deeply lobed. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. The species is characterized by its slender, linear lobes on the leaves, distinguishing it from other ranunculus varieties."
