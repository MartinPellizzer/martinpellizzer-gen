It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges and related plants. The plant typically grows in marshes, swamps, and other moist environments, often forming dense stands. Its slender, grass-like stems are often found in shallow water or saturated soil. The flowers are small and clustered, with a distinctive three-parted structure that aids in wind pollination."
