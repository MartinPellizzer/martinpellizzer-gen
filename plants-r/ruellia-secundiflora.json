It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 feet, featuring opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of blue to violet tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its flowers are adapted for pollination by bees and other insects, and the plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun. Ruellia secundiflora is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its attractive foliage and showy blooms."
