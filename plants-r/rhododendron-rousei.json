    "intro": "Rhododendron rousei, commonly known as the Chinese rhododendron, is a species native to China, particularly in the provinces of Yunnan and Sichuan. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows in moist, shaded environments at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters. The plant features broad, ovate leaves with a leathery texture and produces clusters of bell-shaped, pink to red flowers in the spring. Rhododendron rousei is part of the Ericaceae family, which includes many evergreen and deciduous shrubs adapted to acidic soils. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for horticultural cultivation in temperate regions."
