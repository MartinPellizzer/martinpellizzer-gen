    "intro": "Rumex obtusifolius, commonly known as broad-leaved dock, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, giving them a rough texture. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish flowers that are surrounded by broad, leaf-like bracts. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in wet meadows. The leaves and stems are sometimes used in traditional herbal remedies due to their astringent properties."
