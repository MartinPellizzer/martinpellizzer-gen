    "intro": "Rhodomyrtus lanata, commonly known as the swamp rose or hairy persimmon, is a deciduous shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive textured appearance. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, hairy berries that turn from green to red as they mature. It thrives in wet, tropical or subtropical climates and is often found in swampy or moist forest areas. Rhodomyrtus lanata is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
