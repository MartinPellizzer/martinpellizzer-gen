It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically trifoliate or pinnate, with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits known as drupes, which are usually red or black when mature. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The subspecies is distinguished by its leaf morphology and habitat preferences compared to other Rubus species."
