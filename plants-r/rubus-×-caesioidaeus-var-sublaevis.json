    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 caesioidaeus var. sublaevis, commonly known as the pink flowering raspberry, is a hybrid species within the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces edible, red berries that are similar in appearance to raspberries but have a distinct, slightly tart flavor. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental and edible gardens. Due to its hybrid nature, it is often found in cultivation rather than in the wild."
