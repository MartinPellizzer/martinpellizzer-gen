    "intro": "Ranunculus rigidifolius, commonly known as the rigid-leaved buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a short, stout rhizome and produces erect, branching stems covered in soft, hairy tissue. The plant's leaves are deeply divided into narrow, rigid segments, giving it its common name. Its flowers are typically yellow with five petal-like sepals and are borne in clusters at the top of the stems. Ranunculus rigidifolius prefers well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats."
