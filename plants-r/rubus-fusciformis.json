    "intro": "Rubus fusciformis, commonly known as the blackberry cane or bramble, is a shrub native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that develop into aggregate fruits, which are typically dark purple to black when mature. Rubus fusciformis is often found in woodland edges, thickets, and disturbed soils, thriving in partial shade to full sun. Its berries are edible but can be quite tart, and the plant is known for its vigorous growth and ability to spread through rhizomes."
