It belongs to the Convolvulaceae family and is characterized by its trumpet-shaped, showy flowers that range in color from purple to blue. The plant is an annual herb that grows up to 2 meters tall, with hairy stems and alternate leaves. Its flowers open in the morning and close by midday, hence its common name. The seeds are enclosed in a fibrous, hairy capsule that splits open when mature to release the seeds."
