    "intro": "Rubus arduennensis microgene vicarius, commonly known as the Arduennian raspberry, is a rare shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and small, red-orange fruits. The plant produces trifoliate leaves with serrated margins and has a woody stem covered in fine, glandular hairs. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in shaded, moist environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
