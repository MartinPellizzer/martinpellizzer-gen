    "intro": "Ranunculus isthmicus subsp. isthmicus, commonly known as the Isthmian buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the Andes Mountains. It features showy, yellow flowers with five to eight sepals that resemble petals, and it typically grows in moist, rocky habitats. The plant has a short, fibrous root system and hairy stems that bear alternate, trifoliate leaves. It blooms from late winter to early spring, producing numerous small, yellow flowers that attract pollinators. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and ecological adaptation to high-altitude environments."
