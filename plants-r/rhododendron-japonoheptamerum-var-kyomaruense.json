    "intro": "Rhododendron japonoheptamerum var. kyomaruense, commonly known as the Kyomaru rhododendron, is a rare and distinctive plant native to Japan. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically blooms in early spring, producing clusters of pink to reddish-purple blooms that attract pollinators. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and requires partial to full shade, making it suitable for shaded garden environments. Due to its limited distribution and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and specialized collections."
