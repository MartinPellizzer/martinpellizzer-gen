    "intro": "Rubus cubitans, commonly known as the climbing blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its trailing or climbing growth habit, with thorny stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically edible, though they may be tart or bitter. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the flowers are white with five petals. Rubus cubitans thrives in moist, sunny environments and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils."
