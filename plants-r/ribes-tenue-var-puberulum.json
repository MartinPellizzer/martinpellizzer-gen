    "intro": "Ribes tenue var. puberulum, commonly known as the smooth currant, is a deciduous shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its slender, arching stems and small, elliptical leaves that are typically hairy on the underside. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by small, edible berries that ripen to a dark red or black color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in culinary and medicinal applications."
