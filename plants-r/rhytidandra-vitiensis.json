It belongs to the family Meliaceae, which includes mahogany and related trees. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and distinctive, palmate leaves. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments within tropical rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
