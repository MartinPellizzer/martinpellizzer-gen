    "intro": "Rodriguezia cuentillensis, commonly known as the Cuenca Rodriguezia, is a striking tropical plant native to the humid forests of Central America. It is a member of the Malvaceae family, characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from red to orange. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its leaves are large, heart-shaped, and often have a velvety texture, while its roots form a dense network that helps stabilize the surrounding ecosystem. Rodriguezia cuentillensis is valued not only for its ornamental appeal but also for its role in supporting local biodiversity."
