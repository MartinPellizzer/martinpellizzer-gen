    "intro": "Rosa pouzinii var. almeriensis, commonly known as the Almer\u00eda rose, is a rare and ornamental shrub native to southern Spain. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has small, elliptical leaves with serrated edges, typical of many rose species. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a container plant. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
