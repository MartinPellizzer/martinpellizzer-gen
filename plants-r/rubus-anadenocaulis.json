    "intro": "Rubus anadenocaulis, commonly known as the alpine raspberry, is a species of bramble native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its hairy, woody stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or yellow in color. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
