    "intro": "Rosa alpina var. rotundifolia, commonly known as the Alpine rose or round-leafed rose, is a perennial shrub native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dark green, oval-shaped leaves that are slightly hairy. The plant produces fragrant, pink to white flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often cultivated in gardens and used in floral arrangements."
