It is a perennial herb characterized by its basal leaves with deeply lobed margins and bright yellow flowers with five to eight petals. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks. It has a fibrous root system and produces achenes with pappus for wind dispersal. The subspecies is distinguished by its smaller, more compact flowers compared to the typical form of R. auricomus."
