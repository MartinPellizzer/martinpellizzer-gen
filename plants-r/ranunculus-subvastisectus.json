    "intro": "Ranunculus subvastisectus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features delicate, nodding flowers with five petals that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and stream banks. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
