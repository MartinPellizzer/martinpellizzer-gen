    "intro": "Rhus oreophila, commonly known as the mountain sumac, is a shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Anacardiaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like poison ivy and mango. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often arranged in pairs along the stems. Its small, yellowish-green flowers are clustered in catkins, and it produces red, berry-like fruits that are an important food source for wildlife. Rhus oreophila is typically found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to woodland and mountainous environments."
