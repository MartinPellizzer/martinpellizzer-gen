It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black when mature. It thrives in moist, wooded areas and is often found in the understory of deciduous forests. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in certain regions."
