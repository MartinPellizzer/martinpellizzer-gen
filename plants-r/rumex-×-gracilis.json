It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are typically borne on branched inflorescences. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in woodland edges. Due to its hybrid origin, Rumex \u00d7 gracilis exhibits a range of morphological variations."
