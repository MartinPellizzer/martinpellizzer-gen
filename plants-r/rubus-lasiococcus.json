    "intro": "Rubus lasiococcus, commonly known as the woolly blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its dense, woolly pubescence covering the stems and leaves, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically edible, though they may be somewhat tart. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and natural habitats."
