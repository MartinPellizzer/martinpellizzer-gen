It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and streams. The plant has slender, branching stems that are often submerged or floating, with small, lance-shaped leaves that are usually alternate. Its flowers are white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters, and are pollinated by insects. The species is noted for its ability to thrive in nutrient-rich, disturbed waters, making it an indicator of eutrophic conditions."
