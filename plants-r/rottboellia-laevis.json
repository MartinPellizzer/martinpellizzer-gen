    "intro": "Rottboellia laevis, commonly known as the silky grass or silky flat sedge, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, leafy stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded areas, such as marshes and along riverbanks. Its leaves are usually smooth and hairless, with a grass-like texture, and it produces small, three-angled fruits. Rottboellia laevis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and tolerate waterlogged conditions."
