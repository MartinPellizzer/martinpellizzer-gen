The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow, often arranged in a spiral pattern. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Renanthera arachnites is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts."
