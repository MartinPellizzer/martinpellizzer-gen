    "intro": "Ranunculus eriophyllus, commonly known as the woolly buttercup, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and bright yellow flowers with numerous petals. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils. Its flowers bloom in the spring and are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
