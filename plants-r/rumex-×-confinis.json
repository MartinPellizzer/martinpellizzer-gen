The plant typically has heart-shaped, reddish-veined leaves that are edible but contain oxalic acid. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along streambanks. Its flowers are small and greenish, appearing in clusters, and it is known for its ability to spread through rhizomes."
