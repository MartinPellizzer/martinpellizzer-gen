    "intro": "Roupala panamensis, commonly known as the Panamanian roupala, is a small evergreen tree native to Central America. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by distinctive, three-lobed capsules as its fruit. It thrives in humid, tropical environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
