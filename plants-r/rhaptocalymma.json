    "intro": "Rhaptocalymma, commonly known as the coastal rock heath, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Australia. It belongs to the family Epacridaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, often in areas exposed to salt spray. Rhaptocalymma species are shrubs with narrow, leathery leaves that help them withstand harsh coastal conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant."
