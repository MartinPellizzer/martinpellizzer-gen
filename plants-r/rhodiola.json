    "intro": "Rhodiola, commonly known as the \"golden root,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Crassulaceae. It is native to cold, mountainous regions of the Arctic, Alaska, and Siberia, where it thrives in harsh environments. The plant is characterized by its fleshy, succulent leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer. Rhodiola species are often used in traditional medicine for their adaptogenic properties, which help the body resist stress. Botanically, they are distinguished by their rosette-like growth habit and ability to store water in their thick stems and leaves."
