    "intro": "Ricinocarpus glabratus var. latifolius, commonly known as the broad-leafed mangrove, is a variant of the mangrove species native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad,\u9769\u8d28 (leathery) leaves that are typically 10\u201320 cm in length. The plant thrives in saline and brackish water environments, often forming dense thickets in tidal zones. Its bark is rough and dark, while its roots develop into pneumatophores to facilitate oxygen absorption in waterlogged soils. This variant plays a crucial role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species."
