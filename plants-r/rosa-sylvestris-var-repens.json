    "intro": "Rosa sylvestris var. repens, commonly known as the creeping wild rose, is a low-growing shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, trailing stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink to red, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with serrated leaflets that are covered in fine hairs. This variety is often found in woodland edges, hedgerows, and disturbed soils, where it thrives in partial shade to full sun."
