It is characterized by its dense, thorny bushes and compound leaves with serrated edges. The flowers are typically white or pale pink, and the fruit is a dark purple to black berry. This variety is notable for its smooth, less hairy fruit surface compared to other Rubus species. It is often cultivated for its edible fruits, which have a sweet and tart flavor."
