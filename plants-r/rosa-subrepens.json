    "intro": "Rosa subrepens, commonly known as the creeping rose, is a low-growing shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, trailing stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink or white, typically blooming in early summer. Its leaves are compound, consisting of five to seven oval-shaped leaflets with a serrated edge. Rosa subrepens is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to cover ground effectively."
