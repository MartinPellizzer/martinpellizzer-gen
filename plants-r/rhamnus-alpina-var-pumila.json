    "intro": "Rhamnus alpina var. pumila, commonly known as the alpine buckthorn, is a shrub native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in rocky, alpine environments and is adapted to cold, harsh climates. The plant has small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are small and greenish-yellow, appearing in clusters, and it produces small, dark berries that are edible for some bird species. The plant is valued for its hardiness and is often used in ecological restoration projects in high-altitude areas."
