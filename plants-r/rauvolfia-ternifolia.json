    "intro": "Rauvolfia ternifolia, commonly known as Indian snakeroot, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Pacific Islands. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its climbing habit, with opposite, ovate leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in cymes, followed by elliptical, winged fruits. Its roots are rich in alkaloids, particularly reserpine, which has been historically used in traditional medicine for its hypotensive properties."
