    "intro": "Rhipsalis cereiformis, commonly known as the white mist cactus, is a unique epiphytic cactus native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its long, slender, pale green stems that often appear almost like tendrils or threads. The plant produces small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom during the summer months. Its leaves are reduced to small, rounded structures, and it lacks the typical spines found in many cacti. Rhipsalis cereiformis thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
