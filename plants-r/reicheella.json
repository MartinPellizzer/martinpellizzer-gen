These plants are characterized by their small, delicate flowers and are native to various regions in South America. Reicheella species typically grow in humid, shaded environments, often in forest understories. They have rhizomatous growth habits and produce showy, often fragrant blooms. Due to their specific ecological requirements, many species are threatened by habitat loss and are of interest in conservation efforts."
