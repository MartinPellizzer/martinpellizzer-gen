It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its vibrant, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from red to orange. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Reigera thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for both gardens and indoor cultivation."
