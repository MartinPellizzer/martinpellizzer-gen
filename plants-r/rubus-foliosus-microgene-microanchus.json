    "intro": "Rubus foliosus microgene microanchus, commonly known as the microanchus raspberry, is a rare and diminutive shrub belonging to the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its small, clustered growth habit and trifoliate leaves that are typically covered in fine, silvery hairs. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible but often overlooked due to its modest size. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky or forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
