    "intro": "Romulea bulbocodioides var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf romulea, is a member of the Iridaceae family and is native to southern Africa. It is a small, herbaceous perennial that produces delicate, grass-like leaves and striking, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange. The plant forms a corm-like bulb, which serves as its primary storage organ and allows it to survive dry periods. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and unique appearance, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and as a cut flower."
