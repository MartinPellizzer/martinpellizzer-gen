It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in summer, often in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is typically found in coastal areas and on rocky outcrops. This variety is distinguished by its softer, more hairy foliage compared to other varieties of Raoulia."
