    "intro": "Rodriguezia lindmanii, commonly known as the Lindman's rodriguezia, is a tropical flowering plant native to the rainforests of South America. It belongs to the family Anacardiaceae, which includes plants like the cashew and poison ivy. The plant is characterized by its large, palmate leaves and showy, clustered inflorescences that produce small, yellowish flowers. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
