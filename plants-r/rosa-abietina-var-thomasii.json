    "intro": "Rosa abietina var. thomasii, commonly known as the Thomas's mountain rose, is a perennial shrub native to the high altitudes of the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Its leaves are dark green, leathery, and covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in mountain ecosystems."
