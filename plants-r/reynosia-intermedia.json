It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 4 to 8 inches long and have a smooth, glossy surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by dark purple berries in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal scrub and chaparral habitats. Reynosia intermedia is valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to provide habitat for local wildlife."
