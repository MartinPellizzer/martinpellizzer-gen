    "intro": "Rhamnus punctata var. punctata, commonly known as the spotted buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to parts of eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of 2 to 6 feet and features small, oval-shaped leaves with a distinctive yellow or greenish-white spot near the base. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by dark blue berries that are an important food source for birds. Its bark is smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age, and it is often found in moist woodlands or along streambanks. The species is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological benefits in native habitats."
