    "intro": "Rubus fruticosus var. ulmifolius, commonly known as brambles or blackberries, is a thorny shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically three to five lobed and resemble those of the elm tree, hence its specific epithet *ulmifolius*. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, followed by edible berries that ripen in summer. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in hedgerows, woodland edges, and disturbed areas. Due to its hardy nature and adaptability, it is a common weed in many regions."
