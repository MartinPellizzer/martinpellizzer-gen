    "intro": "Rhodospatha melinonii, commonly known as the Melinon's orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America, where it thrives in cool, humid environments. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white, which bloom during the cooler months. Its leaves are broad and leathery, adapted to conserve moisture in its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
