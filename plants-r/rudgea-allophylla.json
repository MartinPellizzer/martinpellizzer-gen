    "intro": "Rudgea allophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rudgea, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit. The plant features small, opposite leaves that are typically narrow and leathery, adapted to the high-altitude environments where it grows. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, clustered in small umbels, and are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Rudgea allophylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
