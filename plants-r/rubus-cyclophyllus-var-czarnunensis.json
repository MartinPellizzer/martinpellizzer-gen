    "intro": "Rubus cyclophyllus var. czarnunensis, commonly known as the Czarnun's blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to specific regions of Eastern Europe. It is characterized by its dark, almost black berries that are typically larger than those of the standard Rubus cyclophyllus. The plant produces compound leaves with serrated edges and has a thorny stem structure typical of many Rubus species. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forested areas with well-drained soil. The fruit is valued for its flavor and is sometimes used in local culinary traditions."
