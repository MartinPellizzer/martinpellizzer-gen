    "intro": "Rhus toxicodendron f. radicans, commonly known as poison ivy, is a deciduous shrub belonging to the Anacardiaceae family. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged opposite each other on the stem. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are followed by red, fuzzy fruits containing three seeds. Poison ivy is known for its potent allergenic oil, urushiol, which can cause severe skin irritation in sensitive individuals. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including woodlands, fields, and along roadsides, and is commonly found across the eastern and central United States."
