    "intro": "Ranunculus colonorum, commonly known as the alpine buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in rocky or meadow habitats at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant features a short, stout stem with palmately divided, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. Its leaves are deeply lobed and often have a hairy texture, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. Ranunculus colonorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in supporting local pollinators in its native ecosystems."
