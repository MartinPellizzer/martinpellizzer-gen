It features fleshy, cylindrical stems and produces striking, heart-shaped flowers in shades of red, pink, and white. The plant's leaves are typically blue-green with a powdery coating, and it thrives in well-drained soil and full sun. It is drought-tolerant and often used in rock gardens or as a container plant. The species name \"vulnerans\" refers to its ability to bleed or exude a sap-like substance when damaged."
