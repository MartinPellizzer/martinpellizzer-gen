    "intro": "Rhexia glandulosa, commonly known as the stickyleaf sorrel, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its small, yellowish-orange flowers and hairy, glandular leaves that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, wooded areas and is often found in swampy or wetland habitats. Its leaves are covered in tiny, sticky glands that secrete a viscous substance, which can trap insects. Rhexia glandulosa is a member of the Geraniaceae family and is known for its unique botanical features and ecological role in its native environment."
