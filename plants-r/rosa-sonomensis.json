    "intro": "Rosa sonomensis, commonly known as the Sonoma rose, is a species native to California, particularly in the Sonoma County region. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring woody stems and dense foliage. The plant produces fragrant, pink to white flowers in late spring to early summer, which are borne on long pedicels. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with five to seven oval leaflets, and it has a deep root system that helps it survive in dry conditions. Rosa sonomensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its beauty and fragrance."
