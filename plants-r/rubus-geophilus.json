    "intro": "Rubus geophilus, commonly known as the creeping raspberry, is a species of bramble native to North America. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces edible red berries in the summer, which are similar in taste to other raspberries but often more delicate. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the plant has a woody stem covered in stiff, thorny hairs. Rubus geophilus thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
