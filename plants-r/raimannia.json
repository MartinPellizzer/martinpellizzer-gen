    "intro": "Raimannia, commonly known as the goldenweed, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Asteraceae. These plants are characterized by their showy, yellow or orange composite flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Raimannia species are typically found in arid and semi-arid regions, thriving in well-drained soils. They have a rosette growth habit with narrow, linear leaves that help reduce water loss. The genus includes several species, some of which are used in traditional medicine or as ornamental plants."
