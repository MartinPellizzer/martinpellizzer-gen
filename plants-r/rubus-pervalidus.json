    "intro": "Rubus pervalidus, commonly known as the alpine raspberry, is a species of bramble native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, aggregate fruits that ripen to a deep red color. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are palmately compound, with serrated edges and a dense covering of fine hairs. Rubus pervalidus plays a role in supporting local wildlife, particularly insects and birds, due to its nectar-rich flowers and edible fruits."
