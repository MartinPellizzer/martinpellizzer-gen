    "intro": "Rubus foliosus microgene longithyrsiger, commonly known as the slenderleaf blackberry, is a shrub belonging to the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its small, trifoliate leaves and thorny stems, typical of many Rubus species. The plant produces aggregate fruits composed of tiny drupes, which are usually dark purple to black in color. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils. Due to its genetic variability, it exhibits a range of morphological traits across different populations."
