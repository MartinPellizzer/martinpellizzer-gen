    "intro": "Rudgea sororia, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its woody stems and small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in tropical rainforests and has compound leaves with opposite arrangement. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink and attract various pollinators. Due to its dense, dark wood, it has been historically valued for musical instrument making, though its conservation status is now of concern."
