    "intro": "Ranunculus ophioglossifolius var. terrestris, commonly known as the creeping buttercup, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a sprawling, rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread across the ground, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in early spring. Its leaves are trifoliate, with deeply lobed divisions, and the entire plant is often found in moist, shaded environments. It is considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its aggressive growth habit."
