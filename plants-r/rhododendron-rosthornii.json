    "intro": "Rhododendron rosthornii, commonly known as the St. Helena rhododendron, is a rare and endemic species native to the island of St. Helena in the South Atlantic Ocean. It is a shrub characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and showy, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant thrives in the humid, subtropical climate of its native habitat, often growing in rocky or coastal areas. Its botanical significance lies in its unique adaptations to the isolated environment of St. Helena. Due to habitat loss and limited genetic diversity, it is considered vulnerable and is the subject of conservation efforts."
