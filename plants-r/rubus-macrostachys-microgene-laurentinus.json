    "intro": "Rubus macrostachys microgene laurentinus, commonly known as the laurentinus raspberry, is a species of brambles native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and thorny stems, which help in its identification. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red when ripe, containing multiple tiny drupelets. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three leaflets that are serrated along the edges. This species is often found in wetlands and along stream banks, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils."
