    "intro": "Rosa canina var. ascita, commonly known as the Turkish rose or the wild dog rose, is a variant of the dog rose. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as hillsides and grasslands. The plant produces pink to red flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by orange-red hips that are rich in vitamin C. Its leaves are compound, with five to seven oval-shaped leaflets, and the stems are armed with stiff, straight prickles. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
