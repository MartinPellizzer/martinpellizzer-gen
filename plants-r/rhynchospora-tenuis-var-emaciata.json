    "intro": "Rhynchospora tenuis var. emaciata, commonly known as the slender spike-rush, is a grass-like plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in late summer. The plant is native to wetland habitats and thrives in moist, acidic soils. Its slender stem and reduced leaf structure are adaptations to its aquatic or semi-aquatic environment. This variety is often found in marshes, bogs, and along the edges of ponds."
