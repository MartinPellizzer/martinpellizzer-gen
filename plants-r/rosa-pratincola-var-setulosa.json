    "intro": "Rosa pratincola var. setulosa, commonly known as the woolly meadow rose, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive, soft appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant pink or white flowers in early summer. It prefers well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
