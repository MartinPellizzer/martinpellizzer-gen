    "intro": "Rosa canina f. inurbana, commonly known as the urban rose, is a botanical variant of the dog rose. It is characterized by its smaller, more compact growth habit, making it well-suited for urban environments. The plant produces pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by red, hairy fruits known as hips. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal maintenance, which contributes to its popularity in city landscapes. This form is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and adaptability to polluted conditions."
