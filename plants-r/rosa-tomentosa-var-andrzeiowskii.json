It is characterized by its dense, silvery-white pubescence covering the stems and leaves, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces fragrant, pink to reddish flowers in late spring to early summer. It is often found in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
