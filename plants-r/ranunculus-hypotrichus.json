It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family, characterized by its showy, often brightly colored flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are palmately divided, and the flowers consist of numerous petal-like sepals rather than true petals. It is known for its early spring blooming habit and is sometimes considered invasive in certain regions."
