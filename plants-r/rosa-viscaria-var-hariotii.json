    "intro": "Rosa viscaria var. hariotii, commonly known as the Hariot's rose, is a variant of the sticky rose species native to China. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and small, fragrant pink flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has hairy foliage and produces red-orange hips that persist into winter. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and long blooming period."
