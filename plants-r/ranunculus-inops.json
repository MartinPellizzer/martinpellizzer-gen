    "intro": "Ranunculus inops, commonly known as the barren buttercup, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and a single, showy yellow flower with five petals. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soil and full sun. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and it is often found in high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Ranunculus inops is considered a rare and endangered species."
