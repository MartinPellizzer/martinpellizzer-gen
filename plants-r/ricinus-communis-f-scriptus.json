    "intro": "Ricinus communis f. scriptus, commonly known as the variegated castor bean, is a striking ornamental plant characterized by its unique foliage. Its leaves are typically broad, palmately lobed, and display a combination of green, white, and sometimes yellow variegation. The plant is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Africa. It produces distinctive spiny capsules containing toxic seeds, which are used in traditional medicine and industry. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens, though care must be taken due to its poisonous properties."
