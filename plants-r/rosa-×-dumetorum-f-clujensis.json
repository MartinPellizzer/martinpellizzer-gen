    "intro": "Rosa \u00d7 dumetorum f. clujensis, commonly known as the Clujensis rose, is a compact, shrub-like plant native to the Carpathian region. It is characterized by its dark green, slightly hairy leaves and fragrant, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and has a spreading habit, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in temperate climates."
