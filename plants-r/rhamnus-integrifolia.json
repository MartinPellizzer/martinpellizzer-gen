    "intro": "Rhamnus integrifolia, commonly known as the smoothleaf buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its smooth, dark green leaves that are entire, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by dark blue berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, and it has a tendency to form dense thickets in its native habitat. Rhamnus integrifolia is often found in moist, shady areas such as forest understories and along streambanks."
