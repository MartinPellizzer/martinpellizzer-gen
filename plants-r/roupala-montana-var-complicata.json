    "intro": "Roupala montana var. complicata, commonly known as the mountain roupala, is a shrub native to the temperate regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and distinctive, compound leaves that are often deeply lobed. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are followed by spherical, woody fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in forested or mountainous areas. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely known outside its native range."
