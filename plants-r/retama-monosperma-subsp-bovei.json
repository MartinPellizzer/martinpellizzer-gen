It is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and prickly, branched stems. The plant produces small, woody pods that contain a single seed, a feature that distinguishes it from other members of the Retama genus. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. The leaves are typically small and leathery, providing some drought resistance."
