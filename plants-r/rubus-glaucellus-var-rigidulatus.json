    "intro": "Rubus glaucellus var. rigidulatus, commonly known as the rigid-leaf blackberry, is a shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and thorny stems, which are typical of many Rubus species. The leaves are elliptical, with a waxy, bluish-green upper surface and a pale underside, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Its flowers are small, white, and clustered in dense inflorescences, while the fruit is a dark purple to black berry that ripens in late summer. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often found in moist, shaded woodlands."
