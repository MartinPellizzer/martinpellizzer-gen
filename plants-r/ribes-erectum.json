    "intro": "Ribes erectum, commonly known as the upright gooseberry, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring upright, branching stems covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by edible, yellow berries that ripen in late summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have serrated edges, often turning red in the fall. Ribes erectum is adapted to a variety of soil types and thrives in full sun to partial shade."
