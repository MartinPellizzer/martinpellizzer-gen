    "intro": "Rhodocactus saipinensis, commonly known as the Saipan rhodocactus, is a rare cactus species native to the island of Saipan in the Northern Mariana Islands. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in dense, white spines, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its otherwise desolate appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to coastal and rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a vulnerable species."
