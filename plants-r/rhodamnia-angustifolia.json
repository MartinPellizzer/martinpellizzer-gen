It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and produces small, pale yellow flowers in late winter to early spring. The plant has a woody structure with persistent leaves that remain throughout the year. It is often found in sandy or rocky soils in coastal and inland regions. Rhodamnia angustifolia is adapted to dry conditions and is drought-tolerant once established."
