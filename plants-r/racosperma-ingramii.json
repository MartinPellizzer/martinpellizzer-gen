It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often bipinnate, and its small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces pods that contain several seeds, and it is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Racosperma ingramii plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native wildlife in its native range."
