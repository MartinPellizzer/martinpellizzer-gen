    "intro": "Rubus fasciculatiformis, commonly known as the clustered bramble. This plant is a species of shrub belonging to the Rosaceae family, characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves. It produces small, aggregate fruits known as drupes, which are typically red or black in color. The plant is native to certain regions of Asia and is often found in moist, wooded areas. Due to its rugged appearance and potential for invasive growth, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
