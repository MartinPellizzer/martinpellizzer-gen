    "intro": "Rhododendron scabrifolium var. pauciflorum, commonly known as the rough-leaved rhododendron, is a compact evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of China. It features dark green, leathery leaves that are rough to the touch, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to red, typically blooming in late spring. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is a popular choice for gardeners in temperate climates."
