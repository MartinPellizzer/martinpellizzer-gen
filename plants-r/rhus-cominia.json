    "intro": "Rhus cominia, commonly known as the Chinese sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to East Asia. It belongs to the Anacardiaceae family, which includes other plants like poison ivy and cashews. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves, which are usually opposite and have serrated edges. Its small, yellowish-green flowers appear in clusters and are followed by red, fuzzy fruits that mature in the fall. Rhus cominia is often used in traditional medicine and ornamental gardening due to its attractive foliage and autumn color."
