    "intro": "Rubus aemulans, commonly known as the mimic raspberry, is a species of bramble native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It belongs to the Rubus genus, which includes many species of shrubs commonly referred to as blackberries, raspberries, and dewberries. The plant is characterized by its thorny stems, trifoliate leaves, and aggregate fruits that resemble those of other Rubus species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its similarity to other raspberries, it can be challenging to distinguish without close examination."
