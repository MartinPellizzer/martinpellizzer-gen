    "intro": "Rhamnus oleoides subsp. tauricula, commonly known as the Tauric buckthorn, is a shrub native to the southern regions of the Caucasus and parts of Turkey. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. The plant features small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Its flowers are greenish-yellow and appear in clusters, followed by small, fleshy berries that are a food source for various birds and mammals. The subspecies is noted for its resilience and is often used in ecological restoration projects in its native range."
