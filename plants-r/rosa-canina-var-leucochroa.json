    "intro": "Rosa canina var. leucochroa, commonly known as the white-chested dog rose, is a botanical variant of the common dog rose. It is characterized by its pale pink to white flowers, which are typically smaller than those of the typical Rosa canina. The plant produces hips, which are the fruit, and these are often used in traditional herbal medicine. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in hedgerows and woodland edges. Its foliage is dark green and its thorns are relatively short and curved."
