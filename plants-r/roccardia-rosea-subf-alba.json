It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in umbels. The plant has finely divided, feathery leaves that give it a soft, ethereal appearance. It is native to specific regions in southern Europe and is often found in moist, calcareous soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
