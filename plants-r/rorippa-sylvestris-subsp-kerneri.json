    "intro": "Rorippa sylvestris subsp. kerneri, commonly known as the Kern's watercress, is a herbaceous plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, serrated leaves that are typically submerged or floating in shallow water. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which are pollinated by insects. It thrives in moist or aquatic environments, such as ponds, ditches, and stream margins. Its leaves are edible and have a peppery flavor, similar to other watercress species."
