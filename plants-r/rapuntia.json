    "intro": "Rapuntia, commonly known as Chinese artichoke, is a perennial plant native to East Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its edible, tuberous roots that resemble small artichokes. The plant produces yellow flowers in the summer, which are followed by fluffy, seed-filled heads. Its leaves are broad and lobed, often with a slightly hairy texture. Rapuntia thrives in temperate climates and is cultivated for both its nutritional value and ornamental appeal."
