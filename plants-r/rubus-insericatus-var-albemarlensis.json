    "intro": "Rubus insericatus var. albemarlensis, commonly known as the white-fruited blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to parts of North America. It is characterized by its finely hairy stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow fruits that are typically less showy than other blackberry varieties. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
