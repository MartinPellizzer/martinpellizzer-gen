It is characterized by its small, elliptic leaves that are typically less than 2 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, black berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in chaparral and woodland habitats. Its botanical features make it well-adapted to the arid and semi-arid environments of its native range."
