    "intro": "Roldana platanifolia, commonly known as the plane-tree roldana, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, temperate environments and prefers well-drained soil. Its leaves are broad and palmately lobed, resembling those of the plane tree, hence its common name. Roldana platanifolia is often found in open woodlands and along riverbanks, where it contributes to local biodiversity."
