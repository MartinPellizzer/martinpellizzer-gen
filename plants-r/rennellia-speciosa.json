    "intro": "Rennellia speciosa, commonly known as the Rennell beauty, is a rare flowering plant native to the island of Rennell in the Solomon Islands. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that are typically yellow or orange with intricate patterns. The plant grows as an erect shrub with hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers bloom in clusters and are pollinated primarily by birds, particularly honeyeaters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Rennellia speciosa is considered a conservation concern."
