    "intro": "Rhynchoglossum spumosum, commonly known as the foamy rhynchoglossum, is a species of flowering plant in the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, foamy appearance due to the presence of hollow, inflated stems. The plant typically grows in moist, temperate environments and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Its flowers are small and clustered, with white to pale yellow petals. Rhynchoglossum spumosum is notable for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and contributing to the biodiversity of its native habitats."
