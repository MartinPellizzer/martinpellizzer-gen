It is characterized by its thorny stems, compound leaves, and aggregate fruits that develop from multiple flowers. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by the familiar red or black berries in the summer. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, loamy soils. This plant is often found in woodland edges, fields, and along roadsides, where it plays a role in supporting local wildlife."
