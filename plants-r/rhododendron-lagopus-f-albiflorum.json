    "intro": "Rhododendron lagopus f. albiflorum, commonly known as the white-flowered snowbell rhododendron, is a rare and ornamental plant native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that bloom in early spring, contrasting beautifully with its dark green, leathery leaves. The plant typically grows as an evergreen shrub, reaching heights of up to 2 meters, and prefers well-drained, acidic soils in shaded to semi-shaded environments. Its floral display is particularly notable for its elegance and fragrance, making it a sought-after species in botanical gardens. Due to its limited natural range and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a delicate and conservation-sensitive plant."
