It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically pinnate with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in panicles, followed by woody, spiny pods that contain seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. Rhus brenanii is adapted to dry conditions and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
