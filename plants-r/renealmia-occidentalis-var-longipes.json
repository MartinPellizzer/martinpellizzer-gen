    "intro": "Renealmia occidentalis var. longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed renealmia, is a herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of southern Florida and parts of the Caribbean. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters, often forming dense clumps. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom in the late spring to early summer. Its leaves are elongated, narrow, and often have a waxy coating, adapting to the humid and waterlogged environments it inhabits. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
