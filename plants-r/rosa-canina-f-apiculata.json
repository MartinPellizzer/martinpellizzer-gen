    "intro": "Rosa canina f. apiculata, commonly known as the prickly rose or dog rose, is a subspecies of the dog rose native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of pink to red flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces bright orange-red hips, which are the fruit and are often used in herbal remedies. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with serrated edges, and it thrives in well-drained soils. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
