    "intro": "Rigiopappus, commonly known as the silverleaf tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family (Asteraceae). It is native to Africa and is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. Rigiopappus species are often found in arid or semi-arid regions, adapting to harsh environmental conditions. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and have been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
