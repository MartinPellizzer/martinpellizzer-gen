    "intro": "Ruprechtia fusca, commonly known as the red-tipped plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and thrives in rich, well-drained soils. The plant features basal rosettes of lance-shaped leaves with a distinctive reddish-purple hue at the tips. Its small, white flowers appear in clusters during the spring and are followed by three-lobed seed capsules. Ruprechtia fusca is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in woodland habitats."
