    "intro": "Rosa hispanica var. nevadensis, commonly known as the Nevada Spanish rose, is a shrub-like perennial native to the mountainous regions of Spain and parts of southern France. It features upright stems with thorny growth, and its leaves are compound, consisting of five to seven oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces fragrant, semi-double flowers in shades of pink to red, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens or alpine settings. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
