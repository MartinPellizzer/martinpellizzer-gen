It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring multiple stems with thorny branches. The plant produces fragrant, pink to white flowers in late spring to early summer, which are followed by red, hairy fruits known as hip fruits. Its leaves are compound, consisting of 5 to 7 elliptical leaflets, and the plant is known for its adaptability to various soil types. Rosa polymorpha is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in horticultural research due to its genetic diversity."
