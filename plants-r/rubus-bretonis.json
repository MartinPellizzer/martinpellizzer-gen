    "intro": "Rubus bretonis, commonly known as the Brittany raspberry, is a species of bramble native to western Europe. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and produces small, red, edible berries. The plant has pinnate leaves with serrated edges and produces white to pale pink flowers in the spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along streambanks. Due to its limited range, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
