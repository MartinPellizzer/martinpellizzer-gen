    "intro": "Rhododendron proliferum, commonly known as the evergreen rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 10 meters. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, providing a striking contrast to the vibrant floral displays. Rhododendron proliferum thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in humid, shaded forest environments."
