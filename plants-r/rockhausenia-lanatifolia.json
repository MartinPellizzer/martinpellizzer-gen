    "intro": "Rockhausenia lanatifolia, commonly known as the woolly leaf rockhausenia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance, with leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand periods of drought. Rockhausenia lanatifolia is often found in rocky or sandy habitats, making it a resilient species in harsh environments."
