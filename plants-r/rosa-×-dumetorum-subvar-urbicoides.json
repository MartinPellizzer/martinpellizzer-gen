    "intro": "Rosa \u00d7 dumetorum subvar. urbicoides, commonly known as the urban rose, is a compact, shrub-like plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and small, dark green leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery down. The flowers are usually pink to red, with five petals, and bloom in late spring to early summer. This variety is well adapted to urban environments, tolerating pollution and compacted soils.
