    "intro": "Rubus villicaulis var. flavescentispinus, commonly known as the yellow-spined blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to parts of North America. It is characterized by its thorny stems and yellowish-brown bracts, which distinguish it from other Rubus species. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically edible but have a tart flavor. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and local biodiversity."
