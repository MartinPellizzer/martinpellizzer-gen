    "intro": "Rumex \u00d7 romanicus, commonly known as the hybrid sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant that belongs to the Polygonaceae family. It is a natural hybrid between Rumex acetosa (common sorrel) and Rumex acetobipinatus (broad-leaved sorrel). The plant is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs and have a distinctive sour taste due to the presence of oxalic acid. It typically grows in moist, temperate environments such as meadows, wetlands, and woodland edges. Its flowering stems produce clusters of small, greenish flowers that are followed by triangular, red-brown seeds."
