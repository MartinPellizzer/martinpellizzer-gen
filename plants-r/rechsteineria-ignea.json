    "intro": "Rechsteineria ignea, commonly known as the flame-colored orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant red and orange flowers, which are adorned with intricate patterns that resemble flames. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, humid environments. Its botanical features include strap-like leaves and a compact, pseudobulbous structure typical of many orchid genera. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
