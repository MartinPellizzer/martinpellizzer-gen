It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain toxic seeds, which are a key feature in its botanical classification. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Due to its toxic properties, it is important to handle the plant with care."
