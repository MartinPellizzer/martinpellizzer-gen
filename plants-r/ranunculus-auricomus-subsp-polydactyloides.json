    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus subsp. polydactyloides, commonly known as the golden buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It features showy, yellow flowers with 8 to 12 petals that resemble a cup, and its leaves are deeply lobed with a distinctive, almost fern-like appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and meadows. It is characterized by its stout, hairy stems and is known for its ornamental value in gardens. The subspecies polydactyloides is distinguished by its more numerous petals compared to the typical auricomus."
