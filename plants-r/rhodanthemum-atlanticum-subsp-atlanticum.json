    "intro": "Rhodanthemum atlanticum subsp. atlanticum, commonly known as the Atlantic rhodanthemum, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Atlantic coast. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and vibrant, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow and orange. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to salt-laden air and coastal winds. Its foliage is often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes."
