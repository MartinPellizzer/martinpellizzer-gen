    "intro": "Ranunculus aquatilis f. peucedanifolius, commonly known as the water crowfoot with peucedanifolius foliage, is a variant of the water crowfoot plant. It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its distinctive basal leaves that are deeply lobed and resemble those of the peucedan genus. The plant typically grows in shallow freshwater habitats such as ponds, streams, and wet meadows. Its flowers are small, yellow, and clustered in a loose raceme, often appearing in late spring to early summer. The foliage and flowers are often submerged or partially submerged, adapting to its aquatic or semi-aquatic environment."
