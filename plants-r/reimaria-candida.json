    "intro": "Reimaria candida, commonly known as the white rein orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, pale green to white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories where it relies on specific fungal associations for nutrient uptake. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, and it has a short, underground rhizome system. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Reimaria candida is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
