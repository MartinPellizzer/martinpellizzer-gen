It is characterized by its distinctive, deeply lobed leaves and bright yellow, cup-shaped flowers. The plant thrives in cold, high-altitude environments, often growing in rocky or gravelly soils. Its growth is adapted to harsh climatic conditions, with a short growing season and dormancy during winter. The species is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
