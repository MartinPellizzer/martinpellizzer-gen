    "intro": "Ranunculus pyrenaeus subsp. amplexicaulis, commonly known as the Pyrenean crowfoot, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Pyrenees region. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. The plant features delicate, palmately divided leaves and bright yellow flowers with five petals. It is characterized by its subspecies-specific leaf morphology, where the lower leaves are clasping the stem. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and ecological adaptations."
