    "intro": "Rubus schleicheri var. aciculatus, commonly known as the needle-leaf blackberry, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, spiny stems and small, dark green leaves that are often needle-like in appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by black, edible berries in the summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in high-altitude forests. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
