    "intro": "Racosperma nervosum, commonly known as the narrow-veined acacia, is a shrub native to northern Australia. It features compound leaves with prominent, parallel veins, which are characteristic of the Acacia family. The plant produces yellow globular flower heads that are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. Its woody stems are often covered with a layer of pale, powdery bloom. Racosperma nervosum is adapted to arid environments and is often found in dry sclerophyll forests and coastal dunes."
