    "intro": "Rhamnus capreifolia, commonly known as the European buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring dark green, oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters during late spring, followed by black, egg-shaped berries in the fall. Its bark is smooth and dark brown, often marked with longitudinal ridges. Rhamnus capreifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used historically in traditional medicine."
