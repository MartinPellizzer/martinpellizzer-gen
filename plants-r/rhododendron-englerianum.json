    "intro": "Rhododendron englerianum, commonly known as the Engler's rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in acidic, well-drained soils and thrives in shaded to partially shaded environments. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, providing a striking contrast to its vibrant floral display. This species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in cooler, moist climates."
