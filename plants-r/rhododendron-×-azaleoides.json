    "intro": "Rhododendron \u00d7 azaleoides, commonly known as the cross azalea, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Rhododendron catawbiense and Rhododendron viscosum. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and showy, funnel-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. The plant typically produces leaves that are dark green, leathery, and have a prominent midrib. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to form thickets, contributing to erosion control in suitable environments."
