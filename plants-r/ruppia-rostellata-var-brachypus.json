    "intro": "Ruppia rostellata var. brachypus, commonly known as the short-stalked sea rocket, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments. It is typically found in coastal areas and brackish waters, where it thrives in submerged or emergent conditions. The plant has slender, branching stems and small, alternate leaves that are often submerged. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, producing tiny seeds that are dispersed by water. This variant is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing coastal sediments and supporting aquatic biodiversity."
