It is a cross between Ribes nigrum (black currant) and Ribes rubrum (red currant), resulting in a plant with distinctive botanical features. The leaves are ovate to elliptic, with serrated edges and a dark green upper surface. Its flowers are small, yellow, and clustered in racemes, typical of the genus Ribes. The plant produces small, edible berries that are typically red or yellow, depending on the variety."
