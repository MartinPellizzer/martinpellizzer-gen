    "intro": "Rhus toxicodendron var. rydbergii, commonly known as Rydberg's sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the central and eastern United States. It typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands or along roadsides. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by red, fuzzy fruits that contain several seeds. Its leaves are compound, with three to five leaflets, and they turn bright red in the autumn. The species is related to poison ivy and contains urushiol, a substance that can cause skin irritation in some individuals."
