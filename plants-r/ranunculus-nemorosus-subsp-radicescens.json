It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features small, yellow flowers with five petals, and its leaves are palmately divided with a distinctive hairy texture. It has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread vegetatively. This subspecies is often found in wet meadows and is known for its rapid colonization of disturbed sites."
