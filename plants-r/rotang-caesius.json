    "intro": "Rotang caesius, commonly known as the white mangrove, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rhizophoraceae. It is characterized by its salt-excreting leaves and pneumatophores, which are specialized roots that aid in respiration in waterlogged soils. Native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia, this plant thrives in brackish or saline environments. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and is used in construction and furniture-making. The plant plays an important ecological role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for marine and terrestrial species."
