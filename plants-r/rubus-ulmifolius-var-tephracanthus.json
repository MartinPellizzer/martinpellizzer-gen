    "intro": "Rubus ulmifolius var. tephracanthus, commonly known as the purple-fruited blackberry, is a variant of the common blackberry species. It is characterized by its dark purple to almost black fruits, which are typically larger and more flavorful than those of the standard variety. The plant is a shrub with thorny stems and compound leaves, typical of the Rubus genus. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges and hedgerows. Its botanical significance lies in its unique fruit coloration and its role in local ecosystems."
