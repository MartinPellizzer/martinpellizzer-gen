It is native to parts of eastern North America, particularly the eastern United States and southeastern Canada. The plant is characterized by its thorny stems, compound leaves, and small, dark red to black berries that ripen in the fall. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and thickets. The berries are not typically consumed by humans but are an important food source for birds and small mammals."
