    "intro": "Rubus petrophilus, commonly known as the alpine raspberry, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant produces edible berries that are typically red or black in color, similar to other Rubus species. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific environmental requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized plant."
