    "intro": "Ranunculus nigrescens, commonly known as the black-sheath buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a basal rosette of dark green, hairy leaves that are deeply lobed and often tinged with purple. The plant produces showy yellow flowers with five petals, which are surrounded by numerous sepals. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The species is noted for its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed sites, making it both a common wildflower and a potential weed."
