It is characterized by its dense, thorny growth and dark green, leathery leaves that remain on the plant year-round. The plant produces small, black berries that are typically harvested in late summer. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in coastal regions. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is cultivated in gardens and for local consumption."
