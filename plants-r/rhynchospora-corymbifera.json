    "intro": "Rhynchospora corymbifera, commonly known as the clustered spike-rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and rushes, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences of pale green to reddish-brown flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Rhynchospora corymbifera thrives in moist or aquatic environments, such as marshes and pond edges, and plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, contributing to the ecological structure of its habitat."
