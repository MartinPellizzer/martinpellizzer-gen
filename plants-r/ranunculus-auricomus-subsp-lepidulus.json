    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus subsp. lepidulus, commonly known as the golden buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features bright yellow, cup-shaped flowers with 5-10 petals, and its leaves are deeply lobed with a distinctive, hairy texture. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and thrives in woodland or meadow habitats. It is characterized by its subsp. lepidulus variant, which has a more compact growth habit and slightly smaller flowers compared to the typical form. This species is also noted for its ornamental value in gardens and its role in supporting pollinators."
