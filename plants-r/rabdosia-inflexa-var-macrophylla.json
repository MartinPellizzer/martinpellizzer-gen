    "intro": "Rabdosia inflexa var. macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaved rabdosia, is a species native to Southeast Asia. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically violet or purple in color, arranged in clusters at the ends of the branches. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The leaves and flowers are used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties."
