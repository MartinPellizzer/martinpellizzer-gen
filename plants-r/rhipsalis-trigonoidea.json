    "intro": "Rhipsalis trigonoidea, commonly known as the zigzag cactus, is a species of epiphytic cactus native to Brazil. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems that often form a cascading or shrub-like structure. The plant produces small, white flowers that are typically borne in clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it lacks true leaves, relying on its stems for photosynthesis. Rhipsalis trigonoidea is well adapted to humid, shaded environments and is often cultivated as a houseplant."
