    "intro": "Rhamnus cathartica f. cadevallii, commonly known as the Cadevallii buckthorn, is a botanical variant of the common buckthorn. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and smaller, darker leaves compared to the typical form. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, followed by dark blue berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. This form is less commonly cultivated but is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique morphological traits."
