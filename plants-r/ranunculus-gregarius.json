It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its bright yellow, cup-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Its leaves are deeply lobed and arranged in a basal rosette, while its stems are hairy and often branching. The species is notable for its ability to form dense clusters of flowers, which attract various pollinators."
