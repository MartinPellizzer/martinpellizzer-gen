    "intro": "Ricinocarpus eremorum, commonly known as the desert acacia, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its dense, thorny branches and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain seeds covered in a sticky, resinous substance. It is well adapted to survive in harsh, drought-prone environments due to its deep root system and water-storing capabilities. The plant has traditional uses in local medicine and as a source of fuel and forage."
