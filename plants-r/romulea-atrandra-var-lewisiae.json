    "intro": "Romulea atrandra var. lewisiae, commonly known as the Lewisia's glory-of-the-snow, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It features striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, often with a distinctive purple or brownish tint at the base. The plant produces a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. It blooms in spring, typically from March to May, and is well-suited for rock gardens or well-drained soil. This variant is less commonly cultivated than its parent species, making it a rare and sought-after addition to botanical collections."
