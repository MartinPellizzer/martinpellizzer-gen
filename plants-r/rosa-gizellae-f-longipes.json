It is characterized by its elongated, slender stems and is typically found in horticultural collections rather than the wild. The plant produces fragrant, single or semi-double flowers in shades of pink and white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its foliage consists of dark green, serrated leaves that provide a lush backdrop to the blooms. This cultivar is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
