    "intro": "Rosa fraxinoides, commonly known as the Chinese rose or the everblooming rose, is a shrub native to China and parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and clusters of fragrant, pink to white flowers that bloom continuously throughout the growing season. The plant has small, elliptical leaves with serrated edges, and its flowers are typically borne in groups of three to five. Rosa fraxinoides is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in a variety of soil conditions. It is also valued in traditional Chinese medicine for its purported health benefits."
