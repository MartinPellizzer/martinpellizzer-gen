    "intro": "Rhinanthus crista-galli subsp. humilior, commonly known as the lesser common tickseed, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It has a slender, branched stem and produces small, tubular flowers arranged in a spike. This subspecies is less robust than its close relative, Rhinanthus crista-galli, and is often found in more arid environments."
