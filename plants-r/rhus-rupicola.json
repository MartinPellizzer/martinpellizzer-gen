    "intro": "Rhus rupicola, commonly known as the rock sumac, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are divided into several narrow, pointed leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by bright red, fuzzy berries that are a food source for birds and other wildlife. Rhus rupicola thrives in rocky, arid environments and is adapted to withstand drought and poor soil conditions. Its hardy nature makes it a valuable plant for erosion control in xeriscaped gardens."
