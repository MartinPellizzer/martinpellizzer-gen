It is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia, typically growing in woodland edges and hedgerows. The plant produces small, red, edible hips in the autumn, which are rich in vitamin C. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with serrated edges, and its stems are armed with thorns. This variety is valued for its ornamental beauty and historical use in herbal medicine."
