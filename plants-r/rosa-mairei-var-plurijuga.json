    "intro": "Rosa mairei var. plurijuga, commonly known as the Maire's rose, is a rare and ornamental shrub native to New Zealand. It features compound leaves with five to seven leaflets, each with a serrated margin and a hairy underside. The plant produces fragrant, semi-double pink flowers that bloom in spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and conservation status, it is considered a valuable species in botanical studies."
