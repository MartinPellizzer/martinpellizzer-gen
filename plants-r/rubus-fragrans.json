    "intro": "Rubus fragrans, commonly known as the fragrant raspberry, is a species of bramble native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its trailing or climbing growth habit, with thorny stems and compound leaves that are typically serrated. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits known as drupes, which are often red or yellow when ripe and have a sweet, aromatic flavor. Its flowers are white or pale pink, with five petals and numerous stamens, typical of the Rubus genus. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or coastal areas."
