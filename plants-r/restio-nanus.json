    "intro": "Restio nanus, commonly known as the dwarf restio, is a small, herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Restionaceae family, which includes many grass-like plants adapted to arid and coastal environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny white or pale blue flowers. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in coastal dune habitats. Due to its delicate appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
