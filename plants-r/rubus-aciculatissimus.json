    "intro": "Rubus aciculatissimus, commonly known as the needleleaf blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its sharply pointed, needle-like leaves and thorny stems, which are typical features of the Rubus genus. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black in color when mature. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. Due to its rugged appearance and habitat, it is a notable species within the Rubus family."
