    "intro": "Ranunculus propinquus, commonly known as the small water crowfoot, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to North America. It typically grows in shallow freshwater habitats such as ponds, streams, and wet meadows. The plant has delicate, trifoliate leaves that are often submerged or floating, with small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize the sediment in its aquatic environment. Ranunculus propinquus plays a role in supporting aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and amphibians."
