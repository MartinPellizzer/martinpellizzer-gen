It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant has a woody stem and broad, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in lowland rainforests. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release its seeds, contributing to its propagation in natural habitats."
