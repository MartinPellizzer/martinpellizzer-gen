It features bright yellow flowers with five petal-like sepals, which are often mistaken for true petals. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands. Its leaves are palmately lobed and have a distinctive, hairy texture. It is known for its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes, making it a common weed in disturbed areas."
