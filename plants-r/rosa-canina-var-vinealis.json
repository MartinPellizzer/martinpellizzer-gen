This plant is characterized by its thorny stems that can climb and twine around supports, making it suitable for trellises or fences. Its flowers are typically pink or red, with five petals, and appear in clusters during the summer months. The hips, or fruit, are orange-red and contain a high concentration of vitamin C. It is often found in hedgerows and woodland edges, thriving in well-drained soils."
