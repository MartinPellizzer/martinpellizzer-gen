    "intro": "Rhododendron obtusum f. amoenum, commonly known as the Amoenum rhododendron, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of China. It features dense, leathery foliage with dark green, oval-shaped leaves that provide a striking backdrop for its showy flowers. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, pink to lavender flowers that bloom in early spring, adding a vibrant touch to gardens. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soil and requires partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact size and long-lasting blooms, which attract pollinators and add visual interest throughout the growing season."
