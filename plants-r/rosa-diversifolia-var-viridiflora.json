    "intro": "Rosa diversifolia var. viridiflora, commonly known as the green-flowered shrub rose, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and dark green, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white pubescence. The flowers are typically pale green to yellowish in color, with five to seven petals and a subtle, sweet fragrance. This variety is notable for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in cooler, high-altitude environments. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ecological benefits in native gardens."
