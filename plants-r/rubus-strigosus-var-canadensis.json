    "intro": "Rubus strigosus var. canadensis, commonly known as the Canadian blackberry, is a perennial shrub native to eastern North America. It produces aggregate fruits composed of small, dark red to black drupelets, which are typically eaten by birds and small mammals. The plant has compound leaves with serrated edges and is covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. The species is valued for its edible fruits and is also used in traditional herbal medicine."
