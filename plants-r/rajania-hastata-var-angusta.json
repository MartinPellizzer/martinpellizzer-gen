    "intro": "Rajania hastata var. angusta, commonly known as narrow-leaved Rajania, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and small, pale green to white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and requires partial shade to flourish. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from the rocky soil of its mountainous habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
