    "intro": "Rubus roridus, commonly known as the weeping raspberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, drooping stems and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces red berries in the fall, which are edible but often tart and less commonly consumed than other raspberry varieties. Its leaves are compound, with five to seven oval-shaped leaflets, and the plant thrives in moist, woodland environments. Rubus roridus is also known for its ornamental value due to its delicate, cascading appearance."
