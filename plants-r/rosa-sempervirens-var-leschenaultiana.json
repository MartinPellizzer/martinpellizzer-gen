    "intro": "Rosa sempervirens var. leschenaultiana, commonly known as the Leschenault's evergreen rose, is a shrub-like species native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and dark green, leathery leaves that remain evergreen throughout the year. The plant produces fragrant, semi-double flowers in shades of pink and white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It is well adapted to coastal and rocky environments, thriving in full sun and well-drained soils. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and as a hedge plant."
