    "intro": "Rubus rivularis subsp. angustisetus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved blackberry, is a shrub native to parts of Asia and Australia. It is characterized by its slender, thorny stems and small, dark red to black berries. The leaves are typically narrow and have a serrated margin, which distinguishes it from other Rubus species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. The plant produces flowers with five pink to white petals, which bloom in early spring."
