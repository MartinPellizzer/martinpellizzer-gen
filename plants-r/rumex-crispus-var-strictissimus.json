    "intro": "Rumex crispus var. strictissimus, commonly known as curly dock, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features broad, wavy, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, greenish flowers in dense clusters. The plant is known for its thick, rhizomatous root system, which allows it to spread aggressively in various habitats. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides, in wetlands, and in cultivated fields. Its leaves and roots have been used historically in traditional medicine and as a source of edible greens."
