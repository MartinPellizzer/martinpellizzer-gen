    "intro": "Rosa glauca var. pseudofugax, commonly known as the blue rose or false blue rose, is a rare and striking variant of the Rosa glauca species. It is characterized by its unique blue-purplish hue in its flowers, which is a result of high concentrations of anthocyanin pigments. This variety is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in areas of the Pamir and Tien Shan ranges. The plant typically grows as a shrub with thorny stems and dark green, leathery leaves. It produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom in late summer, making it a sought-after ornamental plant among horticulturists."
