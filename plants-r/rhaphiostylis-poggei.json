    "intro": "Rhaphiostylis poggei, commonly known as the Pogge's starling plant, is a rare flowering plant native to the island of Tonga in the South Pacific. It belongs to the family Cyclanthaceae and is characterized by its unique, star-shaped inflorescences. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are often clustered in a dense, spherical structure. Rhaphiostylis poggei is typically found in coastal or lowland forest habitats, where it thrives in humid, well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species with conservation concerns."
