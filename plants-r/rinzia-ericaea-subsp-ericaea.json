    "intro": "Rinzia ericaea subsp. ericaea, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rinzia, is a small shrub native to south-eastern Australia. It typically grows in heathlands and open forests, thriving in well-drained sandy or rocky soils. The plant features slender, erect stems with narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, bell-shaped flowers are usually pink or pale red, appearing in late spring to early summer. It plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is adapted to the dry, sunny conditions of its habitat."
