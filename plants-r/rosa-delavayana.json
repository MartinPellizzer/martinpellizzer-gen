    "intro": "Rosa delavayana, commonly known as the Delavay rose, is a species native to the mountainous regions of western China. It is characterized by its fragrant, pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows as a shrub, reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters, with thorny stems and dark green, serrated leaves. Its flowers are often used in traditional Chinese medicine and are also appreciated for their ornamental value. Rosa delavayana is valued for its hardiness and ability to thrive in cooler, high-altitude environments."
