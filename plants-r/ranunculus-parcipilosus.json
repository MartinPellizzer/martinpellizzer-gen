    "intro": "Ranunculus parcipilosus, commonly known as the hairy buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features delicate, lobed leaves covered in fine, hairy textures, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
