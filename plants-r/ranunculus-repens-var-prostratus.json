    "intro": "Ranunculus repens var. prostratus, commonly known as the creeping buttercup, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across moist, often disturbed soils. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three heart-shaped leaflets, and the entire plant is often covered in fine, soft hairs. It is commonly found in wet meadows, ditches, and along the edges of water bodies."
