    "intro": "Rosa butleri, commonly known as the Texas meadowblush, is a species of flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in open woodlands and rocky slopes. The plant produces showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets, and it has a woody stem with thornless branches. Rosa butleri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its native habitat."
