    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus subsp. holanthus, commonly known as the yellow pond-lily, is a aquatic plant native to North America. It features floating leaves that are deeply lobed and often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces showy yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late summer. Its roots are anchored in the muddy substrate, allowing it to thrive in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. This subspecies is often found in ponds, lakes, and wetlands, contributing to aquatic biodiversity."
