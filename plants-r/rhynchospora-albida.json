    "intro": "Rhynchospora albida, commonly known as the white root sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in dense spikes, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Rhynchospora albida thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in prairie wetlands and along the edges of lakes and rivers. It plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various insects and small vertebrates."
