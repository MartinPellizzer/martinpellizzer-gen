    "intro": "Racosperma meisneri, commonly known as the Meisner's acacia, is a shrub native to Australia. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod fruits. The plant features small, yellow flowers arranged in dense, globular clusters, which are typical of many acacia species. Its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into two sets of smaller leaflets. Racosperma meisneri is often found in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments."
