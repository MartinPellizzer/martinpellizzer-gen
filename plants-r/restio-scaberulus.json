    "intro": "Restio scaberulus, commonly known as the rough restio, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Restionaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance. The plant has narrow, rigid leaves that are covered in fine, stiff hairs, giving it a rough texture. It typically grows in coastal and sandy environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Restio scaberulus produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny white flowers, which are often overlooked due to their modest size."
