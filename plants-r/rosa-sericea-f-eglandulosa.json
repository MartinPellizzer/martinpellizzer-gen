    "intro": "Rosa sericea f. eglandulosa, commonly known as the silky rose or silverleaf rose, is a horticultural form of the silky rose species. It is characterized by its silvery-white undersides on the leaves, which give it a distinctive, almost metallic appearance. The plant produces fragrant, pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is a compact shrub, typically growing to a height of 1 to 2 meters. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often used in gardens for its aesthetic appeal and hardiness."
