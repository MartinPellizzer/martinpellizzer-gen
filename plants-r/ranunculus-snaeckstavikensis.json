    "intro": "Ranunculus snaeckstavikensis, commonly known as the Snaeckstavik buttercup, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the Arctic regions of Scandinavia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family, characterized by its showy, typically yellow or white flowers with numerous petals. The plant has a short growing season, blooming in late summer to early autumn, and is adapted to cold, nutrient-poor environments. Its leaves are deeply lobed and often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
