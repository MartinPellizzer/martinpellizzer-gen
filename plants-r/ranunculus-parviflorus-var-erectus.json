    "intro": "Ranunculus parviflorus var. erectus, commonly known as the erect yellow buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features delicate, bright yellow flowers with five to eight petals, typically arranged in a cup-like shape. The plant has finely divided, trifoliate leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. This variant is distinguished by its upright growth habit, contrasting with the more spreading form of the typical *R. parviflorus*."
