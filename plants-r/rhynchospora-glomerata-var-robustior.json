    "intro": "Rhynchospora glomerata var. robustior, commonly known as the clustered spike-rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in moist to saturated soils, often found in marshes, swales, and along the edges of ponds. The plant features dense, cylindrical spikelets that are usually reddish-brown in color, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a slightly hairy texture. This variety is notable for its robust growth and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
