    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 pseudoarrigens f. intermedius, commonly known as the intermediate blackberry, is a hybrid plant belonging to the Rosaceae family. It exhibits characteristics of both Rubus ursinus (slippery elm blackberry) and Rubus gebleri (red raspberry), resulting in a unique combination of traits. The plant produces small, dark red to black berries that are typically edible and have a tart flavor. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in shaded, moist environments. Its botanical interest lies in its hybrid origin and the variability in its morphological features."
