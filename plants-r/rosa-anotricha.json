    "intro": "Rosa anotricha, commonly known as the woolly rose, is a species of flowering plant native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering on its stems and leaves, which helps to retain moisture in its native high-altitude environment. The plant produces showy pink to red flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and covered in fine, white hairs. Rosa anotricha is often grown in gardens for its ornamental value and hardy nature."
