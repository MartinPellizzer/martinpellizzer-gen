    "intro": "Rebutia citricarpa, commonly known as the orange-flowered cactus, is a species native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is a low-growing, compact cactus with a thick, ribbed stem that can reach up to 30 cm in height. The plant produces vibrant orange flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking visual contrast to its green foliage. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments. Rebutia citricarpa is well-suited for rock gardens and requires minimal water, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
