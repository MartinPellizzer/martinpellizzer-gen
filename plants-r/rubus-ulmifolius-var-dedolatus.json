    "intro": "Rubus ulmifolius var. dedolatus, commonly known as the creeping blackberry, is a variant of the common blackberry species. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and dark green, serrated leaves that resemble those of the elm tree. The plant produces small, dark purple berries that are typically less showy than those of other Rubus species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas across Europe. This variety is valued for its hardiness and ability to naturalize in suitable conditions."
