    "intro": "Rhynchosia lateritia, commonly known as the African morning glory, is a climbing legume native to tropical Africa. It features heart-shaped, velvety leaves and produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of pink to purple. The plant is characterized by its ability to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to harsh conditions. Its seeds are enclosed in pods and can remain viable for several years, contributing to its persistence in the wild. Rhynchosia lateritia is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
