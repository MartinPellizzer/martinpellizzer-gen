    "intro": "Rhynchocorys elephas subsp. hirtula, commonly known as the hairy rhynchocorys, is a lesser-known species within the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which distinguish it from other subspecies of Rhynchocorys. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate regions. Its flowers are small and clustered, producing a subtle fragrance that attracts pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
