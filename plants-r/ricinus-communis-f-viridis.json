    "intro": "Ricinus communis f. viridis, commonly known as the green castor plant, is a variant of the castor oil plant characterized by its distinct green foliage. This plant is a herbaceous annual with palmately lobed leaves that are typically a vibrant green, contrasting with the more common reddish or purplish hues of the standard castor plant. It produces spiny capsules containing toxic seeds, similar to its parent species. The green castor plant is often cultivated as an ornamental due to its striking leaf color and unique appearance. It thrives in warm climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
