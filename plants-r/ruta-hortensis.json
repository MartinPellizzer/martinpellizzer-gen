    "intro": "Ruta hortensis, commonly known as garden rue, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features aromatic, dark green, fern-like leaves and yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer. The plant contains volatile oils and alkaloids, which contribute to its strong, sometimes bitter scent. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy addition to gardens. Its historical use in herbal medicine and as a natural insect repellent highlights its botanical and practical significance."
