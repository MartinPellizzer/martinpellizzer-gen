    "intro": "Rubus hirtus subvar. reussii, commonly known as the prickly rose or rough blackberry, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its thorny stems, trifoliate leaves, and aggregate fruits that mature into dark purple or black berries. The plant is native to North America, particularly the eastern United States, and thrives in woodland and hedgerow environments. It produces white flowers in the spring and is often found growing in partial shade. The subvariety reussii is distinguished by its more robust growth and denser thorn coverage compared to other Rubus species."
