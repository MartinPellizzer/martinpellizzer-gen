    "intro": "Rubus obscurus var. subentomodontus, commonly known as the dark raspberry variant, is a shrub native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its small, dark red berries that are typically less showy than those of other Rubus species. The plant has trifoliate leaves with serrated edges and produces clusters of white flowers in the spring. It thrives in woodland edges and moist, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
