    "intro": "Rhododendron lasiopodum, commonly known as the woolly rhododendron, is a species native to the Himalayas, particularly in regions of India, Nepal, and Bhutan. It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are elliptical, leathery, and often have a bluish-gray underside. Rhododendron lasiopodum thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in mountainous forested areas."
