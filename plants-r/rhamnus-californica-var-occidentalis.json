It is characterized by its small, dark green leaves and yellowish-white flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces small, reddish berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in coastal environments and is often found in sandy or gravelly soils. Its botanical features make it well adapted to the temperate and often windy conditions of its native habitat."
