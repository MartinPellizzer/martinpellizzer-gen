    "intro": "Rhynchospora glomerata var. minor, commonly known as the small clustered spike-rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical inflorescence that bears small, pale brown flowers. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils. Its leaves are grass-like, narrow, and often have a slight reddish tinge. This variety is often found in association with other wetland plants, contributing to the ecological diversity of its habitat."
