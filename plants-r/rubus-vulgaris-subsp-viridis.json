    "intro": "Rubus vulgaris subsp. viridis, commonly known as the green bramble, is a shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, thorny stems and trifoliate leaves that are usually a vibrant green. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in the spring, followed by red, hairy berries in the autumn. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including woodlands, hedgerows, and disturbed soils. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become a weed in agricultural and natural areas."
