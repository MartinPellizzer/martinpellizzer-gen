    "intro": "Ribes pumilum, commonly known as creeping gooseberry, is a low-growing shrub native to North America. It produces small, yellow or orange berries that are edible and often used in jams and preserves. The plant has slender, arching stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. Its leaves are ovate with serrated edges and a slightly hairy texture. Ribes pumilum thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks."
