    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 foedus, commonly known as the blackberry raspberry hybrid, is a deciduous shrub that belongs to the Rosaceae family. It is a natural hybrid between Rubus ursinus (blackberry) and Rubus idaeus (raspberry), resulting in a plant that exhibits characteristics of both parents. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically reddish-black when mature, with a tart and slightly sweet flavor. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for both ornamental and culinary purposes."
