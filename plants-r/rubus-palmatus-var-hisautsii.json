    "intro": "Rubus palmatus var. hisautsii, commonly known as the hisautsii raspberry, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red when ripe, though they may vary in color depending on the variety. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within the Rubus genus."
