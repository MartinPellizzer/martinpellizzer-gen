    "intro": "Rhinactina, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the remote highlands of South America. It is characterized by its translucent, bell-shaped flowers that emit a faint bioluminescent glow at night. The plant's leaves are broad and waxy, adapted to conserve moisture in its arid habitat. Rhinactina is known for its unique ability to absorb and store sunlight during the day, which it uses for photosynthesis. Due to its elusive nature and limited distribution, it is considered a critically endangered species."
