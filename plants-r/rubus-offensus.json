    "intro": "Rubus offensus, commonly known as the stinking raspberry, is a species of brambles native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, usually red or yellow flowers. The plant produces aggregate fruits, which are typically red and have a distinctive, often unpleasant odor. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Due to its strong scent, it is often avoided by both humans and animals."
