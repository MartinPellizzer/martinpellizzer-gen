    "intro": "Rosa glauca var. malmundariensis, commonly known as the Malmundariensian blue rose, is a rare and highly sought-after cultivar of the Rosa glauca species. It is characterized by its striking, deep blue petals, which are a result of unique pigmentation caused by the presence of delphinidin. This variety is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and is known for its cold hardiness and ability to thrive in well-drained soil. The plant typically grows as a shrub with thorny stems and produces fragrant, semi-double flowers in early summer. Due to its rarity and aesthetic appeal, it is often cultivated in specialized gardens and botanical collections."
