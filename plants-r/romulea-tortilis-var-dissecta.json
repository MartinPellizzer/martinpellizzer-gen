It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces elegant, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange. The plant is characterized by its finely dissected foliage, which gives it a delicate, fern-like appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value in rock gardens and as a specimen plant."
