    "intro": "Rubus grossularia, commonly known as the blackberry plant, is a species of brambles native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its thorny stems, trifoliate leaves, and aggregate fruits that develop from multiple ovaria. The berries, which are typically dark purple to black in color, are rich in antioxidants and have a tart flavor. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. It plays an important role in ecosystems by providing food for wildlife and supporting pollinators."
