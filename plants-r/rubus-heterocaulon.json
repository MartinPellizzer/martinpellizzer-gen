    "intro": "Rubus heterocaulon, commonly known as the alpine blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its erect or scrambling growth habit and produces small, dark berries that are typically edible. The plant has compound leaves with serrated edges and white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value and edible fruits."
