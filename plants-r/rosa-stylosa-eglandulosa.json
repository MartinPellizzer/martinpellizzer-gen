    "intro": "Rosa stylosa eglandulosa, commonly known as the glandless evergreen rose, is a shrub native to the eastern United States. It features small, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine, silvery hairs. The plant produces fragrant, single or semi-double flowers in shades of pink, red, and white. It is characterized by its lack of glandular hairs, which distinguishes it from other rose species. This plant is well-suited for moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sun."
