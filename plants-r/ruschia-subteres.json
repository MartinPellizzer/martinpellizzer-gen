    "intro": "Ruschia subteres, commonly known as the narrow-leaf Ruschia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features small, fleshy, narrow leaves that are typically green with a reddish tinge, especially when exposed to sunlight. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the warmer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor gardening."
