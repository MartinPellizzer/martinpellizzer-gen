    "intro": "Rubus macrophyllus var. piletostachys, commonly known as the giant evergreen raspberry, is a variant of the evergreen bramble native to China. It is characterized by its large, leathery leaves that can reach up to 20 cm in length. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in spring, which are followed by red, edible berries in late summer. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in moist, shaded woodland areas. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
