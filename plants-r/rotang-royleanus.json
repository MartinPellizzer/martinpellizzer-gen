    "intro": "Rotang royleanus, commonly known as the Philippine rosewood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia, particularly the Philippines. It is characterized by its dark, dense wood that is highly valued for its aesthetic and structural properties. The plant has compound leaves with long, slender leaflets and produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland and hill forests. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
