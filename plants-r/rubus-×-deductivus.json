    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 deductivus, commonly known as the hybrid blackberry raspberry, is a botanical hybrid resulting from the cross between Rubus ursinus (blackberry) and Rubus idaeus (raspberry). It exhibits characteristics of both parent species, with dark red to black berries that are typically larger than those of pure species. The plant is a deciduous shrub with arching canes and compound leaves, often found in temperate regions. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun for optimal fruit production. Due to its hybrid nature, it is generally not found in the wild and is cultivated for its unique flavor and ornamental value."
