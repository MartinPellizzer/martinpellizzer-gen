It features dark green, leathery leaves that are deeply lobed, giving it a distinctive, fern-like appearance. The plant produces fragrant, single or semi-double pink flowers in late spring to early summer. It is well adapted to dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for rock gardens and small spaces."
