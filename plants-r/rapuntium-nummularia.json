    "intro": "Rapuntium nummularia, commonly known as silverweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features a rosette of spoon-shaped, silver-green leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in the summer, which are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, stream banks, and disturbed areas. Silverweed is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported health benefits."
