    "intro": "Rhamnus valentina, commonly known as the Valentina buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to the Caucasus region. It typically grows to a height of 2 to 4 meters and features small, dark green leaves that turn reddish in autumn. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in the spring, followed by black, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds. Its bark is smooth and grayish, with distinctive ridges that become more pronounced with age. Rhamnus valentina is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its seasonal interest."
