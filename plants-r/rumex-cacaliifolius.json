    "intro": "Rumex cacaliifolius, commonly known as the broad-leaved sorrel, is a perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features upright stems with alternate, broadly ovate to heart-shaped leaves that are often reddish in color. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are borne on slender pedicels. Its leaves are edible and have a sour taste due to the presence of oxalic acid. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks."
