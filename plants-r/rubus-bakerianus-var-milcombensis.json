    "intro": "Rubus bakerianus var. milcombensis, commonly known as the Milcombe raspberry, is a shrub native to the British Isles. It is characterized by its erect or spreading growth habit and has trifoliate leaves with serrated margins. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red when ripe. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodland or hedgerow habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and locally important species in its native range."
