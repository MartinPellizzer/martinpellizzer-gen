    "intro": "Ranunculus glacialis var. minimus, commonly known as the dwarf glacier buttercup, is a low-growing perennial herb native to alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features small, bright yellow flowers with five to eight petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or scree habitats. Due to its delicate nature, it is sensitive to environmental changes and is considered a rare and fragile species."
