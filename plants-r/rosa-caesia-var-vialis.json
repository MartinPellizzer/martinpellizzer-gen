It features slender, arching stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats or small bushes. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink to white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are compound, with ovate to elliptic leaflets that are covered in fine, soft hairs. Rosa caesia var. vialis is well-suited for rock gardens or as ground cover due to its hardy nature and ornamental value."
