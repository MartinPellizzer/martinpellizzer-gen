It features delicate, palmately divided leaves and bright yellow, cup-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, woodland habitats and has a short, unbranched stem. Its flowers are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The species is characterized by its smooth, hairless stems and leaves, which distinguish it from other ranunculus varieties."
