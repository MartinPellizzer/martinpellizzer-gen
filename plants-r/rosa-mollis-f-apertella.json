It features semi-woody stems with thorns and heart-shaped, serrated leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The flowers are typically pink to white, with a flared appearance due to the open, spreading petals. This cultivar is prized for its ornamental value in gardens and its ability to thrive in temperate climates. It requires well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight for optimal growth and blooming."
