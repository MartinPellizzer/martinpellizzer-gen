    "intro": "Rosa canina f. collina, commonly known as the creeping dog\u73ab\u7470, is a hemicryptophyte shrub characterized by its low-growing habit and thorny stems. It features simple, pinnately compound leaves with serrated margins, typically arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces pink to red flowers in clusters, which are followed by orange-red, fuzzy hips that contain seeds. It is native to Europe and western Asia, often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. This form is distinguished by its prostrate growth and is adapted to colonize disturbed soils."
