    "intro": "Rosa tomentosa subvar. subadenophylla, commonly known as the woolly rose, is a shrub-like plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, grayish-white pubescence covering the stems and leaves, giving it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The leaves are typically pinnately compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The flowers are usually pale pink to white, with five petals and numerous stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique texture and fragrance."
