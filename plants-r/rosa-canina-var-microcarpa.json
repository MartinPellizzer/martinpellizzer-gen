    "intro": "Rosa canina var. microcarpa, commonly known as the small-fruited dog rose, is a variant of the dog rose species native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and smaller, more delicate flowers compared to the typical Rosa canina. The plant produces small, red berries that are typically less than 1 cm in diameter, which are edible but often used more for ornamental purposes. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun, making it suitable for garden cultivation. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in hedgerows and wildlife habitats."
