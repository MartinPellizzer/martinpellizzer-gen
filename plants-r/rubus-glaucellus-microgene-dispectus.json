    "intro": "Rubus glaucellus microgene dispectus, commonly known as the alpine raspberry, is a rare and specialized plant species native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered inflorescences and hairy, glandular leaves. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its flowers are typically pink or white, and it produces small, edible berries that are adapted to the harsh conditions of its habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
