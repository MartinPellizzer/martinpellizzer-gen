    "intro": "Ribes longeracemosum var. gracillimum, commonly known as the slender currant, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It features slender, arching branches covered with small, oval leaves that have a slightly serrated edge. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by edible, red berries in late summer. Its foliage is often used in traditional medicine for its astringent properties. The shrub thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and woodland edges."
