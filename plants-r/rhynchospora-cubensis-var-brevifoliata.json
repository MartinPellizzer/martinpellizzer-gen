    "intro": "Rhynchospora cubensis var. brevifoliata, commonly known as the short-leaved flat sedge, is a perennial herb native to the wetlands of the Caribbean, particularly Cuba and parts of Florida. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, clustered flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, thriving in marshy environments. Its inflorescence consists of a dense spike of pale green to brownish flowers, which are wind-pollinated. This species plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
