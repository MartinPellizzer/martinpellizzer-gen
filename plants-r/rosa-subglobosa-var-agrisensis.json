It features dense, rounded foliage and produces fragrant, semi-double pink flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant has small, oval leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white pubescence, giving it a soft, velvety appearance. It is well adapted to cold climates and thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. This variety is often used in rock gardens and as a decorative plant in alpine settings."
