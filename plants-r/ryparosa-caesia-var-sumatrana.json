    "intro": "Ryparosa caesia var. sumatrana, commonly known as the Sumatran orchid, is a flowering plant native to the Indonesian island of Sumatra. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in its tropical rainforest habitat. Its leaves are narrow and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), adapted to reduce water loss in the humid, shaded environment where it grows. This variety is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts."
