    "intro": "Rubus chlorothyrsos var. silingicus, commonly known as the Silingikus blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to specific regions in Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically harvested in late summer. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and partial sunlight. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and somewhat obscure species within the Rubus genus."
