    "intro": "Rourea solanderi, commonly known as the Solander's rourea, is a flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia, including Indonesia and Papua New Guinea. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, often found in moist, shaded forest environments. Its leaves are thick and waxy, which helps it retain water in its native habitat. Rourea solanderi is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
