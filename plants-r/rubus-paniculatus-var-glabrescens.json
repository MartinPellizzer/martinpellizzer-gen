    "intro": "Rubus paniculatus var. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth-leaf raspberry, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its slender, arching stems and clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that appear in late spring. The leaves are alternate, palmately compound, and typically have five to seven leaflets that are smooth and glossy. The plant produces red, hairy berries that ripen in the summer, which are edible but often tart. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and thickets."
