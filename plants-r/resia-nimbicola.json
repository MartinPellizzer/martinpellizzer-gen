    "intro": "Resia nimbicola, commonly known as the cloud forest mist plant, is a unique species native to the high-altitude cloud forests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its delicate, elongated leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its humid environment. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale green, adapted for pollination by insects rather than wind. Its root system is shallow and fibrous, allowing it to absorb nutrients from the nutrient-poor soils of its habitat. Resia nimbicola plays a vital role in the ecosystem by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
