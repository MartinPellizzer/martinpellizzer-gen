It is characterized by its slender, thorny stems and small, elliptical leaves with a distinct midrib. The plant produces aggregate fruits composed of tiny, dark purple to black achenes. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and woodlands. Its botanical features make it distinguishable from other Rubus species, particularly in its leaf morphology and fruit structure."
