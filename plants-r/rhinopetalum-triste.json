    "intro": "Rhinopetalum triste, commonly known as the sad rhinopetalum, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the humid forests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often drooping stems and small, pale greenish-white flowers that bloom during the rainy season. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and requires high humidity and well-drained soil to flourish. Its leaves are elongated and have a waxy texture, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Rhinopetalum triste is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
