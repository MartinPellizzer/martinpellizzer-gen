It is characterized by its dark, almost black stems and leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, tart blackberries that are typically harvested in late summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Botanically, it belongs to the Rubus genus within the Rosaceae family, which includes many other brambles and shrubs."
