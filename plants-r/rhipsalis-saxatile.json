    "intro": "Rhipsalis saxatile, commonly known as the rock candelabra cactus, is a unique species native to South America. It is characterized by its branched, upright stems that resemble a candelabra, often covered in small, white spines. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming during the warmer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect light to flourish. Due to its striking appearance and relatively low maintenance, it is a popular choice for indoor cultivation."
