    "intro": "Ricinocarpos psilocladus, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the family Myrtaceae and is characterized by its aromatic, reddish-brown heartwood. The plant typically grows as a tree or shrub, with narrow, lance-shaped leaves and small, white or pink flowers. Its seeds are enclosed in woody capsules, and the plant is valued for its durable, high-quality timber. However, due to overharvesting, it is now considered a vulnerable species in its natural habitat."
