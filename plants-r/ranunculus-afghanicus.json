It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family, which includes many showy and often toxic species. The plant features delicate, palmate leaves and bright yellow or white flowers with numerous petals. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species."
