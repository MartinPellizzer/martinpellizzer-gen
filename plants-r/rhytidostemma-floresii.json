    "intro": "Rhytidostemma floresii, commonly known as the Flores Island cycad, is a rare cycad species native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feather-like leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, typical of cycads, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. It thrives in humid, tropical environments and is adapted to grow in well-drained soils. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists."
