    "intro": "Restrepia ujarensis, commonly known as the Ujarensis orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the humid cloud forests of Colombia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, pseudobulbous structure with narrow, elongated leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink, typically blooming during the wet season. It thrives in high-altitude environments with high humidity and dappled sunlight. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
