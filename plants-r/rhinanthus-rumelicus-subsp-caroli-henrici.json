    "intro": "Rhinanthus rumelicus subsp. caroli-henrici, commonly known as the Caroli-Henrici's yellow rattle, is a flowering plant in the Orobanchaceae family. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially depends on host plants for water and nutrients. The plant typically grows in open grasslands and meadows, often in nutrient-poor soils. It produces bright yellow flowers that bloom from June to August. Its presence is an indicator of well-managed, biodiverse habitats."
