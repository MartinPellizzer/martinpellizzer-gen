    "intro": "Rubus inflatus, commonly known as the inflated blackberry, is a species of bramble native to certain regions of North America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that are typically pink or white in color. The fruit, which is a type of aggregate fruit, is notably larger and more inflated than that of other Rubus species. The plant produces thorny stems and has palmately compound leaves with five to seven leaflets. It thrives in moist, woodland habitats and is often found in shaded areas with well-drained soil."
