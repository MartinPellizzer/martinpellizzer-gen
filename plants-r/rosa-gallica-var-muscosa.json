    "intro": "Rosa gallica var. muscosa, commonly known as the mossy rose, is a perennial shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, velvety leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of moss, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early summer. It is well adapted to moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is a popular choice for garden cultivation."
