    "intro": "Ranunculus guelzowiensis, commonly known as the Guelzow's buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America. It features delicate, palmately divided leaves and bright yellow flowers with five petals, typical of the Ranunculaceae family. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its flowers bloom in early spring, adding a vibrant touch to its natural habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
