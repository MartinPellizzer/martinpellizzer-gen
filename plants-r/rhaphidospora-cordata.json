    "intro": "Rhaphidospora cordata, commonly known as the heartleaf fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, heart-shaped fronds that are often deeply lobed. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce both roots and new shoots, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The fronds are usually a dark green color and can reach lengths of up to 30 centimeters."
