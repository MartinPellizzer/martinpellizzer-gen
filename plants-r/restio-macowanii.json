It belongs to the Restionaceae family, which includes many grass-like plants adapted to arid and coastal environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny white or pale blue flowers. It is often found growing in sandy or rocky soils along coastal areas and is well adapted to salt spray and strong winds. Restio macowanii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
