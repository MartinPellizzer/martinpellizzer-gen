    "intro": "Rubus groutianus, commonly known as the Grout's blackberry, is a species of shrub native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its thorny stems and aggregate fruits. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically edible. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and partial sunlight. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and somewhat obscure member of the Rubus genus."
