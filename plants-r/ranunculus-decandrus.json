    "intro": "Ranunculus decandrus, commonly known as the nine-petaled buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a short, hairy stem that supports a single, showy flower with nine bright yellow petals and a dark brown center. The plant has trifoliate basal leaves with serrated edges, and its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
