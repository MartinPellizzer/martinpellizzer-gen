    "intro": "Raspalia palustris, commonly known as the marsh raspalia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments. It features slender, upright stems that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and have a slightly serrated edge. Raspalia palustris thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds."
