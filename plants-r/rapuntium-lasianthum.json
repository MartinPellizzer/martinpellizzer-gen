    "intro": "Rapuntium lasianthum, commonly known as the woolly bellflower, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green foliage and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or dry soils and is often found in alpine or mountainous regions. It produces small, round seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
