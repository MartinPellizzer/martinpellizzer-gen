    "intro": "Rumex pulcher subsp. cassius, commonly known as the purple-stemmed sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive purple-tinged stems and heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are typically borne on tall, slender stalks. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or grassland habitats. The leaves are edible and have a tangy, sour flavor, making it a potential forage plant in certain regions."
