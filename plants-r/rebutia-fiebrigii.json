    "intro": "Rebutia fiebrigii, commonly known as the Fiebrig's euphorbia, is a species of flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences called cyathia. Its foliage consists of thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, a feature that helps it survive in arid environments. Rebutia fiebrigii is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
