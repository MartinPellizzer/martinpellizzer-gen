    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus subsp. rotundelliformis, commonly known as the roundleaf buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its palmate, deeply lobed leaves that are typically rounded in shape, giving it its subspecies name. The plant produces showy yellow flowers with five sepals that are often reflexed backward, resembling small cups. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain environments."
