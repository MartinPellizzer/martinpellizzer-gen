    "intro": "Rhodax allionii, commonly known as the Allion's rhodax, is a rare and endemic plant species found in specific regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, compound leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of its family. It thrives in rocky or calcareous soils and is often found in mountainous or coastal areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Rhodax allionii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
