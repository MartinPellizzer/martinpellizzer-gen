    "intro": "Rotala rotundifolia var. macrandra, commonly known as the broad-leaf water lettuce, is a floating aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It features rounded, waxy leaves that are typically bright green and arranged in rosettes on the water's surface. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often submerged, followed by small, round fruits. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments and is often used in aquascaping for its ornamental value. Its rapid growth rate makes it both a useful and potentially invasive species in aquatic ecosystems."
