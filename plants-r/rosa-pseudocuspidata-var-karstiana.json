    "intro": "Rosa pseudocuspidata var. karstiana, commonly known as the Karstian rose, is a rare and ornamental species native to specific regions of China. It is characterized by its slender, thorny stems and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant produces oval, hairy leaves with serrated edges, typical of many rose species. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and unique botanical features, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
