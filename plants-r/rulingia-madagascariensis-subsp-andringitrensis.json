    "intro": "Rulingia madagascariensis subsp. andringitrensis, commonly known as the Andringitra rulingia, is a rare endemic plant found exclusively in the eastern rainforests of Madagascar. It is a woody shrub or small tree that typically grows in humid, shaded environments. The plant features simple, elliptical leaves with a smooth texture and a dark green upper surface. Its flowers are small and white, arranged in clusters, and it produces fleshy, red berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered critically endangered."
