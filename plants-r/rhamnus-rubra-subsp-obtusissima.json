    "intro": "Rhamnus rubra subsp. obtusissima, commonly known as the blunt-leaved buckthorn, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and oval, leathery leaves that are typically obtuse at the tip. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by dark blue berries that are an important food source for birds. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in chaparral and woodland habitats. The subspecies is distinguished by its more rounded leaf shape compared to other forms of Rhamnus rubra."
