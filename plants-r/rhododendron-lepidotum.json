    "intro": "Rhododendron lepidotum, commonly known as the alpine rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of East Asia, particularly China, Korea, and Japan. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows in cool, moist environments at high altitudes. The plant features dense, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Its flowers are usually pink to purple, appearing in clusters and blooming in late spring to early summer. Rhododendron lepidotum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural growing conditions."
