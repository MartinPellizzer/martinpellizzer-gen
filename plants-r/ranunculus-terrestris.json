    "intro": "Ranunculus terrestris, commonly known as the creeping buttercup, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features bright yellow flowers with five to eight petals, typically blooming in early spring. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit, with stems that spread along the ground and produce numerous small, rounded leaves. Its flowers are often accompanied by two small, leaf-like sepals, and it produces fluffy, white seed heads that release tiny seeds by wind. Ranunculus terrestris thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, gardens, and along stream banks."
