    "intro": "Rhynchospora pubera var. microcarpa, commonly known as the small-fruited beakgrass, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, three-lobed flowers, typical of the genus Rhynchospora. Its leaves are narrow and often covered with fine hairs, and it thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils. This variety is distinguished by its smaller, more compact fruits compared to other varieties within the species."
