It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and streams. The plant has small, alternate leaves that are usually submerged or floating, with tiny white flowers that appear in clusters. It is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in nutrient-rich water environments. Rorippa nudiuscula is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its role in stabilizing water bodies and providing habitat for aquatic life."
