    "intro": "Rosa mollis subf. gyropsis, commonly known as the Gyropsis rose, is a subspecies of the shrub rose characterized by its dense, thorny stems and clusters of fragrant, pale pink to white flowers. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. The plant produces small, oval-shaped leaves with serrated edges, and its flowers typically bloom in late spring to early summer. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and hardy nature, though it requires regular pruning to maintain its shape. The subspecies is distinguished by its unique floral structure and compact growth habit compared to other Rosa species."
