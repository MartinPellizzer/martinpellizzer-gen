    "intro": "Rosa canina f. albolutescens, commonly known as the white-leaf dog rose, is a botanical variant of the common dog rose. It is characterized by its pale white leaves and flowers, which distinguish it from the typical pink or red blooms of the species. This form is typically found in the wild, often in open woodlands or along hedgerows. The plant produces small, red hips that are rich in vitamin C. Its foliage and flowers contribute to its ornamental value, making it a sought-after plant in horticulture."
