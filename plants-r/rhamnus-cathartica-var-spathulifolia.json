    "intro": "Rhamnus cathartica var. spathulifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved buckthorn, is a shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its lanceolate to ovate leaves that are often broader than those of the typical Rhamnus cathartica. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by dark blue, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds. It thrives in a variety of soils but prefers well-drained, loamy conditions. The species is also noted for its medicinal properties, historically used for its laxative effects."
