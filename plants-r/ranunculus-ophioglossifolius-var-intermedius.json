    "intro": "Ranunculus ophioglossifolius var. intermedius, commonly known as the intermediate water crowfoot, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, nodding yellow flowers and trifoliate leaves that are often submerged or floating on water surfaces. The plant thrives in shallow freshwater habitats such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. Its leaves are typically divided into three leaflets, with the terminal leaflet being longer and more elongated. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
