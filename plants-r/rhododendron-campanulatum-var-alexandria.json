    "intro": "Rhododendron campanulatum var. alexandria, commonly known as the Alexandrine campanula rhododendron, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It features lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy, with a dense, compact growth habit. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. It prefers acidic, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value comes from both its foliage and the showy, long-lasting blooms."
