    "intro": "Rubus rosaceus var. scabripes, commonly known as the rough-leaved blackberry, is a perennial shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its prickly stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that ripen to a dark purple or black color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Due to its hardiness and edible fruits, it is both ecologically and economically significant."
