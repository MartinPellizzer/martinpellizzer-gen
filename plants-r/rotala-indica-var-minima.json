    "intro": "Rotala indica var. minima, commonly known as the dwarf waterwheel plant, is a small aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and whorled arrangement of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically produces small, white flowers that are clustered in whorls along the stems. It thrives in shallow freshwater environments and is often used in pond landscaping for its ornamental value. Due to its slow growth rate, it is well-suited for controlled cultivation in aquariums and garden ponds."
