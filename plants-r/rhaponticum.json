It consists of several species, most notably Rhaponticum carthamoides, which is native to central and eastern Europe. These plants are characterized by their rosette-forming leaves and showy yellow or orange composite flower heads. They thrive in temperate climates and are often found in meadows and grasslands. Rhaponticum species are valued for their ornamental appeal and have also been used in traditional medicine."
