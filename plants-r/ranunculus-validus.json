    "intro": "Ranunculus validus, commonly known as the alpine buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features a basal rosette of finely divided, bright green leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white hairs. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and subalpine habitats. Due to its delicate structure and specific environmental requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator of high-altitude ecosystems."
