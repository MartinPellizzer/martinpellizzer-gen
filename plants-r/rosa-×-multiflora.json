    "intro": "Rosa \u00d7 multiflora, commonly known as the multiflora rose, is a hybrid shrub native to East Asia. It is characterized by its dense, thorny growth habit and clusters of fragrant pink or white flowers. The plant produces numerous small, red, berry-like fruits that are edible but often considered invasive in many regions. Its leaves are compound, with five to seven oval leaflets, and it thrives in a variety of soil types. Rosa \u00d7 multiflora is widely used in landscaping but can outcompete native vegetation if not managed carefully."
