    "intro": "Rosa micrantha subvar. brachycephala, commonly known as the dwarf rose or small-headed rose, is a compact shrub native to the mountainous regions of China. It features narrow, arching stems with simple, ovate to elliptical leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of soft hairs. The flowers are small, usually pink or white, and borne singly or in clusters, adding a delicate ornamental quality to the plant. It is a deciduous species, shedding its leaves in the autumn, and is valued for its hardiness and ability to thrive in cooler climates. This variety is often cultivated in gardens for its modest beauty and ease of care."
