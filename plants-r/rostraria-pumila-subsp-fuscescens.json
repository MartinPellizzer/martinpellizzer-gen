    "intro": "Rostraria pumila subsp. fuscescens, commonly known as the slender rostraria, is a small, herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white to pale pink flowers in late spring to early summer. Its flowers are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences, and the species is noted for its delicate, rosette-like growth habit. Rostraria pumila subsp. fuscescens is often found in association with other wetland plants, contributing to the biodiversity of its ecosystem."
