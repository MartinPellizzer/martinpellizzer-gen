    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 exacutus, commonly known as the evergreen blackberry, is a hybrid shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its thorny stems, trifoliate leaves, and dark purple to black berries that ripen in late summer. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and edible fruits, though the berries are generally tart and less sweet than those of other blackberry species. The plant plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing food for wildlife and habitat for various insects."
