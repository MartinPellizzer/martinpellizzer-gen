The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as mountainous regions and cloud forests. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense clumps and spread vegetatively. Rumohra trianae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic qualities."
