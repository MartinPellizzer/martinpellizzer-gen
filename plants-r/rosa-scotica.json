    "intro": "Rosa scotica, commonly known as the Scottish rose, is a rare and endangered species native to the Scottish Highlands. It is a shrub with simple, alternate leaves and produces fragrant, pink or white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils and is often found in heathland and woodland habitats. It is characterized by its thorny stems and is closely related to other members of the Rosa genus. Due to habitat loss and climate change, Rosa scotica faces significant conservation challenges."
