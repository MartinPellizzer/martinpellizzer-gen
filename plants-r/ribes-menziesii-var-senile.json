    "intro": "Ribes menziesii var. senile, commonly known as the silverleaf currant, is a deciduous shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its striking silvery-gray foliage, which provides a striking contrast to its deep green stems. The plant produces small, edible berries that ripen to a dark red or purple color in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sun, making it suitable for garden cultivation. Its ornamental value and adaptability make it a popular choice for both landscape design and ecological restoration projects."
