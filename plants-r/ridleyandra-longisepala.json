    "intro": "Ridleyandra longisepala, commonly known as the long-sepaled ridleyandra, is a rare and unique plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants, and is characterized by its distinctive floral morphology. The species is notable for its elongated sepals that are often as long as or longer than the petals, giving it a striking appearance. Its leaves are typically large, palmately lobed, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ridleyandra longisepala is considered a botanically significant but poorly understood species."
