    "intro": "Rebutia dutineana, commonly known as the Desert Rose, is a species of flowering cactus native to South America, particularly Argentina and Chile. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and its ability to produce vibrant, showy flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red. The plant features a dense covering of spines, which provide protection from herbivores and extreme weather conditions. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stems. Rebutia dutineana thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth and flowering."
