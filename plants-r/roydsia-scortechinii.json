    "intro": "Roydsia scortechinii, commonly known as the St. Helena endemic, is a rare flowering plant native to the island of St. Helena in the South Atlantic Ocean. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant has adapted to the unique microclimate of its habitat, featuring succulent leaves that help conserve water. Its botanical significance lies in its restricted distribution and potential role in understanding island biogeography. Due to its limited range and habitat vulnerability, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
