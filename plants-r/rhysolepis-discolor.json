    "intro": "Rhysolepis discolor, commonly known as the silverleaf maple, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are doubly serrated and have a silvery underside. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras for seed dispersal. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age. The plant is often found in moist, well-drained soils in forests and along streambanks."
