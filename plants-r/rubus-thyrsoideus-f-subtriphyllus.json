    "intro": "Rubus thyrsoideus f. subtriphyllus, commonly known as the three-leaf raspberry, is a botanical variant of the common raspberry. It is characterized by its distinctive trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets arranged in a fan-like pattern. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red when ripe, similar to other Rubus species. It is often found in temperate regions, growing in woodland edges or disturbed soils. This form is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
