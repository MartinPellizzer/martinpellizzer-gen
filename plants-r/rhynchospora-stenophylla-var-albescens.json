    "intro": "Rhynchospora stenophylla var. albescens, commonly known as the white-flowered marsh sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that grow in dense clusters. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically borne on the upper part of the stem. It thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. This variety is distinguished by its pale floral coloration, which sets it apart from other varieties of Rhynchospora stenophylla."
