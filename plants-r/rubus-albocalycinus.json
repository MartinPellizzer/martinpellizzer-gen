    "intro": "Rubus albocalycinus, commonly known as the white-fruited blackberry, is a species of brambles native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by edible berries that are typically pale yellow or white in color. These berries are often used in local cuisines and traditional medicine. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
