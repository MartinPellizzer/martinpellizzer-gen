    "intro": "Rhamnus elegans, commonly known as the elegant buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and lance-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in the spring, followed by orange-red berries that are a food source for birds and small mammals. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and thickets. Rhamnus elegans is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native habitats."
