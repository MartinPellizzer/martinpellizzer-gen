    "intro": "Rubus arduennensis var. albiflorus, commonly known as the whiteflower blackberry, is a variant of the arduennensis blackberry species. It is characterized by its white flowers, which contrast with the typical pink or red blooms of other Rubus species. The plant produces small, dark berries that are typically harvested in late summer. It is native to specific regions in Europe and is often found in moist, woodland habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
