It is characterized by its woody stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a smooth surface. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Rauvolfia laevigata is valued in traditional medicine for its potential medicinal properties."
