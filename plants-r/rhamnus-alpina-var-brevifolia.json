    "intro": "Rhamnus alpina var. brevifolia, commonly known as the short-leaved buckthorn, is a shrub native to alpine and subalpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its small, oval leaves that are typically less than 2 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in the spring, followed by dark blue berries that are edible for certain bird species. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is often found in mountainous regions where other plants struggle to grow."
