    "intro": "Rebutia odontopetala, commonly known as the toothed petal rebutia, is a species of cactus native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a whitish bloom. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, adding striking visual appeal. Its succulent nature allows it to store water, making it drought-tolerant. Rebutia odontopetala is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance requirements."
