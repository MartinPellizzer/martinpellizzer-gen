    "intro": "Rosa coriifolia var. decidua, commonly known as the deciduous shrub rose, is a cold-hardy species native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its arching stems and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in early spring. The leaves are pinnately compound, with slender, serrated leaflets that turn yellow in autumn. This variety is notable for its deciduous nature, shedding its foliage in winter, which distinguishes it from its evergreen relatives. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens in temperate climates."
