    "intro": "Rhamnus albida, commonly known as the white buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically glossy and dark green. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by small, black berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and rocky areas. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain regions."
