    "intro": "Rumex obtusifolius f. grandis, commonly known as the large-leaf dock, is a variant of the broadleaf dock characterized by its larger, more robust leaves. It is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia, typically found in moist soils along stream banks and in wet meadows. The plant features a stout, upright stem that can grow up to 1.5 meters tall, with broad, heart-shaped leaves that are usually smooth or slightly hairy. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in dense terminal spikes, which appear in late summer. The leaves and stems are often used in traditional herbal medicine for their astringent properties."
