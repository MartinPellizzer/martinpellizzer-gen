    "intro": "Rhodocactus lychnidiflorus, commonly known as the candleflower cactus, is a rare and unique species native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that can reach several meters in height. The plant produces striking, lantern-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. These flowers bloom during the dry season and are adapted to attract specific pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural environment."
