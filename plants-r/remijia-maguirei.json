    "intro": "Remijia maguirei, commonly known as the Maguire's mallow, is a rare flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, velvety leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is known for its hairy stems and lobed foliage. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in several states."
