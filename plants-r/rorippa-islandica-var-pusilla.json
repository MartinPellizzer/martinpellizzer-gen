It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions. The plant has small, alternate leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters and blooming in early summer. It is often found in mountainous areas and is considered a characteristic species of cold, nutrient-poor habitats."
