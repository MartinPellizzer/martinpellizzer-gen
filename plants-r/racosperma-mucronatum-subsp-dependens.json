It is characterized by its narrow, upright growth habit and small, oblong leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in dense, globular inflorescences, which are typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal and sandy environments. The subspecies is distinguished by its shorter stems and more compact form compared to other members of the species."
