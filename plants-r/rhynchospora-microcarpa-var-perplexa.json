    "intro": "Rhynchospora microcarpa var. perplexa, commonly known as the small-fruited marsh sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, typically blooming in late summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies in moist soils. This variant is distinguished by its smaller, more compact fruiting structures compared to other varieties within the species."
