    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus f. cervicornis, commonly known as the horned buttercup, is a variant of the common buttercup characterized by its distinctive, horn-like sepals. This perennial herb is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in moist meadows and woodland edges. Its flowers are typically yellow with five broadly ovate sepals that curve outward, giving it a unique appearance. The plant has a short, stout stem and produces small, bright yellow petals that bloom in early spring. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate, cup-like flowers."
