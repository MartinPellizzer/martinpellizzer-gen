    "intro": "Roegneria foliosa, commonly known as the velvet grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and distinctive, narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and wetlands. Roegneria foliosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing habitat and food for various insects and small animals."
