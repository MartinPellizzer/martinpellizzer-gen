    "intro": "Ranunculus cassubicus subsp. scalaridens, commonly known as the scalycup buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and stream banks. The plant features a basal rosette of deeply lobed, palmately compound leaves, which are usually covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are yellow with 5-7 sepals and numerous stamens, forming a showy, cup-like structure. It is an important plant in ecological studies due to its role in supporting pollinators and its sensitivity to environmental changes."
