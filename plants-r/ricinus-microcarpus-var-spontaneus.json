    "intro": "Ricinus microcarpus var. spontaneus, commonly known as the African firethorn, is a shrub native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and bright red or orange berries that attract birds. The plant produces small, palmate leaves with a hairy texture, and its flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, often growing in coastal or disturbed habitats. Due to its ornamental value and invasive potential, it is sometimes cultivated as a garden plant."
