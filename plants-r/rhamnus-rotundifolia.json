    "intro": "Rhamnus rotundifolia, commonly known as the roundleaf buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are often slightly hairy. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by dark blue berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
