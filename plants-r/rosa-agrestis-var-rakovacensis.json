    "intro": "Rosa agrestis var. rakovacensis, commonly known as the Rakovac wild rose, is a rare and endemic species native to the Balkan region. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, fragrant pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces oval, red-tinged hips that contain seeds, typical of the Rosa genus. It thrives in rocky soils and dry habitats, often found in mountainous areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
