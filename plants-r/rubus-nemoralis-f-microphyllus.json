It is a shrub characterized by its dense, thorny growth habit and small, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The flowers are typically white or pale pink, and the fruit is a small, dark purple to black berry. This plant is often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils, thriving in partial shade. Its botanical features make it a distinctive member of the Rubus genus, with unique leaf morphology compared to other brambles."
