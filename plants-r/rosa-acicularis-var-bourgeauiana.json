    "intro": "Rosa acicularis var. bourgeauiana, commonly known as the Bourgeauiana thorned rose, is a rare and ornamental shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, thorned stems and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. The leaves are typically simple, alternate, and covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. This variety is valued for its unique appearance and is often cultivated in specialized gardens. Due to its limited natural range, it is considered a rare and endangered species in the wild."
