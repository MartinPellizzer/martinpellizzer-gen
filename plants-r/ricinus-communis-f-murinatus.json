This cultivar is prized for its ornamental value, featuring dark green foliage with a soft, fuzzy texture. The plant is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Africa. It produces striking red or orange flowers that bloom in spikes, adding visual interest to gardens. However, like other Ricinus species, it contains toxic seeds that should be handled with care."
