It is a natural hybrid between Rubus ursinus (blackberry) and Rubus fruticosus (bramble), resulting in a plant with distinctive botanical features. The plant produces large, dark purple to black berries that are typically larger and sweeter than those of its parent species. Its leaves are typically trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it has thorny stems typical of the Rubus genus. The plant is valued for its fruit in both culinary and commercial applications."
