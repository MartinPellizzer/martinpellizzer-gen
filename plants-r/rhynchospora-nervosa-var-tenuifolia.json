It is a perennial herb with narrow, grass-like leaves that have distinct, parallel veins. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pale green to brown, often resembling grass or sedges. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its botanical structure and habitat preferences make it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
