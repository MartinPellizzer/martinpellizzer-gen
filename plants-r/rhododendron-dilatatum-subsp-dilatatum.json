    "intro": "Rhododendron dilatatum subsp. dilatatum, commonly known as the alpine rhododendron, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and showy, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and high-altitude environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, providing a striking contrast to its vibrant pink or red blossoms. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in its native habitat."
