    "intro": "Rumex nemorivagus, commonly known as the woodland sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive reddish or purple hue on the underside, which is a characteristic feature of the Rumex genus. Its flowers are small and clustered in spikes, producing a modest amount of seeds. The plant is known for its acidic taste due to the presence of oxalic acid in its leaves."
