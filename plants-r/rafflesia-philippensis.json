    "intro": "Rafflesia philippensis, commonly known as the Philippine rafflesia, is a parasitic flowering plant native to the rainforests of the Philippines. It is notable for producing the world's largest individual flower, which can reach up to 30 inches in diameter. The plant lacks leaves, stems, and roots, relying entirely on its host, the Tetrastigma vine, for nutrients. Its flowers emit a strong, unpleasant odor resembling decaying flesh, which attracts pollinators like flies and beetles. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Rafflesia philippensis is considered critically endangered."
