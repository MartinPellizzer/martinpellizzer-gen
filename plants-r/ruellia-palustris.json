    "intro": "Ruellia palustris, commonly known as marsh ruellia, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the wetlands of the southeastern United States. It features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy and have a bluish-green hue. The plant produces clusters of trumpet-shaped, tubular flowers that range in color from white to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Ruellia palustris thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in swamps, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Its ability to tolerate waterlogged conditions makes it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
