    "intro": "Ranunculus lusitanicus, commonly known as the Iberian buttercup, is a perennial herb native to the Iberian Peninsula. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges. The plant features a basal rosette of doubly serrated leaves and produces showy, yellow flowers with five petal-like sepals. It blooms from April to June, and its flowers are often visited by bees and other pollinators. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
