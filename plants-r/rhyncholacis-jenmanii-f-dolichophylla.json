    "intro": "Rhyncholacis jenmanii f. dolichophylla, commonly known as the long-leaf form of the genus Rhyncholacis, is a rare and specialized plant species. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its elongated, strap-like leaves. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in mountainous regions. Its flowers are small and tubular, often displaying vivid colors to attract specific pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
