    "intro": "Ricinus communis var. typicus, commonly known as the castor oil plant, is a flowering plant native to the eastern and southern regions of Africa. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves and spiny calyces surrounding its distinctive yellow-orange flowers. The plant produces toxic seeds that contain ricin, a potent toxin used in various industrial and medicinal applications. It thrives in warm, tropical climates and is often cultivated for its oil-rich seeds. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it both a valuable crop and an invasive species in some regions."
