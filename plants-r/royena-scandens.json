    "intro": "Royena scandens, commonly known as the climbing rock fig, is a woody vine native to tropical regions of Africa. It features heart-shaped leaves that are often pubescent and can grow up to 30 cm in length. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible fig-like fruits that are typically yellow or orange when mature. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and tropical landscapes."
