    "intro": "Rubus adscitus, commonly known as the common blackberry, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves. The plant produces aggregate fruits, commonly referred to as blackberries, which are edible and widely cultivated for their flavor and nutritional value. Rubus adscitus thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, loamy soils. It is often found in hedgerows, woodlands, and disturbed areas, where it plays a role in supporting local wildlife and soil stabilization."
