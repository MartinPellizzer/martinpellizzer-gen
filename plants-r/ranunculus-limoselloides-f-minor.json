    "intro": "Ranunculus limoselloides f. minor, commonly known as the lesser water crowfoot, is a low-growing perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its delicate, palmately divided leaves and showy yellow flowers. It thrives in moist, often calcareous soils and is typically found in wet meadows, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it is often associated with riparian habitats. Its flowers bloom from late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The species is relatively small in stature, with a compact growth habit that makes it well-suited to its wetland environment."
