    "intro": "Rosa viscaria var. pubescens, commonly known as the woolly rose, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, fuzzy grayish-white hairs covering the stems and leaves, which provide insulation against harsh climates. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and also covered in a fine layer of pubescence. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in cold environments."
