    "intro": "Rosa pouzinii var. micracantha, commonly known as the narrow-armed shrub rose, is a compact, deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of China. It features small, dark green leaves with a slightly hairy texture and produces clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers in late spring. The plant is characterized by its short, stiff thorns and is well adapted to rocky and arid environments. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and hardy nature. The variety is a less common cultivar within the Rosa genus, often grown for its unique form and resilience."
