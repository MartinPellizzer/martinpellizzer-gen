    "intro": "Rosa quasicoerulea, commonly known as the blue rose, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It is notable for its deep blue petals, a color rarely found in true roses due to the absence of the pigment responsible for red hues. The plant is a deciduous shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, producing a fragrant and visually appealing display. Rosa quasicoerulea is valued not only for its ornamental qualities but also for its cultural significance in traditional Chinese horticulture."
