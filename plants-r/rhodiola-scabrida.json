It belongs to the Crassulaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, succulent leaves and small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments and possesses a deep root system that allows it to survive in harsh conditions. Rhodiola scabrida is also noted for its ability to accumulate secondary metabolites, which contribute to its medicinal properties and ecological resilience."
