It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, scale-like leaves that are arranged in opposite pairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, typically blooming in the spring. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with poor soil conditions. Rhacoma decussata is often used for erosion control and as a ornamental plant in xeriscaping."
