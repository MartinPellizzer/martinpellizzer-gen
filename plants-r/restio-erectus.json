    "intro": "Restio erectus, commonly known as the upright restio, is a perennial grass-like plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Restionaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in coastal and sandy soils, often in open, sunny environments. It has a fibrous root system and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often wind-pollinated. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ornamental gardening for its architectural form and drought tolerance."
