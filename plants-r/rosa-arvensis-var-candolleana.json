    "intro": "Rosa arvensis var. candolleana, commonly known as the creeping dog\u73ab\u7470, is a perennial shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink to white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are compound, consisting of five to seven oval-shaped leaflets, and are covered in fine hairs. This variety is often found in disturbed soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
