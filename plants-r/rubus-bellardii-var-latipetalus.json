It is characterized by its large, broad petals and dark, almost black fruits that ripen in late summer. The plant typically grows as a shrub with thorny stems and compound leaves, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, and the fruit is edible, though often tart and used in jams or pies.
