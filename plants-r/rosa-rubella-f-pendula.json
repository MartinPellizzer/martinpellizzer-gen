    "intro": "Rosa rubella f. pendula, commonly known as the hanging pink rose, is a unique cultivar of the Rosa rubella species. It is characterized by its pendulous growth habit, with long, arching stems that droop gracefully from the plant. The flowers are typically pink in color, with a soft, velvety texture and a subtle fragrance. This plant thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for garden borders or containers. Its ornamental value lies in its delicate appearance and the way it cascades from its supports, adding a touch of elegance to any landscape."
