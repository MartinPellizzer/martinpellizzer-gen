    "intro": "Rubus questieri microgene rotundatus, commonly known as the round-leaf everlet bramble, is a rare species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its small, round leaves and clusters of white to pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces small, dark red berries that are typically edible but not widely cultivated. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and thickets. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
