    "intro": "Rodionenkoa tenuis, commonly known as the slender rodionenkoa, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like foliage. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is often found in rocky or semi-arid environments. Its botanical study is important for understanding the biodiversity of its native ecosystems."
