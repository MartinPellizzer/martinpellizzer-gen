    "intro": "Rumex madaio, commonly known as the Madaio sorrel, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features alternate, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly rough texture. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are edible and have a tart, sour flavor due to their high oxalic acid content. Rumex madaio is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in partial shade to full sun."
