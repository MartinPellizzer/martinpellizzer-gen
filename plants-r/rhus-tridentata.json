    "intro": "Rhus tridentata, commonly known as the sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically divided into three to five leaflets, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by bright red, spiny fruit clusters that persist into winter. Rhus tridentata is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in dry, open habitats such as prairies and woodland edges. Its botanical features make it a valuable component of native plant communities and a common sight in the eastern and central United States."
