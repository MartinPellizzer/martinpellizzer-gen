    "intro": "Rhynchosia cana, commonly known as the yellow spiderflower, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its striking yellow or orange flowers that resemble spider-like structures. The plant typically grows as an erect annual herb with compound leaves and produces small, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. Rhynchosia cana is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and open fields, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria."
