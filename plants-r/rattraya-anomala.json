    "intro": "Rattraya anomala, commonly known as the Malayan white sand orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic soils found in white sand habitats, which are unique to certain regions. The plant produces striking white to pale yellow flowers with a distinctive, intricate structure typical of the Orchidaceae family. Its growth is slow and it relies on specific symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists."
