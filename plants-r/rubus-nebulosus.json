    "intro": "Rubus nebulosus, commonly known as the clouded blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the western United States. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, white to pink flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible berries that are typically dark purple or black. It thrives in moist, wooded areas and is often found in mountainous regions. The berries are used in local cuisines and have mild flavors, though they are less commonly cultivated than other blackberry varieties."
