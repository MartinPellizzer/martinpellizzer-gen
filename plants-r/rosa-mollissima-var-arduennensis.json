    "intro": "Rosa mollissima var. arduennensis, commonly known as the Arduennais rose, is a rare and unique variant of the silky rose. It is characterized by its soft, velvety foliage and delicate pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring. Native to the mountainous regions of southern France, this plant thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens or as a decorative shrub. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
