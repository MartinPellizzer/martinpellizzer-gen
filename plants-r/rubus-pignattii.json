It belongs to the Rubus genus, which includes many brambles and raspberries. The plant produces small, red, edible fruits that are similar in appearance to those of the common raspberry. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
