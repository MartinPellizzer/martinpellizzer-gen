    "intro": "Retama sphaerocarpa, commonly known as the globe thornapple, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range from white to pink, followed by spherical, fleshy fruits. The plant has small, leathery leaves and is adapted to dry, rocky environments. It is often used in ornamental gardening due to its drought tolerance and unique appearance. However, its fruits contain toxic compounds and should not be consumed by humans or animals."
