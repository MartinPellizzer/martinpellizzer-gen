    "intro": "Rhododendron crassifolium, commonly known as the thick-leaved rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia, including China, Korea, and Japan. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and broad, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces showy clusters of bell-shaped flowers, usually in shades of pink, red, or white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers cool, moist environments with partial shade. Rhododendron crassifolium is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a component of native plant landscapes."
