    "intro": "Rosa caesia var. berniciensis, commonly known as the Bernician rose, is a rare and ancient variety of rose native to the British Isles. It is characterized by its pale pink to white flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to salty, windy conditions. Its leaves are narrow and silvery-green, with a distinctive scent. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
