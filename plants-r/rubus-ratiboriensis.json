    "intro": "Rubus ratiboriensis, commonly known as the Ratibori raspberry, is a species of bramble native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red when ripe, though they may vary in color. It thrives in moist, wooded habitats and is often found in the understory of forests. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
