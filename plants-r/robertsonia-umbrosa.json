    "intro": "Robertsonia umbrosa, commonly known as the shadowy bellflower, is a rare and unique plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from deep purple to dark blue. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in cloud forests where it clings to rocky substrates. Its leaves are typically broad and glossy, adapted to capture limited sunlight. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Robertsonia umbrosa is considered a vulnerable species."
