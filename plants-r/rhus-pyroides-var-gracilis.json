    "intro": "Rhus pyroides var. gracilis, commonly known as the slender winged sumac, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 3\u20135 pairs of leaflets, and its clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in late spring. The plant produces red, fuzzy berries that are an important food source for wildlife. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is adapted to a variety of soil types, making it a versatile addition to native plant gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and seasonal color changes."
