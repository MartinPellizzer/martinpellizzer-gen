    "intro": "Rindera lanata var. canescens, commonly known as the hairy rindera, is a species characterized by its distinctive hairy foliage. The plant features lanceolate leaves that are densely covered in white to grayish pubescence, giving it a fuzzy appearance. It produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow in color. The hairy rindera is often found in arid or semi-arid environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to drought conditions, with reduced leaf surfaces and deep root systems."
