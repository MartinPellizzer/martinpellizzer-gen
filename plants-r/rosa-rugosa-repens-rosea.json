    "intro": "Rosa rugosa repens-rosea, commonly known as the beach rose, is a hardy shrub native to coastal regions of Asia and Europe. It is characterized by its rugged, thorny stems and dense, evergreen foliage that thrives in salty, sandy soils. The plant produces fragrant, pink or white flowers in late spring to early summer, followed by orange or red hips that are both ornamental and edible. It is well adapted to coastal environments due to its salt tolerance and ability to withstand harsh weather conditions. Its vigorous growth habit makes it an effective erosion control plant along shorelines."
