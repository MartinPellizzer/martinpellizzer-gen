    "intro": "Rubus empelios, commonly known as the alpine blackberry, is a species of brambles native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant produces small, dark red to black berries that are edible, though often tart and less commonly consumed than other Rubus species. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and its stems are covered in stiff, prickly hairs. The plant plays an important ecological role in its native habitats by providing food for various wildlife species."
