It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows as a shrub, reaching heights of up to 6 feet, and prefers acidic, well-drained soils. It thrives in shaded to partially shaded environments and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
