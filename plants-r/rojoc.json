    "intro": "Rojoc, commonly known as the red-flowered orchid, is a species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, velvety red petals and a subtle yellow throat. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers bloom during the rainy season, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its ornamental value, Rojoc is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
