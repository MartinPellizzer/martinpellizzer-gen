These plants are native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including the Philippines and Indonesia. Rhaphiostylis species are characterized by their striking, star-shaped flowers that often display vibrant colors such as yellow, orange, and red. They typically grow as epiphytes or lithophytes, attaching themselves to trees or rocks in their natural habitat. The flowers are pollinated by specific insects, contributing to their ecological significance in their native ecosystems."
