    "intro": "Rhinactina uniflora, commonly known as the single-flower rhinoceros plant, is a rare and unique species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid environment. The plant produces a single, strikingly large flower that blooms only once a year, typically during the summer months. Its scientific name reflects its distinctive rhinoceros-like appearance, with a central spike resembling a horn. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
