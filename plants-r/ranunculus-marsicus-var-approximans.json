    "intro": "Ranunculus marsicus var. approximans, commonly known as the Alpine buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features delicate, bright yellow flowers with five to eight petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has a short, stout stem that is usually covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are palmately divided with a lobed structure. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and slopes. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive species in its native range."
