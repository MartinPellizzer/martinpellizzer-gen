    "intro": "Rhynchospora subcapitata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved spike-rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and rushes, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with three-ranked leaves. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of pale green to brown flowers, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, contributing to soil stabilization in aquatic environments. Rhynchospora subcapitata is often found in shallow water or saturated soils, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
