    "intro": "Rumex caucasicus, commonly known as Caucasian sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It features a basal rosette of lance-shaped, reddish-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in spring, which are borne on slender, erect stalks. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively and thrive in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The leaves and young shoots are edible, though they contain oxalic acid and should be consumed in moderation."
