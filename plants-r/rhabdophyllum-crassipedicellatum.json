It is characterized by its unique, thickened pseudobulbs and showy, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous or coastal areas. Its pollination is primarily achieved through specific insect species, highlighting its ecological niche. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts."
