    "intro": "Rhamnus spicata, commonly known as the spiny buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, wooded areas and can reach heights of up to 6 feet. The plant features small, oval leaves with a smooth surface and dark green coloration. Its flowers are yellowish-green and appear in clusters, followed by small, red berries that are edible for some wildlife. Rhamnus spicata has a woody stem with thorn-like branches, contributing to its rugged appearance."
