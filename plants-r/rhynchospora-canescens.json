It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges and other grass-like plants. The plant is characterized by its tall, cylindrical inflorescence composed of numerous spikelets, which are typically covered in fine, hairy structures. Its leaves are grass-like, narrow, and often have a bluish-gray hue due to the presence of trichomes.
