It is a perennial herb characterized by its hairy, spiny stems and leaves with a distinctive scale-like appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a compact cluster, typical of the daisy family. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. Rhaphiodon echinus is adapted to survive in dry conditions, with deep roots and a waxy leaf coating to reduce water loss."
