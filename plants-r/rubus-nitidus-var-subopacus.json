    "intro": "Rubus nitidus var. subopacus, commonly known as the dark-leaved raspberry, is a variant of the raspberry plant native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its dark green, slightly glossy leaves and small, aggregate fruits that are typically reddish or black when mature. The plant produces fragrant white flowers in the spring, which are pollinated by bees and other insects. Its thorny stems and bracts are typical of the Rubus genus, and it thrives in moist, wooded areas. This variant is less commonly cultivated than other raspberry species but is valued for its ornamental and wild edible qualities."
