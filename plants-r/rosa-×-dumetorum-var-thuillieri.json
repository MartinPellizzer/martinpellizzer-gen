    "intro": "Rosa \u00d7 dumetorum var. thuillieri, commonly known as the French rose or Rosa rugosa, is a hybrid shrub native to coastal regions of Europe and North America. It is characterized by its thorny stems, broad oval leaves, and clusters of fragrant, pink or white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is highly adaptable, thriving in sandy or saline soils and tolerating salt spray, making it common in coastal environments. It produces rose hips, which are red, fuzzy fruits containing seeds, and is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and ornamental value."
