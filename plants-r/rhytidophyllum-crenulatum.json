    "intro": "Rhytidophyllum crenulatum, commonly known as the crested rock fig, is a unique succulent native to South Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are often adorned with a waxy, whitish coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, round fruits resembling small figs. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its striking appearance and adaptability, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
