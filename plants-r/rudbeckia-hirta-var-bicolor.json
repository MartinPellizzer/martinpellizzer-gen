    "intro": "Rudbeckia hirta var. bicolor, commonly known as the black-eyed Susan, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America. It is characterized by its bright yellow to orange petals and a dark brown central disk, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet and produces showy composite flowers that bloom from late spring to early fall. Its leaves are heart-shaped, rough to the touch, and covered in fine hairs. Rudbeckia hirta var. bicolor is often found in prairies, open woods, and along roadsides, thriving in full sun and well-drained soil."
