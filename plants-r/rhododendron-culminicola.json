    "intro": "Rhododendron culminicola, commonly known as the alpine rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Asia, particularly in the Himalayas. It is a shrub that typically grows at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. The plant produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to purple, blooming in the spring. Its leaves are dark green and leathery, adapted to withstand the harsh conditions of its alpine habitat. Rhododendron culminicola plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various alpine flora and fauna."
