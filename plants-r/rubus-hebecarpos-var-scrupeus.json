    "intro": "Rubus hebecarpos var. scrupeus, commonly known as the rough-tipped blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to parts of North America. It is a shrub that typically grows in woodland edges and moist, shaded areas. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are edible but have a tart flavor. Its leaves are compound, with three to five leaflets, and the stems are often armed with prickles. The botanical features of this variety make it distinct within the Rubus genus, particularly in its foliage and fruit characteristics."
