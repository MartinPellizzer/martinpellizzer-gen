It exhibits characteristics of both parent species, with thorny stems and compound leaves. The flowers are typically pink or white, and the fruit is a aggregate of small drupelets. It is often cultivated for its edible berries, which have a flavor profile combining the sweetness of raspberries and the tartness of blackberries."
