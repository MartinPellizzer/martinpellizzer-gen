    "intro": "Rubus dasyphyllus, commonly known as the big-leaf blackberry, is a species of brambles native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its large, serrated leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces edible berries that are typically dark purple to black in color, though they are often less flavorful compared to other blackberry varieties. It thrives in moist, woodland habitats and is often found in the understory of forests. The plant has a prickly stem and is part of the Rubus genus, which includes many other species of brambles."
