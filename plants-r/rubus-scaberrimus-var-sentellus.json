    "intro": "Rubus scaberrimus var. sentellus, commonly known as the rough raspberry, is a variant of the brambles native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its thorny stems and trifoliate leaves, which are typically serrated and hairy. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are usually red or yellow when mature. It thrives in woodland edges and disturbed soils, often forming dense thickets. Its botanical features make it a hardy, invasive species in certain regions."
