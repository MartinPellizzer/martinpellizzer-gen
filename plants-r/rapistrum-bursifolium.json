    "intro": "Rapistrum bursifolium, commonly known as the burr salsify, is a flowering plant in the family Brassicaceae. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it typically grows in disturbed soils and along roadsides. The plant features erect, branching stems with alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are hairy and sometimes glandular. Its flowers are small, yellowish, and arranged in clusters, followed by distinctive, inflated, spiny fruits that resemble burrs. It is known for its edible roots, which have a slightly bitter taste and were historically used as a vegetable."
