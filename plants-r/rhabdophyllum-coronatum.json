    "intro": "Rhabdophyllum coronatum, commonly known as the crown fern, is a rare and striking member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is characterized by its unique, clustered fronds that resemble a crown, giving it its common name. The plant produces sporangia in specialized structures called sori, which are typically located on the undersides of its leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
