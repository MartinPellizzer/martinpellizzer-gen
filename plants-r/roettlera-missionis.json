    "intro": "Roettlera missionis, commonly known as the Mission Valley roettlera, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to dry, hot environments. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Roettlera missionis plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a habitat for small invertebrates."
