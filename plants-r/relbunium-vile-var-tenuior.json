    "intro": "Relbunium vile var. tenuior, commonly known as the slender leaved relbunium, is a rare and lesser-known member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, grass-like leaves that are typically slender and somewhat hairy. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in shaded, woodland environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
