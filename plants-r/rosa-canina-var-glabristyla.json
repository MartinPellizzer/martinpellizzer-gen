    "intro": "Rosa canina var. glabristyla, commonly known as the smooth-stemmed dog rose, is a variant of the dog rose species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, hairless stems and smaller, more delicate flowers compared to the typical Rosa canina. The plant produces red-orange hips, which are rich in vitamin C and used in traditional medicine. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun, often found in woodland edges and scrublands. Its ornamental value and ecological importance make it a notable species in botanical gardens and natural habitats."
