    "intro": "Raphanus rostratus, commonly known as the narrow-leafed radish, is a flowering plant in the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in racemes, which are followed by small, round pods containing several seeds. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest in both ecological and agricultural studies."
