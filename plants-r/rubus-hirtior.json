    "intro": "Rubus hirtior, commonly known as the bristly blackberry, is a species of flowering plant in the rose family, Rosaceae. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, dark berries that ripen in late summer. The plant is native to parts of Europe and Asia, where it thrives in woodland and hedgerow environments. Its leaves are typically trifoliate, with serrated edges, and its flowers are pinkish-white with five petals. The fruit, while not as widely cultivated as other blackberry species, is edible and has a tart flavor."
