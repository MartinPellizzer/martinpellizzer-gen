    "intro": "Rubus pydarensis, commonly known as the Pydare raspberry, is a species of brambles native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or black when mature. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a temperate climate with adequate sunlight. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
