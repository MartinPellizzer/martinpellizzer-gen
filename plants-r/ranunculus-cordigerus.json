    "intro": "Ranunculus cordigerus, commonly known as the heartleaf buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a basal rosette of heart-shaped leaves with a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces showy yellow flowers with five petals and numerous stamens, typical of the Ranunculaceae family. It thrives in rocky soils and alpine meadows, often growing at high elevations. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and protected areas."
