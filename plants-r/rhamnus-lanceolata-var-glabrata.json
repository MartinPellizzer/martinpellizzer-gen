    "intro": "Rhamnus lanceolata var. glabrata, commonly known as the smoothleaf buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It features slender, upright stems that are often reddish-brown and smooth to the touch. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during early spring, followed by dark blue, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds. Its leaves are lance-shaped, with smooth margins and a glossy surface, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
