    "intro": "Rosa pimpinellifolia var. inermis, commonly known as the creeping rose or thornless shrub rose, is a deciduous shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, arching stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats or low-growing bushes. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink to white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are compound, consisting of five to seven elliptical leaflets with a slightly serrated edge. This variety is noted for its lack of thorns, making it more suitable for garden use compared to other Rosa species."
