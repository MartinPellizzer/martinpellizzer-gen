    "intro": "Rotala pseudojuniperina, commonly known as the false juniper, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Rutaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered white flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant typically grows in wetland areas, such as swamps and marshes, and is adapted to moist, acidic soils. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a slight pubescence, while its fruit is a small, fleshy drupe. Rotala pseudojuniperina is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
