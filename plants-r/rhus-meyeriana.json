    "intro": "Rhus meyeriana, commonly known as Meyer's sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and have a serrated edge. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by red, fleshy fruits that are attractive to birds. Its bark is smooth and reddish-brown, and it has a shallow root system that makes it adaptable to various soil types. Meyer's sumac is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in partial shade."
