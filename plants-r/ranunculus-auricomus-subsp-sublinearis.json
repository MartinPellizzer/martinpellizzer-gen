    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus subsp. sublinearis, commonly known as the narrowleaf buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It features delicate, palmately lobed leaves and bright yellow, petal-like flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and streambanks. Its flowers have five sepals that are often mistaken for petals, and it produces a cluster of small, greenish-brown achenes as fruits. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
