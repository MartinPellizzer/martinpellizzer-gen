    "intro": "Rubus rivularis var. cinereus, commonly known as the cinereous blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and small, dark red to black berries that ripen in late summer. The plant features trifoliate leaves with serrated edges and produces white to pale pink flowers in the spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its berries are edible but often have a tart flavor, making them suitable for jams and preserves."
