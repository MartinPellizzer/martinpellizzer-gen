    "intro": "Rubus flaccidifolius, commonly known as the soft-leaf blackberry, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its thorny stems and trifoliate leaves that are often covered in fine, silvery hairs. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black in color. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and agricultural settings."
