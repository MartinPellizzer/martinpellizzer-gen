    "intro": "Rhododendron irroratum, commonly known as the silverleaf rhododendron, is a species native to the Himalayas, particularly in regions of India and Nepal. It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage that gives it its common name. The plant produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to red, typically blooming in late spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous forests at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters. The leaves are leathery and evergreen, contributing to its ornamental value in horticulture."
