    "intro": "Ribes oligacanthum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved gooseberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the Grossulariaceae family and is characterized by its small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces edible berries that are typically reddish-purple when mature, though they are often too tart for direct consumption. Its leaves are elliptical with finely serrated edges, and the stems are covered in short, stiff hairs. Ribes oligacanthum is often found in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in cooler, shaded environments."
