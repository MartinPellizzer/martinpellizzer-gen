    "intro": "Rubus gymnostachys, commonly known as the alpine blackberry, is a species of brambles native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its erect or decumbent growth habit and produces small, dark berries that are typically edible. The plant has serrated leaves and produces white to pale pink flowers during the summer months. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its hardy nature, it plays an important role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
