    "intro": "Rumex \u00d7 brassaianus, commonly known as the hybrid sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant resulting from the cross between Rumex acetosa (common sorrel) and Rumex acetobursa (broad-leaved sorrel). It features heart-shaped, reddish-veined leaves that are slightly hairy and have a tangy, sour taste due to its high oxalic acid content. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. It is often found in moist, fertile soils in woodland edges and disturbed areas. Its botanical characteristics make it a distinctive and sometimes invasive species in certain regions."
