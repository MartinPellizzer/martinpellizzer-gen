It is characterized by its upright growth habit, narrow leaves, and fragrant pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, oval-shaped rose hips that are typically red or orange in color. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable choice for gardens and wildflower meadows. This variety is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
