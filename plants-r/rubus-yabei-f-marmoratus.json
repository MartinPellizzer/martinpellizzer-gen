    "intro": "Rubus yabei f. marmoratus, commonly known as the marbled raspberry, is a variant of the yabei raspberry, characterized by its distinctive mottled or marbled leaf patterns. It is a deciduous shrub native to Japan, typically growing in shaded, moist environments. The plant produces small, edible red berries that are similar in taste to regular raspberries but with a slightly more tart flavor. Its ornamental value comes from its unique foliage, which features a mix of green, white, and pink hues. This cultivar is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal and mild fruit flavor."
