    "intro": "Rosa rugosa, commonly known as the rough rose, is a hardy shrub native to coastal regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its rugged, thorny stems and dark green, serrated leaves. The plant produces fragrant, pink or white flowers in the summer, followed by orange-red hips that are rich in vitamin C. Rosa rugosa is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for coastal gardens. Its dense growth habit also makes it an effective hedge or barrier plant."
