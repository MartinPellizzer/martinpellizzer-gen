    "intro": "Rigiolepis uroglossa, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a small evergreen shrub native to the western coast of India. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, which are followed by small, round fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a warm, humid climate. Due to its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
