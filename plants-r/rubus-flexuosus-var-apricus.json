    "intro": "Rubus flexuosus var. apricus, commonly known as the yellow raspberry, is a shrub-like plant native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its trailing or climbing growth habit, with slender, hairy stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, yellowish to orange-red flowers, which are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruits are aggregate berries, usually yellow or orange, and are edible when ripe. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its unique fruit color."
