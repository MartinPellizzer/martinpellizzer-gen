    "intro": "Rubus vulgarius, commonly known as common blackberry, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe, Asia, and North America. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves. The plant produces aggregate fruits, known as drupes, which are typically dark purple to black in color. These berries are edible, though they have a tart flavor and are often used in jams and pies. Rubus vulgarius thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed areas."
