It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its thorny stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or black when mature. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species."
