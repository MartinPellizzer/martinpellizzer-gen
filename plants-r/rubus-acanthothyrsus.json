    "intro": "Rubus acanthothyrsus, commonly known as the thorny raspberry. It is a species of bramble native to parts of Asia, particularly China, where it grows in temperate forest environments. The plant is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, and it produces small, edible berries similar to other raspberry species. However, due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and less commonly cultivated plant."
