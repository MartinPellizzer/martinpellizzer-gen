    "intro": "Rosa apostigma, commonly known as the ghost rose, is a rare and elusive species native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its pale pink to almost white flowers, which are often obscured by a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant has slender, wiry stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. Its flowers typically bloom in late summer and are known for their delicate, almost translucent appearance. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, Rosa apostigma is considered a botanical curiosity and is often sought after by plant enthusiasts and researchers."
