    "intro": "Rhododendron dilatatum var. glaucum, commonly known as the Glaucous Rhododendron, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern Himalayas. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and hairy, bluish-green foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to red, typically blooming in late spring. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to form thickets, providing habitat for various wildlife species."
