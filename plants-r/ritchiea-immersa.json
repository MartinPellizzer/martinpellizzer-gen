    "intro": "Ritchiea immersa, commonly known as the submerged cycad, is a unique member of the Cycadaceae family. It is native to the tropical rainforests of Queensland, Australia, and is characterized by its distinctive, submerged growth habit. The plant's leaves are typically short and broad, adapted to thrive in waterlogged environments. Its reproductive structures, including cones, are well-developed and play a crucial role in its reproductive cycle. Despite its resilience, Ritchiea immersa is considered a rare and endangered species due to habitat loss and environmental changes."
