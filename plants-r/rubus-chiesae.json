    "intro": "Rubus chiesae, commonly known as the Chiesa bramble, is a species of flowering plant in the rose family, Rosaceae. It is native to southern Europe, particularly Italy, and thrives in rocky and calcareous soils. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in summer, followed by edible, red berries. Its leaves are typically trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the plant has a shrub-like growth habit. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
