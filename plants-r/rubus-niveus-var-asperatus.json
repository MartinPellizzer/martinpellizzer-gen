    "intro": "Rubus niveus var. asperatus, commonly known as the rough evergreen raspberry, is a variant of the evergreen raspberry plant native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and dark green, leathery leaves that remain throughout the winter. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers in the spring, which are followed by edible, red berries in the summer. It thrives in woodland areas and prefers moist, well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
