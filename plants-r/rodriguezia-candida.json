    "intro": "Rodriguezia candida, commonly known as the white rodriguezia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, showy white or pale pink bracts that resemble petals, which are actually modified leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, adding to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of rainforests. Rodriguezia candida is valued for its unique appearance and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
