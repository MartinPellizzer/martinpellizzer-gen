    "intro": "Rosa villosa subsp. molliovatidens, commonly known as the woolly rose, is a shrub native to the high altitudes of South America, particularly in regions of Argentina and Chile. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and stems, which provide a distinctive textured appearance. The plant produces fragrant, pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine, white hairs, contributing to its overall woolly appearance. Rosa villosa subsp. molliovatidens is often cultivated for its ornamental value and hardy nature in cooler climates."
