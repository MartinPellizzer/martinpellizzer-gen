    "intro": "Rumex densiflorus subsp. orthoneurus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved dock, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, serrated leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces dense clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in wet meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges. Its leaves and stems are sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine for their astringent properties."
