    "intro": "Rosa pruinosa, commonly known as the silvery rose, is a species of flowering plant in the rose family. It is characterized by its pale pink to white flowers and a distinctive silvery-blue waxy coating on its leaves and stems. Native to regions of Asia, including China and Japan, this plant thrives in temperate climates. The silvery bloom is due to a layer of fine, reflective hairs that cover the plant's surface. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
