It produces small, yellow flowers that are followed by pods containing edible seeds. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and trifoliate leaves, which are typical of the Fabaceae family. It is often found in moist, shaded areas and is used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. The seeds are also used as a protein source in some parts of its native range."
