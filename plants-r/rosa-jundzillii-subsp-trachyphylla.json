    "intro": "Rosa jundzillii subsp. trachyphylla, commonly known as the roughleaf rock rose, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its woody stems and dense foliage, with leaves that are typically covered in a rough, glandular texture. The plant produces fragrant, pink to reddish-pink flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is a sought-after plant among gardeners in colder climates."
