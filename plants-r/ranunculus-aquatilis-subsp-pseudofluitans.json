    "intro": "Ranunculus aquatilis subsp. pseudofluitans, commonly known as the floating buttercup, is a aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds, ditches, and wet meadows. The plant features small, yellow flowers with five petals and is characterized by its floating or submerged growth habit. Its leaves are usually divided into lobes and can be either floating on the water surface or submerged beneath it. This subspecies is often found in disturbed aquatic habitats and can be an indicator of nutrient-rich waters."
