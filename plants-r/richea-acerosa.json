    "intro": "Richea acerosa, commonly known as the hard-leaved richea, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub characterized by its woody stems and narrow, leathery leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on short pedicels. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to withstand periods of drought. Richea acerosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
