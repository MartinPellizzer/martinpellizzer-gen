    "intro": "Rosa glauca var. genuina, commonly known as the alpine pink, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces clusters of pale pink to white flowers. The plant has dark green, elliptical leaves with a slightly hairy surface. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in cooler climates."
