    "intro": "Ribes aciculare, commonly known as the prickly gooseberry, is a deciduous shrub native to North America. It is characterized by its spiny stems and small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible but often tart. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks. Ribes aciculare is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing food for birds and other wildlife."
