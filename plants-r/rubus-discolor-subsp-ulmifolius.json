    "intro": "Rubus discolor subsp. ulmifolius, commonly known as the silverleaf blackberry, is a shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its distinctive silvery-white undersides on its leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, dark red berries that are typically edible but often have a tart flavor. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and thickets. Its botanical features make it a notable species in ecological studies and horticultural cultivation."
