    "intro": "Rhamnus ferrea, commonly known as ironwood or blackthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, thorny branches and small, dark green leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by black, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds and some mammals. Rhamnus ferrea is known for its hard, dense wood, which is highly resistant to decay and has been historically used for tool handles and other durable items. Its botanical features make it an important plant in both ecological and historical contexts."
