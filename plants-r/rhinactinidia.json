    "intro": "Rhinactinidia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant's botanical features include long, thin roots and a single, waxy, white flower that blooms in late summer. It has no leaves, relying instead on its roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, Rhinactinidia is considered endangered and is protected in many areas."
