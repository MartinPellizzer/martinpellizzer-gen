    "intro": "Roessleria gorterioides subsp. gorterioides, commonly known as the Gorteri's roessleria, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit. The plant produces striking, tubular inflorescences that are typically red or orange in color, attracting specific pollinators. Its leaves are narrow, fleshy, and often covered in a waxy coating to help retain moisture. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
