    "intro": "Ranunculus flammula var. radicans, commonly known as the creeping buttercup, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features delicate, yellow flowers with five petals and a hairy stem that often lies close to the ground. The plant has trifoliate leaves, with each leaflet being heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and streambanks. Its rapid spreading habit makes it both a common weed and a notable component of wetland ecosystems."
