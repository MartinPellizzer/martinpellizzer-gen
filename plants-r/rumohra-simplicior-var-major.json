    "intro": "Rumohra simplicior var. major, commonly known as the giant reed or giant grass, is a tall, perennial grass native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and long, narrow leaves that can reach heights of up to 6 meters. The plant produces dense, fluffy seed heads that are often used in floral arrangements. It thrives in wetland environments and is often found near water bodies such as rivers and lakes. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense stands make it both a useful ornamental plant and a potential invasive species in some regions."
