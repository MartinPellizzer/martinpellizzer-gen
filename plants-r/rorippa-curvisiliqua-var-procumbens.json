    "intro": "Rorippa curvisiliqua var. procumbens, commonly known as the prostrate watercress, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and elongated, succulent leaves. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense mats near the edges of ponds and streams. Its leaves are edible and have a peppery flavor, similar to that of other watercress species. This variant is distinguished by its prostrate growth habit, which allows it to spread across the surface of aquatic habitats."
