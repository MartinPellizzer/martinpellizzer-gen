    "intro": "Russelia verticillata, commonly known as the whirling vine, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and clusters of tubular, coral-red to orange flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. The plant produces small, oval-shaped leaves that are arranged in whorls around the stems, giving it its common name. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for hanging baskets and containers. Russelia verticillata is also valued for its ability to attract hummingbirds and other pollinators."
