It features compound leaves with large, serrated leaflets that are typically dark green on top and slightly hairy underneath. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers in clusters, which are followed by edible, red berries that are often used in jams and preserves. It thrives in temperate climates and is commonly found in woodland edges and disturbed soils. Its botanical features make it a notable species in both horticulture and ecological studies."
