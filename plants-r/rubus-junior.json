It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and small, aggregate fruits that are typically red when ripe. The plant produces trifoliate leaves with serrated edges and has thorny stems that provide structural support. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks. The flowers are white or pale pink, with five petals and numerous stamens, contributing to its ornamental value."
