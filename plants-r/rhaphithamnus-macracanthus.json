    "intro": "Rhaphithamnus macracanthus, commonly known as the coastal saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, scale-like leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its roots are extensive and capable of accessing deep water sources, making it highly drought-tolerant. Rhaphithamnus macracanthus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal and inland soils and providing habitat for native wildlife."
