It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves that are typically dark green with a reddish or purple tint on the underside. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, edible berries in the summer. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers moist, well-drained conditions. This species is often found in hedgerows, woodland edges, and disturbed areas."
