    "intro": "Rosa canina var. gracilis, commonly known as the slender dog rose, is a compact shrub native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring thorny stems and dark green, lobed leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers in late spring, which give way to red, hairy fruits known as hips. Its foliage is often covered in a fine, white down, giving it a distinctive appearance. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its historical and medicinal significance."
