    "intro": "Rubus rivularis var. aglabratus, commonly known as the smooth-stemmed blackberry, is a perennial shrub native to parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its slender, often hairless stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and stream banks. Its botanical features make it distinct from other Rubus species, particularly in its smooth stem texture and fruit morphology."
