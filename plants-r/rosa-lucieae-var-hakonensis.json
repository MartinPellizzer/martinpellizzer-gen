    "intro": "Rosa lucieae var. hakonensis, commonly known as Hakonensis rose, is a rare and distinctive shrub native to the mountainous regions of Japan. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, fragrant pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant features narrow, dark green leaves with a slightly serrated edge, and its stems are covered in dense, white to grayish hairs. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens or woodland settings. Due to its limited distribution and ornamental value, it is often cultivated by enthusiasts interested in rare flora."
