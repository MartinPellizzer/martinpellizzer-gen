    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 rudinus, commonly known as the blackberry raspberry, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Rubus ursinus (the raspberry) and Rubus chamaemorus (the cloudberry). It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows in wet, boggy environments, often found in the northern hemisphere. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or yellow, with a tart flavor. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it has a woody stem covered in thorny projections. The botanical characteristics of Rubus \u00d7 rudinus make it an important species in both ecological and horticultural contexts."
