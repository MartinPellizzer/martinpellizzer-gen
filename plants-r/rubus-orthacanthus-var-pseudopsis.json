    "intro": "Rubus orthacanthus var. pseudopsis, commonly known as the red-berried blackberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It produces small, dark red berries that are typically harvested in late summer. The plant has thorny stems and trifoliate leaves, typical of many Rubus species. Its flowers are white with five petals and are pollinated by insects. The berries are edible, though they have a tart flavor and are often used in jams and preserves."
