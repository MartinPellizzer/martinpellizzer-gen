    "intro": "Rhododendron crassinervium, commonly known as the broad-veined rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia, particularly China. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of pink to red. The plant typically grows in shady, moist environments, often in forest understories where it thrives in partial to full shade. Its leaves are broad and leathery, with prominent veins that give it its common name. Rhododendron crassinervium is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to a variety of garden conditions."
