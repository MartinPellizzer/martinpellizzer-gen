    "intro": "Rheum franzenbachii, commonly known as the Franzenbach's rhubarb, is a herbaceous plant native to the high altitudes of the Eastern Himalayas. It belongs to the Polygonaceae family, which includes other rhubarbs and buckwheats. The plant features large, broad leaves that are often tinged with red or purple, and it produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers in the summer. Rheum franzenbachii is characterized by its rhizomatous root system, which is similar to other rhubarb species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered plant."
