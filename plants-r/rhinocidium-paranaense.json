    "intro": "Rhinocidium paranaense, commonly known as the Paranaense rhinocidium, is a flowering plant native to the rainforests of Brazil. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in the dense canopy of the rainforest. Its leaves are broad and leathery, adapted to thrive in high humidity and low light conditions. Rhinocidium paranaense is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological diversity of its native habitat."
