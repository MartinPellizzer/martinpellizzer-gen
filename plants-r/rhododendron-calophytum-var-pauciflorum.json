    "intro": "Rhododendron calophytum var. pauciflorum, commonly known as the few-flowered calophyte, is a rare and specialized evergreen shrub native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and showy, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained acidic soils, often found in forested areas at elevations between 2,000 and 4,000 meters. Its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to its rarity and ecological significance, it is classified as endangered in some regions."
