    "intro": "Rubus edeesii, commonly known as the Edes' raspberry, is a species of bramble native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its trailing or shrub-like growth habit and produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or yellow in color. The plant has compound leaves with serrated edges and produces white to pink flowers during the spring season. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
