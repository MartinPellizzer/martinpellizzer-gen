    "intro": "Rebutia fiebrigii var. densiseta, commonly known as the Dense-hairy Rebutia, is a compact, low-growing cactus native to South America. It features dense, short, white to pale yellow hairs covering its stems, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. Its stems are cylindrical and often slightly ribbed, with a smooth texture. It is well-suited for rock gardens and requires minimal water, making it an ideal choice for xeriscaping."
