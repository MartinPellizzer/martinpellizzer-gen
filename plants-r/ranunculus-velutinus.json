    "intro": "Ranunculus velutinus, commonly known as the velvet buttercup, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, velvety stems and leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces showy yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain environments."
