    "intro": "Rhaponticum imatongense, commonly known as the Imatong grass, is a perennial herb native to the highlands of South Sudan. It is characterized by its robust, tufted growth habit and can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces yellow flowers in dense, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grassland and woodland habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in traditional medicine and as a forage plant for livestock."
