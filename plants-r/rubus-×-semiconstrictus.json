    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 semiconstrictus, commonly known as the blackberry raspberry, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Rubus ursinus (the blackberry) and Rubus idaeus (the red raspberry). It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that transition from red to black as they mature. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its edible berries. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for both ornamental and agricultural purposes."
