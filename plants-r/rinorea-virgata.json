    "intro": "Rinorea virgata, commonly known as the velvetleaf or white-flowered rinorea, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows up to 3 meters in height, characterized by its opposite, simple, and often hairy leaves. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers with five petals, which are borne on short pedicels. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Rinorea virgata is often found in the understory of tropical forests and is valued for its ornamental appeal."
