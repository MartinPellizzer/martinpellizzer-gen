It is a non-vascular plant characterized by its small, flattened, and often lobed thallus. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its structure consists of a stem-like axis with leaf-like structures called phyllidia. Richaeia leptoclada plays an important ecological role in nutrient cycling and soil stabilization in its habitat."
