    "intro": "Rottboellia ophiuroides var. intermedia, commonly known as red grass or red oat grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and distinctive red-colored inflorescences that appear in summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in full sun to partial shade. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense mats make it both a useful forage plant and a potential weed in agricultural settings."
