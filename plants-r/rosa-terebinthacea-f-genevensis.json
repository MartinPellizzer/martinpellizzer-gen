    "intro": "Rosa terebinthacea f. genevensis, commonly known as the Geneva rose, is a compact, shrub-like plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features small, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white, typically in late spring to early summer. The plant has dark green, serrated leaves and produces small, red hips that persist through the winter. It is well-suited for rock gardens and borders due to its hardiness and ornamental value. The foliage and flowers contribute to its popularity in horticultural settings."
