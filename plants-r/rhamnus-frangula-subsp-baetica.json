    "intro": "Rhamnus frangula subsp. baetica, commonly known as the Iberian buckthorn, is a shrub native to the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its small, dark green leaves and black, ribbed berries. The plant produces copious amounts of seed, which are dispersed by birds, contributing to its ecological role in the region. It thrives in dry, calcareous soils and is often found in Mediterranean scrublands. The bark and leaves have been historically used in traditional medicine for their astringent properties."
