    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus subsp. clavulifer, commonly known as the yellow pond lily, is a perennial aquatic plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features striking yellow flowers with deeply lobed petals that resemble a crown, typically blooming in late summer. The plant has broad, floating leaves that are often covered in a waxy layer to reduce water loss. Its rhizomes allow it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
