    "intro": "Rhododendron chamaetortum, commonly known as the alpine azalea, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist, and well-drained soils. The plant produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, and white during the spring. Its leaves are dark green, leathery, and arranged in whorls around the stems. Rhododendron chamaetortum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural alpine habitat."
