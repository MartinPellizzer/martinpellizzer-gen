    "intro": "Rhynchospora umbraticola, commonly known as the shadow marsh sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and swampy habitats in the southeastern United States. It typically grows in dense stands, often in shaded, poorly drained soils, and is adapted to low-light conditions. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pale green to reddish in color. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wetland organisms. Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator of undisturbed wetland ecosystems."
