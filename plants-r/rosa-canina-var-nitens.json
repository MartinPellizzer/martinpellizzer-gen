The plant produces pale pink to white flowers that are typically smaller than those of the typical Rosa canina. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with five to seven leaflets, and the fruit is a red, hairy rosehip. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in herbal medicine."
