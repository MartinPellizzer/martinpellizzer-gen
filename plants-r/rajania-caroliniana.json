    "intro": "Rajania caroliniana, commonly known as the Carolina lily, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a yellow throat. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, with narrow, grass-like leaves. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a native wildflower that supports local pollinators and contributes to wetland ecosystems."
