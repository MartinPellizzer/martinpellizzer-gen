    "intro": "Rubus rhombifer, commonly known as the rhomboid bramble, is a deciduous shrub belonging to the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its prickly stems and compound leaves with a distinctive rhomboid shape. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits called drupes, which are typically red or black in color. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodlands and hedgerows. Due to its thorny nature, it plays a role in preventing soil erosion and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
