It is characterized by its massive, pinnate leaves that can reach lengths of up to 10 meters, making it one of the tallest palms in the world. The plant has a slender trunk that is often covered in a fibrous sheath, and it produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters at the top of the plant. Its leaves are used for thatching and roofing in local communities, and the plant plays an important role in the ecosystem by providing habitat and food for various animals."
