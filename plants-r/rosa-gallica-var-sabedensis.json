    "intro": "Rosa gallica var. sabedensis, commonly known as the Sabedens rose, is a rare and ancient variety of the Gallica rose. It is characterized by its deep red to purple flowers and fragrant scent, which are typical features of the Rosa gallica species. This variety is native to the Balkans and is often found in mountainous regions with well-drained soils. Its foliage consists of dark green, serrated leaves, and it produces thorny stems typical of many rose species. Due to its historical significance and limited distribution, it is considered a valuable plant in botanical collections and conservation efforts."
