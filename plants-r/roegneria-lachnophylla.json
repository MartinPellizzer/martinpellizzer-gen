    "intro": "Roegneria lachnophylla, commonly known as the woolly false brome, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and its distinctive silver-white to grayish-blue foliage, which is covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, two-lobed flowers. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland ecosystems. Roegneria lachnophylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in arid environments."
