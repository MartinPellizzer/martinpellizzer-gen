    "intro": "Rubus kinashii, commonly known as the Japanese raspberry, is a species of bramble native to Japan. It is characterized by its prickly stems and clusters of small, red berries that ripen in late summer. The plant typically grows in forested areas and is adapted to moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and its flowers are white with five petals. The berries are edible but have a tart flavor, making them a subject of both culinary and botanical interest."
