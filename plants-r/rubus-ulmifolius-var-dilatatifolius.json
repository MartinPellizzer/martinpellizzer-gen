    "intro": "Rubus ulmifolius var. dilatatifolius, commonly known as the broad-leaved blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its large, lobed leaves that are broader than those of the typical Rubus ulmifolius. The plant produces dark purple to black berries that are often used in jams and wines. Its shrub-like growth habit makes it a common ornamental and edible plant in temperate climates. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth."
