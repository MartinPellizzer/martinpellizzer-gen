    "intro": "Restrepia metae, commonly known as the Ecuadorian bromeliad, is a species of epiphytic plant native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect water. The plant produces striking inflorescences with brightly colored flowers, typically in shades of red, orange, or yellow. Its leaves are thick and leathery, adapted to retain moisture in its humid, high-altitude habitat. Restrepia metae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by plant enthusiasts."
