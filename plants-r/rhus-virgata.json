    "intro": "Rhus virgata, commonly known as the smooth sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically pinnately arranged with 11 to 31 leaflets. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by red, fuzzy fruits that attract birds and other wildlife. Rhus virgata thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in moist to dry soils in woodland areas. Its ecological importance includes providing food and habitat for various animals and insects."
