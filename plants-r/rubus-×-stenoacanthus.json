    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 stenoacanthus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf bramble, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Rubus ursinus and Rubus parvifolius. It is characterized by its thorny stems and small, elliptical leaves with a slightly serrated edge. The plant produces aggregate fruits composed of tiny, red drupes that are typically harvested in late summer. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is cultivated in some regions for both horticultural and culinary purposes."
