    "intro": "Ranunculus chondrodes, commonly known as the alpine buttercup, is a flowering plant belonging to the Ranunculaceae family. It is characterized by its showy, yellow or orange flowers with prominent yellow stamens and a deeply lobed pistil. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine regions, preferring rocky soils and high elevations. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. Ranunculus chondrodes is often found in mountainous areas of Europe and Asia, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions."
