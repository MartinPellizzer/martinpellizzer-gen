    "intro": "Ribeirea calva, commonly known as the Brazilian cherry or *Cara\u00edba*, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and small, elliptical leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the branches. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by bright red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for various wildlife species. Ribeirea calva is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its medicinal properties."
