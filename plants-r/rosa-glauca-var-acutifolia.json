    "intro": "Rosa glauca var. acutifolia, commonly known as the blue rose or bluebush rose, is a shrub-like plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, sprawling growth habit and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that range in color from pale blue to white, with a distinctive bluish hue. Its leaves are typically grayish-green and have a leathery texture, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and full sun."
