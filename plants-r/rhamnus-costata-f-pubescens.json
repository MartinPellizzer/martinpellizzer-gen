    "intro": "Rhamnus costata f. pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent buckthorn, is a shrub native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a distinctive serrated margin. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during late spring, followed by dark blue-black berries in the fall. Its pubescent (hairy) foliage is a key distinguishing feature of this form. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas."
