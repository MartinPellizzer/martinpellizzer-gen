    "intro": "Robinia latifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf false acacia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and have a narrow, lance-shaped appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in racemes during the spring, followed by flat, pod-like fruits that contain seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woods or along streambanks. Its rapid growth and hardy nature make it a common ornamental and ecological plant in its native range."
