    "intro": "Rhus macrocarpa, commonly known as the smooth sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and turn bright red in the fall. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by red, fuzzy berries that are a food source for birds and small mammals. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is adaptable to various soil types. Rhus macrocarpa is also noted for its ability to tolerate urban environments and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value."
