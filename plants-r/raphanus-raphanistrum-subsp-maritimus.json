    "intro": "Raphanus raphanistrum subsp. maritimus, commonly known as sea radish, is a halophytic plant adapted to coastal environments. It thrives in saline soils and is often found along shorelines and in salt marshes. The plant has a robust root system that helps it anchor in loose, sandy substrates. Its leaves are fleshy and succulent, which aids in water retention in arid conditions. The flowers are small and yellow, typically appearing in clusters, and the plant is an important component of coastal ecosystems."
