    "intro": "Rubus stroblii, commonly known as the Stroblii blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and produces small, dark purple berries that are typically harvested in late summer. The plant has trifoliate leaves with serrated edges and thorny stems typical of the Rubus genus. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. The berries are edible but have a tart flavor, making them suitable for jams and preserves."
