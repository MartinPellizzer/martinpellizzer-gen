    "intro": "Rhynchelythrum stolzii, commonly known as the Stolz's rhynchelythrum, is a rare and lesser-known plant species belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in the summer months. The plant is native to specific regions in southern Africa, where it thrives in rocky or sandy soils. Its leaves are finely divided and aromatic, similar to other members of the carrot family. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
