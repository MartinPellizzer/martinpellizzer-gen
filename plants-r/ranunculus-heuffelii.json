    "intro": "Ranunculus heuffelii, commonly known as the Heuffel's buttercup, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, palmate leaves and showy, yellow flowers with five petals. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky habitats, preferring well-drained soils. It is a perennial species that blooms in late spring to early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
