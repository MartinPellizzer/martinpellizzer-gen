    "intro": "Rosa lapidosa, commonly known as the stone rose, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact, rounded growth habit and dense clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant produces small, round, stone-like fruits called achenes, which are typically reddish-brown in color. Rosa lapidosa is well adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal and arid environments. Its hardy nature and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
