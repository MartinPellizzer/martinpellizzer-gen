    "intro": "Rosa pendulina var. burdigalensis, commonly known as the Burdigalensis climbing rose, is a hybrid rose species characterized by its vigorous growth and long, arching stems. It produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink to red, which bloom repeatedly throughout the growing season. The plant is native to France and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a climbing plant. It prefers full sun and well-drained soil, and it is relatively hardy, though it may require protection in colder climates. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for trellises and vertical garden spaces."
