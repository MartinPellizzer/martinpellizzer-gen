    "intro": "Rumex patientia var. crispus, commonly known as the curly dock, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its deeply lobed, wavy-edged leaves that give it a distinctive, almost fern-like appearance. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by reddish-brown, three-lobed seed capsules. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides, in wetlands, and in agricultural fields. The leaves and stems are sometimes used in traditional herbal remedies, though the plant is generally considered a weed."
