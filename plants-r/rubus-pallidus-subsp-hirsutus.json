    "intro": "Rubus pallidus subsp. hirsutus, commonly known as the hairy evergreen bramble, is a shrub native to parts of eastern North America. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers in the spring, followed by red berries in the fall. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodlands and thickets. Due to its hirsute (hairy) appearance, it is easily distinguishable from other Rubus species."
