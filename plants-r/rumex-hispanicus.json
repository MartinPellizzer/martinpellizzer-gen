    "intro": "Rumex hispanicus, commonly known as Spanish sorrel, is a perennial herb native to the Iberian Peninsula. It features heart-shaped, reddish-green leaves with a distinctive sour taste due to its high oxalic acid content. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and along streambanks. Its botanical characteristics make it a notable species in both ecological and historical contexts."
