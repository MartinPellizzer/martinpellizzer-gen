    "intro": "Rottboellia complanata, commonly known as flatleaf grass or Indian ricegrass, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is a perennial grass that typically grows in open areas, disturbed soils, and along roadsides. The plant has narrow, flat leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny florets. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings. Rottboellia complanata is adapted to a wide range of environmental conditions, making it a resilient and widespread species."
