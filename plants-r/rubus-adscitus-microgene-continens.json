    "intro": "Rubus adscitus microgene continens, commonly known as the creeping raspberry, is a species of brambles native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and small, usually red or yellow fruits. The plant produces compound leaves with serrated edges and has thorny stems that help it climb or spread along the ground. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, and it blooms in late spring to early summer. This plant is often found in woodlands, hedgerows, and disturbed areas, where it thrives in partial shade to full sun."
