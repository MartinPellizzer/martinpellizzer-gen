It features slender, spreading stems that often lie close to the ground, forming a dense mat. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink to white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three ovate to lanceolate leaflets, and the plant is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping for its ground-covering habit."
