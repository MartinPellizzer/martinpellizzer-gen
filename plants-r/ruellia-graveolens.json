    "intro": "Ruellia graveolens, commonly known as the stinkcup, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shady environments. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of small, pale blue or purple flowers. Its flowers emit a strong, unpleasant odor, which attracts flies rather than bees. Ruellia graveolens is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and disturbed soils."
