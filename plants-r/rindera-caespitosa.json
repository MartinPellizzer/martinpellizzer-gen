    "intro": "Rindera caespitosa, commonly known as the tufted rindera, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikes, often blooming in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a slight bluish-green hue, and the plant forms compact, tufted clumps. Rindera caespitosa is adapted to arid environments and is often found in open meadows and along mountain slopes."
