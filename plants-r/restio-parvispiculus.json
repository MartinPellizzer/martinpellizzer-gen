    "intro": "Restio parvispiculus, commonly known as the small-spiked restio, is a member of the Restionaceae family, native to southern Africa. It is a perennial herb characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance and tufted growth habit. The plant features narrow, linear leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, white to pale blue flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or wetland environments. Due to its delicate structure and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
