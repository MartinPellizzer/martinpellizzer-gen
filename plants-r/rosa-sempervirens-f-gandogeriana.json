    "intro": "Rosa sempervirens f. gandogeriana, commonly known as the Gandogerian rose, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the Canary Islands. It features dark green, leathery leaves that remain on the plant year-round, contributing to its dense, bushy appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, typically blooming in spring and summer. It is well-suited for coastal gardens due to its tolerance of salt and wind. Its ornamental value lies in its evergreen foliage and delicate, long-lasting blooms."
