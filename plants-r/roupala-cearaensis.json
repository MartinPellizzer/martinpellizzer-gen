    "intro": "Roupala cearaensis, commonly known as the Cear\u00e1 roupala, is a shrub or small tree native to the Brazilian state of Cear\u00e1. It belongs to the family Proteaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often leathery in texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in dry forests and coastal areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
