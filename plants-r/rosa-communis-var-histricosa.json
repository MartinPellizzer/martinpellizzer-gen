    "intro": "Rosa communis var. histricosa, commonly known as the bristly rose, is a variant of the common rose characterized by its dense, thorny stems and foliage. It is native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia, where it thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight. The plant produces fragrant, pink to white flowers in late spring to early summer, followed by red-orange hips that persist into winter. Its robust growth habit makes it suitable for hedges or as a decorative shrub in gardens. The bristly rose is also valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal medicine."
