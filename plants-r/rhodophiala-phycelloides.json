    "intro": "Rhodophiala phycelloides, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a rosette of silver-blue leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its saline environment. Its flowers are arranged in a single terminal spike, and it produces small, round seeds enclosed in a papery capsule. Rhodophiala phycelloides is adapted to sandy soils and can tolerate salt spray, making it a hardy coastal plant."
