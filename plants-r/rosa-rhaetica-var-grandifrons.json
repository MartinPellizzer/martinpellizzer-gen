    "intro": "Rosa rhaetica var. grandifrons, commonly known as the Rhaetian rose, is a rare and striking species native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 10 centimeters in diameter, typically displaying a mix of red and pink hues. The plant has sturdy, arching stems and dark green, serrated leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white down. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions and full sun exposure. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
