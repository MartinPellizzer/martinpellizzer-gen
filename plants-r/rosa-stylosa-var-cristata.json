    "intro": "Rosa stylosa var. cristata, commonly known as the crested dog rose, is a hybrid rose species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, slightly flattened or crest-like growth pattern on its stems, which gives it its common name. The plant produces fragrant, pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are compound, consisting of five to seven oval-shaped leaflets with serrated edges. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is well-suited to temperate climates."
