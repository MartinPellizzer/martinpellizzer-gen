    "intro": "Rosa vestita, commonly known as the \"cloaked rose,\" is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly the Pamir and Tien Shan ranges. The plant is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage and clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. Rosa vestita is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters. Its botanical features make it a notable ornamental plant, though it is less commonly cultivated than other rose species."
