    "intro": "Rubus lucentifolius, commonly known as the shining-leaf bramble, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is native to certain regions of Europe and is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with a glossy appearance. The plant produces small, white to pink flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its fruits, known as berries, are typically red or black and are edible, though often tart. Rubus lucentifolius thrives in woodland edges and moist soils, and it plays a role in supporting local wildlife."
