It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically three to five leaflets, and its clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers. The plant produces edible berries that are generally smaller and less tart compared to other Rubus species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or disturbed habitats. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is cultivated in some regions for both horticultural and culinary purposes."
