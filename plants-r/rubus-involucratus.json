    "intro": "Rubus involucratus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved blackberry, is a species of flowering plant in the\u8537\u8587\u79d1 (Rosaceae) family. It is native to western North America, particularly found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. The plant is characterized by its thorny stems, trifoliate leaves, and small, aggregate fruits that mature to a dark purple or black color. It produces white to pale yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by the development of its edible berries. The species is valued both for its ecological role and its use in local foraging and traditional practices."
