    "intro": "Rubus albionis, commonly known as the alpine raspberry, is a species of brambles native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its erect or spreading growth habit and produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or yellow in color. The plant has trifoliate leaves with serrated margins and thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations. It is adapted to cold climates and is often found in alpine tundra and subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator species of high-altitude ecosystems."
