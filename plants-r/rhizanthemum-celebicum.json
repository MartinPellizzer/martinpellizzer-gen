    "intro": "Rhizanthemum celebicum, commonly known as the ground orchid, is a rare and unique flowering plant native to the island of Flores in Indonesia. It is notable for being one of the few flowering plants that can grow entirely underground, with its roots and rhizomes forming the primary structure. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that emerge from the soil surface, often in clusters. Its botanical features include a lack of leaves and a specialized root system that supports its subterranean growth. Due to its elusive nature and limited habitat, it is considered a critically endangered species."
