    "intro": "Ranunculus spicatus subsp. aspromontanus, commonly known as the alpine buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its basal rosette of palmately lobed leaves and bright yellow, actinomorphic flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. It is a member of the Ranunculaceae family, known for its showy flowers and often toxic compounds. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and localized species in its native range."
