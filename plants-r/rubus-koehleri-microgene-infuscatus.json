    "intro": "Rubus koehleri microgene infuscatus, commonly known as the dark-stemmed blackberry, is a species of bramble native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark, woody stems and small, clustered flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant produces edible berries that are typically dark purple to black in color, with a tart flavor. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
