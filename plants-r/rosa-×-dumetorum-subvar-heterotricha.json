    "intro": "Rosa \u00d7 dumetorum subvar. heterotricha, commonly known as the alpine rose, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to deep pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets, and the flowers are often borne in tight, rounded inflorescences. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
