    "intro": "Rollandia sessilifolia, commonly known as the sessile-leaf rollandia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are sessile, meaning they are attached directly to the stem without a stalk. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically in dense inflorescences, and are often pink or purple in color. Rollandia sessilifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique foliage and floral display."
