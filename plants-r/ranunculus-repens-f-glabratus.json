    "intro": "Ranunculus repens f. glabratus, commonly known as the smooth trailing buttercup, is a variant of the trailing buttercup characterized by its smooth, hairless stems and leaves. It is a low-growing perennial plant that typically thrives in moist, shady environments such as stream banks and woodland edges. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom in early spring. Its leaves are usually alternate, heart-shaped, and have a distinctive hairy texture in the wild form, though this is reduced in the glabratus form. This subspecies is often found in temperate regions of Europe and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
