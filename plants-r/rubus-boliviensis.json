    "intro": "Rubus boliviensis, commonly known as the Bolivian bramble, is a species of flowering plant in the rose family, Rosaceae. It is native to the Andean regions of South America, particularly Bolivia and Peru, where it thrives in high-altitude grasslands and shrublands. The plant is characterized by its thorny stems, trifoliate leaves, and clusters of small, white or pink flowers that bloom in spring. Its fruits, known as berries, are edible and often consumed fresh or used in local cuisine. Rubus boliviensis plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by providing food for various wildlife species."
