    "intro": "Remijia roraimae, commonly known as the Roraima sun orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the tepuis of Venezuela. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow and orange flowers, which bloom during the dry season. The plant grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the unique microclimates of the tepuis. Its flowers are pollinated by specific species of bees and hummingbirds, contributing to its ecological significance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
