    "intro": "Roegneria dura, commonly known as hardy wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces dense clusters of spikelets, which are the primary reproductive structures in grasses. Roegneria dura is well adapted to cold climates and can thrive in a variety of soil types. It is often used in ornamental horticulture and for erosion control due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
