    "intro": "Rottboellia sulcata, commonly known as the African grass or zigzag grass, is a perennial grass species native to Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, zigzag-shaped leaf blades and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, pale green spikelets that are often clustered at the base of the leaf sheaths. Rottboellia sulcata is adapted to tropical and subtropical climates and thrives in well-drained soils. It is often used in ornamental gardening and as a ground cover due to its attractive appearance and hardiness."
