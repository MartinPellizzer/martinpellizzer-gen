    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 steriliflorus, commonly known as the sterile flower raspberry, is a hybrid plant belonging to the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. Despite its floral appearance, it is largely sterile, meaning it does not produce viable seeds. This sterility makes it an interesting subject for botanical study, particularly in the context of hybridization and reproductive biology."
