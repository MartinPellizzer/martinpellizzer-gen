    "intro": "Rubus pubescens f. spectabilis, commonly known as the showy blackberry, is a distinctive variant of the blackberry plant characterized by its striking floral display. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is known for its large, showy white to pink flowers that appear in early summer. The plant produces edible berries that are typically smaller and more intensely flavored than those of the common blackberry. Its foliage is covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. This cultivar is often cultivated for its ornamental value as well as its delicious fruit."
