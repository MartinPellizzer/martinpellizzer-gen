It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black in color. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including woodlands and shrublands, and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its hardy nature, it is a common sight in the Pacific Northwest region."
