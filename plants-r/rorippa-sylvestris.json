    "intro": "Rorippa sylvestris, commonly known as the wild watercress, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North America. It is characterized by its alternate, broadly ovate leaves that are usually submerged or floating in aquatic environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils near streams, ponds, and wetlands. Rorippa sylvestris is often used in traditional medicine and is also a food source for various aquatic animals."
