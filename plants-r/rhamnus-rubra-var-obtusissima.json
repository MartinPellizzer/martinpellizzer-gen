The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by dark blue berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open woodlands or along rocky slopes. Its botanical features make it an important component of local ecosystems and a subject of interest in botanical studies."
