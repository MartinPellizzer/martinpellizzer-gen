It is characterized by its dense, thorny growth habit and dark green, leathery leaves. The plant produces small, edible blackberries that are typically harvested in late summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
