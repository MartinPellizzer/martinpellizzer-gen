It is characterized by its slender, thorny stems and palmate leaves with rounded lobes. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black when ripe. It thrives in moist, wooded areas and is often found in the understory of deciduous forests. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
