    "intro": "Reseda media var. longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed dyer's weed, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a member of the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Its leaves are linear and slightly hairy, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Reseda media var. longipes has been historically used in dyeing textiles due to the presence of flavonoids in its flowers."
