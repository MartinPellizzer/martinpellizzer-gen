    "intro": "Rumex orbiculatus, commonly known as roundleaf dock, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features heart-shaped, smooth-edged leaves that are typically dark green and slightly succulent. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are borne on erect, branching stems. Its root system is fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing it to spread and colonize moist, disturbed soils. It is often found in wetlands, along stream banks, and in damp meadows."
