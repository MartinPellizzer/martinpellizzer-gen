It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy inflorescences that consist of multiple violet or purple flowers. The plant produces a cluster of narrow, grass-like leaves and has a distinctive, rounded bulb that serves as its storage organ. It typically blooms in spring and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens, though it requires well-drained soil and full sun to thrive."
