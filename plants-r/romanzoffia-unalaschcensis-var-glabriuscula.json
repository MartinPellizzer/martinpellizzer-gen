    "intro": "Romanzoffia unalaschcensis var. glabriuscula, commonly known as the Alaska marsh sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western regions of North America. It typically grows in wetland and marsh habitats, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable environments. This variety is distinguished by its reduced hairy structures compared to other varieties within the species."
