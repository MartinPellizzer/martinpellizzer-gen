    "intro": "Robinia chinensis, commonly known as the Chinese honey locust, is a deciduous leguminous tree native to China. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically pinnately arranged with 15 to 30 small leaflets. The tree produces yellow pea-like flowers in early summer, followed by long, slender pods that contain flattened seeds. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in various soil conditions. The plant also has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion."
