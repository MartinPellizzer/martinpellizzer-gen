    "intro": "Rosa agrestis f. lanuginea, commonly known as the woolly bramble rose, is a shrub-like plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems covered in a dense, woolly layer of hairs, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are compound, with five to seven oval leaflets, and the plant is often found in woodland edges and hedgerows. Rosa agrestis f. lanuginea is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in hedgerow management."
