    "intro": "Rubus macrostachys var. holorhodos, commonly known as the woolly blackberry, is a shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and thorny stems, which provide structural support and protection. The plant produces aggregate fruits, typically dark purple to black in color, which are edible but often have a tart flavor. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or wetland habitats. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and local biodiversity."
