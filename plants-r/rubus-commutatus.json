    "intro": "Rubus commutatus, commonly known as the trailing blackberry, is a species of bramble native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and thorny stems, which help it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark red to black in color. Its leaves are compound, with three to five leaflets that are serrated and have a slightly hairy texture. Rubus commutatus thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
