    "intro": "Rubus tumidus var. longepetiolatus, commonly known as the long-petioled raspberry, is a variant of the raspberry species native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its elongated petioles, which are the stalks connecting the leaves to the stem. The plant produces aggregate fruits composed of small, bright red drupelets that ripen in late summer. Its leaves are typically compound, with three to five leaflets, and are covered in fine, silvery hairs. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and edible fruits, though it is less common than other raspberry types."
