    "intro": "Rubus argenteus var. pubiramus, commonly known as the silverleaf bramble, is a deciduous shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its silvery-white undersides on its leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, edible berries that are typically red or black when mature. Its stems are covered in fine, white hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats."
