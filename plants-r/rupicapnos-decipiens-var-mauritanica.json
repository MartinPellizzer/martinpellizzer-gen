    "intro": "Rupicapnos decipiens var. mauritanica, commonly known as the false heath or desert buckthorn, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North Africa. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant is adapted to harsh environments, with deep roots that help it survive in dry conditions. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain seeds. This species is often used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
