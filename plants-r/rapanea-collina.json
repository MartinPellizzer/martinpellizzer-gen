    "intro": "Rapanea collina, commonly known as the mountain holly, is a small evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. The plant has leathery, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. Its small, white flowers are clustered in umbels and are followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for birds. The wood of Rapanea collina is hard and durable, historically used in traditional crafts and construction."
