It is a shrub with thorny stems and compound leaves that are typically serrated. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are often red or yellow in color. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland or hedgerow environments. Its botanical characteristics make it distinct from other Rubus species, particularly in its morphological traits and habitat preferences."
