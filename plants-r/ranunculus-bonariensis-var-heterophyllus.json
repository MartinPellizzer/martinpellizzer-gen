It features showy, cup-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, with 5 to 15 petal-like sepals. The plant has alternate, palmately lobed leaves that vary in shape depending on the growth conditions. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its botanical variability makes it an interesting subject for taxonomic study."
