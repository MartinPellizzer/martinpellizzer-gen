It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant features basal rosettes of lanceolate, serrated leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in dense, terminal inflorescences. The species is notable for its medicinal properties and has been used historically in traditional remedies."
