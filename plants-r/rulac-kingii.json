    "intro": "Rulac kingii, commonly known as the King's rulac, is a rare and lesser-known plant species native to the high-altitude regions of East Africa. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes many flowering plants known for their ornamental value. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, often blooming during the cooler months. Its leaves are typically narrow and evergreen, adapted to thrive in shaded, moist environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Rulac kingii is considered a species of conservation concern."
