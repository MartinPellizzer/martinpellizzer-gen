    "intro": "Rosa canina f. oblonga, commonly known as the oval hips rose, is a botanical variant of the dog rose. It is characterized by its elongated, oval-shaped fruit, which differs from the typical round hips of the standard Rosa canina. The plant produces fragrant pink flowers in early summer, followed by the distinctive, red-orange hips in autumn. It is a deciduous shrub that thrives in temperate climates and is often found in hedgerows and woodland edges. This form is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal medicine."
