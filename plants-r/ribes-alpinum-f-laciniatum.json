It is a deciduous shrub native to the alpine regions of Europe, characterized by its finely lobed, serrated leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green berries that are typically edible but less commonly consumed due to their tart flavor. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous habitats. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
