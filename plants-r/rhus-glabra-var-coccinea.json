    "intro": "Rhus glabra var. coccinea, commonly known as the staghorn sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown stems that become rough and furrowed with age. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, fuzzy berries that persist into winter. Its leaves are alternate, pinnately compound, and turn bright red in the fall. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
