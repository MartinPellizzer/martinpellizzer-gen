    "intro": "Rubus cupressorum, commonly known as the creeping raspberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its dense, thorny stems that often form mats on the ground. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, raspberry-like fruits in the summer. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a serrated edge, while the stems are covered in fine, glandular hairs. Rubus cupressorum is often found in moist, shady areas such as woodlands and stream banks."
