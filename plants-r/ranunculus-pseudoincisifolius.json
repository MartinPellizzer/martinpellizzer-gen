    "intro": "Ranunculus pseudoincisifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaf buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features delicate, palmately divided leaves with a distinctive narrow, serrated edge. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with five petals, often adorned with a central tuft of stamens. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
