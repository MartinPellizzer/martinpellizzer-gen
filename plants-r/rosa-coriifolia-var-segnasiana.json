    "intro": "Rosa coriifolia var. segnasiana, commonly known as the Segna's sweetbriar, is a rare and ornamental shrub native to China. It is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in early spring, typically in shades of pink and white. The plant features thorny stems and lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. It prefers well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Due to its limited distribution and conservation status, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique botanical and horticultural value."
