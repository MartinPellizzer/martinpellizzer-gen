It features small, oval leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by small, black berries that are a source of food for birds. It is native to southern Europe and thrives in sunny, well-drained soils. Its compact form and ornamental berries make it a popular choice for hedging and ornamental gardening."
