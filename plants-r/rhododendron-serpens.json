    "intro": "Rhododendron serpens, commonly known as the creeping rhododendron, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It features dense, evergreen foliage with lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, typically blooming in spring. Its growth habit is low and spreading, making it suitable for ground cover in shaded environments. Rhododendron serpens is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in moist, acidic soils."
