It features basal leaves that are palmately lobed and covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces showy yellow flowers with five to nine petals, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges.
