    "intro": "Rhinanthus pallidus, commonly known as the pale rhinoceros flower, is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on other plants for nutrients through its roots. The species typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Its flowers are arranged in dense spikes and bloom from June to August. Rhinanthus pallidus is often found in areas with sandy or loamy soils and is considered a rare and declining species in parts of its range."
