    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 uncinatus, commonly known as the trailing blackberry, is a hybrid species within the Rubus genus. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and thorny stems, which help it climb and spread across surfaces. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black when mature. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil. This species is often cultivated for its edible berries, which have a tart flavor and are used in jams and wines."
