    "intro": "Ranunculus fallax subsp. kyyhkynenii, commonly known as the Kyyhkynen's buttercup, is a rare and endangered subspecies native to Finland. It is a herbaceous perennial with delicate, palmately divided leaves and showy yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant prefers moist, calcareous soils in woodland or streamside habitats. It is characterized by its distinctive leaf morphology and is often found in small, isolated populations. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are critical for its survival."
