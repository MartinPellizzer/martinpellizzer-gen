    "intro": "Rhamnus neblinensis, commonly known as the Neblin's buckthorn, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, thorny branches and small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, followed by reddish or black berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and natural habitats."
