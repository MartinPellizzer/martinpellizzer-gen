    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 albicans, commonly known as the white raspberry, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Rubus idaeus (red raspberry) and Rubus strigosus (blackberry). It is characterized by its thorny stems and aggregate fruits that are typically white or pale yellow in color. The plant thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils. Its flowers are usually pink or white, and it produces edible berries that are smaller and less tart than those of its parent species. Due to its ornamental value and unique fruit characteristics, it is cultivated in some regions for both horticultural and culinary purposes."
