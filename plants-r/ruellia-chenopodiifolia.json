    "intro": "Ruellia chenopodiifolia, commonly known as the desert ruellia, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple, typically blooming in the spring and summer. Ruellia chenopodiifolia is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping. Its ecological importance includes providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a host plant for certain butterfly species."
