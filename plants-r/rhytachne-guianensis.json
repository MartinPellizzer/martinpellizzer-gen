It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly in Guyana, Suriname, and French Guiana. The plant is characterized by its long, flexible stems and large, pinnate leaves that can reach up to several meters in length. It produces small, clustered flowers followed by fibrous fruits containing seeds. Rhytachne guianensis is valued for its strong, durable fibers, which have been traditionally used in basket-making and other crafts."
