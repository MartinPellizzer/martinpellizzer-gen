    "intro": "Rhadinothamnus euphemiae, commonly known as the Euphemia's thornbush, is a shrub native to Western Australia. It belongs to the Proteaceae family and is characterized by its woody stems and dense foliage. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. Rhadinothamnus euphemiae is adapted to sandy soils and is typically found in coastal and inland regions with low rainfall."
