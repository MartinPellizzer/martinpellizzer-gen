    "intro": "Restio fourcadei, commonly known as the Fourcade's restio, is a species of flowering plant in the Restiaceae family. It is native to South Africa, specifically the Western Cape region, where it grows in coastal fynbos vegetation. The plant is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with long, narrow leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to the Mediterranean climate of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
