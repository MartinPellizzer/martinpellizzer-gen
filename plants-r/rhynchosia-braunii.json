    "intro": "Rhynchosia braunii, commonly known as the African butterbean, is a climbing legume native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It features trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces and produces small, yellow flowers that are followed by elongated, pod-like fruits. The plant is characterized by its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules. Rhynchosia braunii is often used in traditional medicine and as a forage crop for livestock. Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and agricultural contexts."
