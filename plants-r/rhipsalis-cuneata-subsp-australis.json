    "intro": "Rhipsalis cuneata subsp. australis, commonly known as the Australian candelabra cactus, is a unique species belonging to the Cactaceae family. It is characterized by its branching, shrub-like growth habit with long, slender, and often twisted stems. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are reduced to small, spine-like structures, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. This subspecies is native to parts of Australia and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its distinctive appearance."
