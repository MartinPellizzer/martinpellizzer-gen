    "intro": "Rhododendron selense subsp. setiferum, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada rhododendron, is a subshrub native to the western United States, particularly found in the Sierra Nevada range. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas, often at high elevations. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, providing a striking contrast to the vibrant floral displays. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological diversity of its native habitat."
