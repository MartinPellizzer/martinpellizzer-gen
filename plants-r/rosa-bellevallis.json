    "intro": "Rosa bellevallis, commonly known as the sweetbriar rose, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern and central United States. It is characterized by its thorny stems, compound leaves, and clusters of fragrant, pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, red-orange fruits called hips, which are rich in vitamin C. Rosa bellevallis thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight, making it a common sight in woodland edges and hedgerows. Its ornamental value and historical use in herbal medicine contribute to its ecological and cultural significance."
