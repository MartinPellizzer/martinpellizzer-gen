    "intro": "Roscoea tibetica, commonly known as the Tibetan ginger, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Zingiberaceae family, which includes gingers and turmeric, and is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit. The plant produces striking, sword-shaped leaves and tall, showy inflorescences with brightly colored flowers, often in shades of red, orange, and yellow. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique foliage. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is relatively rare in cultivation outside its native range."
