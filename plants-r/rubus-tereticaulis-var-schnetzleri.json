    "intro": "Rubus tereticaulis var. schnetzleri, commonly known as the Schneetzler's trailing raspberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features slender, arching stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats or small colonies. The leaves are trifoliate, with three oval to lance-shaped leaflets that are hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits composed of numerous drupes, which are typically red when ripe. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats."
