    "intro": "Rubus flavescentispinus, commonly known as the yellow-spined blackberry, is a species of bramble native to parts of eastern North America. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by berries that ripen to a dark purple or black color. Its fruit is edible, though often tart, and is used in local cuisines and traditional medicine. The plant thrives in moist, wooded areas and is an important component of its native ecosystem."
