    "intro": "Rosa alpina var. affinis, commonly known as the Alpine rose, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically oval to lance-shaped with a slightly serrated margin. The plant produces showy, single or double pink to white flowers in the spring, which are borne on pedicels that are often slightly hairy. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to tolerate cold climates."
