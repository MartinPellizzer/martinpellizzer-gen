    "intro": "Ranunculus macrophyllus f. macranthus, commonly known as the giant leaf buttercup, is a striking herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves that can reach up to 20 cm in diameter, giving it a bold, dramatic appearance. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with prominent, spurred sepals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, rich soils and is often found in wetlands, streambanks, and woodland edges. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and wetland restoration projects."
