    "intro": "Rhododendron taibaiense, commonly known as the Taibai rhododendron, is a rare and endemic species native to China's Hengduan Mountains. It is characterized by its striking, large, showy flowers that are typically pink to purple in color. The plant is evergreen, with leathery, dark green leaves that are elliptical in shape. It thrives in cool, moist, and shaded forest environments at high altitudes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
