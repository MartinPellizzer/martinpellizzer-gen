    "intro": "Rosularia radiciflora subsp. kurdica, commonly known as the Kurdish root rose, is a low-growing, perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Kurdistan. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, succulent stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically produces pink or white flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often covered in a fine, white pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Rosularia radiciflora subsp. kurdica is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, making it a hardy species suited to harsh, mountainous climates."
