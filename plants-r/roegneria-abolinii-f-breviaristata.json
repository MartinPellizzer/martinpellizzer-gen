    "intro": "Roegneria abolinii f. breviaristata, commonly known as the compact wheatgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to Central Asia. It features tufted, compact growth with slender, blue-green leaves that are typically shorter than those of the species. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, which are characteristic of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry, open habitats. Its dense growth habit makes it suitable for erosion control and ornamental use in gardens."
