    "intro": "Rhizophora gymnorhiza, commonly known as the mangrove apple or white mangrove, is a tropical tree species native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in saline and waterlogged soils, making it an essential component of mangrove ecosystems. The plant possesses specialized roots called pneumatophores, which extend above the soil surface to facilitate gas exchange in oxygen-poor environments. Its leaves are typically alternate and elliptical, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. The fruit is a small, smooth, fleshy drupe that plays a role in seed dispersal by water and animals."
