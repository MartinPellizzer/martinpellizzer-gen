    "intro": "Rubus thyrsoideus var. simplicidentatus, commonly known as the simple-toothed bramble, is a shrub native to parts of eastern North America. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated margins. The flowers are typically white or pale pink, and the plant produces edible berries that are often used in local foraging. It thrives in woodland edges and disturbed soils, preferring partial shade to full sun. This variety is distinguished by its simpler leaf dentation compared to other Rubus species."
