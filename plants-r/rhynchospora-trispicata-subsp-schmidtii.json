It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and clustered inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and other moist habitats, where it thrives in nutrient-rich soils. Its flowering spikes bear small, three-bracted flowers, which are usually greenish or brownish in color. This subspecies is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and supporting local biodiversity."
