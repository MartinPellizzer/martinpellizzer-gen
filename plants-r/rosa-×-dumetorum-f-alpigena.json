It is characterized by its compact growth habit and profuse display of semi-double pink to white flowers. The plant is native to the alpine regions of Europe and thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and rockeries due to its hardiness and ability to withstand harsh conditions. The foliage is typically dark green with a slightly fuzzy texture, adding to its visual appeal."
