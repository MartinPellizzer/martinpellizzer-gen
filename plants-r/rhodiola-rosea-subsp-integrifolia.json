    "intro": "Rhodiola rosea subsp. integrifolia, commonly known as the golden root, is a perennial herb native to the cold climates of the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its fleshy, succulent stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by red or orange berries. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and tundra environments. Rhodiola rosea subsp. integrifolia is valued for its adaptogenic properties and has been used in traditional medicine for centuries."
