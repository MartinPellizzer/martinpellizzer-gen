    "intro": "Rubus wrightii var. inermis, commonly known as the Wright's blackberry, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its thornless stems, which distinguish it from other Rubus species. The plant produces aggregate fruits, typically black or dark purple, that are edible and have a tart flavor. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. Its botanical features make it an important species for both ecological studies and local biodiversity."
