    "intro": "Ribes glaciale var. laciniatum, commonly known as the Alpine gooseberry, is a variant of the glacier gooseberry native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its finely toothed, dark green leaves that turn red in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are followed by edible, tart berries that ripen in late summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous areas with well-drained soil. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
