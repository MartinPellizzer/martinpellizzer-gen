    "intro": "Rosa parasicula, commonly known as the rare or ghost rose, is a species of flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its small, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has slender, thornless stems and dark green, lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Rosa parasicula is considered a rare and endangered species."
