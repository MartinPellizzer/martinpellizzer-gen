    "intro": "Rosa subolida var. anacantha, commonly known as the thorned rose, is a variant of the Rosa subolida species native to parts of South America. It is characterized by its dense, shrub-like growth habit and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white, typically blooming in the spring. Its stems are covered in sharp, thorn-like structures, which serve as a natural defense mechanism. The leaves are compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets, and the plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value."
