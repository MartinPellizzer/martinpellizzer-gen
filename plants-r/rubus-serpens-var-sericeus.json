    "intro": "Rubus serpens var. sericeus, commonly known as the silky blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and slender, serpentine stems that often root at the nodes. The leaves are typically trifoliate, with finely toothed margins and a silvery-white underside that gives it a distinctive appearance. Its flowers are small, white, and clustered in axillary cymes, followed by dark purple to black berries. This plant is often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and stream banks."
