    "intro": "Rubus pilatensis, commonly known as the Pilat raspberry, is a species of bramble native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or orange in color. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
