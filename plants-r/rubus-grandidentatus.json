    "intro": "Rubus grandidentatus, commonly known as the large-toothed blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its prickly stems and compound leaves with large, serrated lobes. The plant produces aggregate fruits composed of tiny, achenes surrounded by a fleshy receptacle. It thrives in moist, fertile soils and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. The berries are edible, though they are generally less sweet and more tart compared to other blackberry varieties."
