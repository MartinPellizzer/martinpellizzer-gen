    "intro": "Rosa deminuens, commonly known as the shrinking rose, is a rare and enigmatic species of shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that range in color from pale pink to white, often appearing in small clusters. The plant's leaves are typically compound, with finely serrated edges, and its stems are covered in soft, pale hairs. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, Rosa deminuens is considered a vulnerable species. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest for both horticulturists and botanists studying alpine flora."
