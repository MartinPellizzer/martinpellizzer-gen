    "intro": "Raphanus arvensis, commonly known as the field radish, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its upright, branching stems and pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in umbels, which are followed by round, fleshy fruits known as siliques. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides. The field radish is known for its rapid growth and ability to compete with crops, making it a common weed."
