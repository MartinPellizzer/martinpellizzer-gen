    "intro": "Rosa lucieae subvar. glandulifera, commonly known as the glandular rose, is a shrub-like species native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of fragrant, pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are typically pinnately compound, with serrated leaflets and glandular dots that give the plant its subspecies name. The stems are often armed with thorns, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in suitable climates."
