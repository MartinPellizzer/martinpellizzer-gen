    "intro": "Richeria spruceana, commonly known as the red maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its vibrant red foliage in autumn, which makes it a popular ornamental plant. The tree has opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges and produces small, clustered flowers in the spring. Its seeds are enclosed in samaras, which are winged fruits that aid in wind dispersal. Richeria spruceana thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers moist, well-drained conditions."
