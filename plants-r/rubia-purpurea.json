    "intro": "Rubia purpurea, commonly known as purple knotweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes many species of shrubs and herbs. The plant is characterized by its slender, creeping stems and small, opposite leaves that are often hairy. Its flowers are typically pale purple or white, arranged in clusters, and it produces small, round berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. Rubia purpurea is often found in woodland areas and along stream banks, where it thrives in moist, shaded conditions."
