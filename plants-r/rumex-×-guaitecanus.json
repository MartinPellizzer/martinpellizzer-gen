    "intro": "Rumex \u00d7 guaitecanus, commonly known as the Mexican sorrel, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Rumex acetosa (common sorrel) and Rumex acetobulus (broadleaf sorrel). It is a perennial herb native to Mexico, characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and reddish veins. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its rhubarb-like leaves are edible, though they contain oxalic acid and should be cooked before consumption. The botanical interest of Rumex \u00d7 guaitecanus lies in its hybrid nature and its role in both traditional medicine and horticulture."
