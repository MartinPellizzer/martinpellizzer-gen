    "intro": "Rubus effertus, commonly known as the alpine blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and produces small, edible berries that are typically dark red to black in color. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and its flowers are white with five petals. Rubus effertus is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and attractive foliage."
