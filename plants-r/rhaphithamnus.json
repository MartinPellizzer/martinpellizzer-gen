    "intro": "Rhaphithamnus, commonly known as the desert broom, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Rhamnaceae. These shrubs are native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia. They are characterized by their small, often thorny stems and clusters of yellow or greenish flowers. The leaves are typically small, ovate, and may have a slightly hairy texture. Rhaphithamnus species are adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, often with deep root systems to access groundwater."
