It is characterized by its delicate, yellow flowers with five petals and a central cluster of stamens. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a hairy surface that helps retain moisture in harsh environments. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often found in botanical gardens and wildflower meadows."
