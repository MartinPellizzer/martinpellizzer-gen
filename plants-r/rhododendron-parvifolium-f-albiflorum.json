    "intro": "Rhododendron parvifolium f. albiflorum, commonly known as the white-flowered alpine rhododendron, is a compact, deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It features small, ovate leaves that are typically densely packed and covered in a fine, silvery-white bloom. The plant produces clusters of white, funnel-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in cool, moist, acidic soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is a sought-after plant for native gardens and conservation efforts."
