    "intro": "Rubus lejeunei var. carneiflorus, commonly known as the red-flowered blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive red, fleshy flowers that contrast with its dark, thorny stems. The leaves are typically trifoliate, with a serrated margin, and the plant produces small, edible berries similar to other Rubus species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The plant's ornamental value is enhanced by its vibrant floral display and unique fruit characteristics."
