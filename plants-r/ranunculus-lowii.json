    "intro": "Ranunculus lowii, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada buttercup, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of California and Nevada. It is characterized by its delicate, bright yellow flowers with five petals and a hairy, upright stem. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as meadows and forest floors. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Ranunculus lowii is a herbaceous perennial that blooms in early spring, contributing to the biodiversity of its alpine habitat."
