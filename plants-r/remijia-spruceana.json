    "intro": "Remijia spruceana, commonly known as the Spruce's remijia, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its delicate, nodding flowers that are typically white or pale blue in color. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Its leaves are elliptical and have a smooth, waxy texture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
