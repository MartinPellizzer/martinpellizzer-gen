    "intro": "Rhabdosciadium microcalycinum, commonly known as the dwarf starflower, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It features delicate, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in late summer. The plant has a compact growth habit with hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
