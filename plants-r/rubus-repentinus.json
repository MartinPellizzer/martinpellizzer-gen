It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that ripen to a dark purple or black color. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, loamy soils. Rubus repentinus is often found in woodland edges, hedgerows, and disturbed areas."
