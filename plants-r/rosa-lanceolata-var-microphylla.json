    "intro": "Rosa lanceolata var. microphylla, commonly known as the miniature rose or dwarf rose, is a compact shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features small, glossy, dark green leaves that are lance-shaped and densely arranged along the stems. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, single or semi-double pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is well-suited for rock gardens, containers, and as a ground cover due to its low-growing habit. Its hardy nature and ornamental value make it a popular choice in horticulture."
