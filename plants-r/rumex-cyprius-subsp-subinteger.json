    "intro": "Rumex cyprius subsp. subinteger, commonly known as Cyprus sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features upright, branching stems that are often reddish in color, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a distinctive waxy coating. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are borne on erect spikes during the spring. Its leaves are edible and have a sour, tangy flavor due to the presence of oxalic acid. This subspecies is often found in rocky or limestone soils and is valued both for its culinary uses and ornamental appeal."
