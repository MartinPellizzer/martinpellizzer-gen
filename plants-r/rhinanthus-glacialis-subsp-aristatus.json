    "intro": "Rhinanthus glacialis subsp. aristatus, commonly known as the alpine yellowrocket, is a flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of the European Alps. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and slopes. Due to its specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator of alpine ecosystems."
