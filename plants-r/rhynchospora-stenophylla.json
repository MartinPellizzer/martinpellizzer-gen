    "intro": "Rhynchospora stenophylla, commonly known as narrow-leaf beakspur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, commonly known as the sedge family, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with slender, triangular stems. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically green to reddish in color, and it blooms from late spring to early summer. Rhynchospora stenophylla thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swamps, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. It plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various insects and small vertebrates."
