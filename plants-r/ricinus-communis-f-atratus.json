    "intro": "Ricinus communis f. atratus, commonly known as the blackleaf castor, is a variant of the castor oil plant characterized by its dark green, almost black foliage. This ornamental plant is native to tropical regions and thrives in warm, humid climates. Its leaves are typically large, palmately lobed, and have a striking, glossy appearance. While it shares the same genus as the common castor plant, it is cultivated primarily for its aesthetic value rather than its oil-producing properties. The plant is often used in gardens for its dramatic visual impact and can grow up to several feet in height."
