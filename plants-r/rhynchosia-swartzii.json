It features trifoliate leaves with heart-shaped leaflets and produces showy, yellow or orange flowers that are often butterfly-shaped. The plant bears pods that contain edible seeds, similar to other members of the Fabaceae family. It is adapted to grow in disturbed soils and is often found in savannas and woodland areas. Rhynchosia swartzii is valued for its ornamental appeal and potential agricultural use."
