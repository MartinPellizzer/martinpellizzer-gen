It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, dark purple berries that are typically harvested in late summer. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and partial sunlight. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native habitat."
