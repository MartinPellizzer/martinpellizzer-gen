    "intro": "Ruellia petiolata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf ruellia, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Ruellia petiolata is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and adaptability to various soil types. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
