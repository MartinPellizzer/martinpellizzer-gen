    "intro": "Rhytispermum arvense, commonly known as the field rhytispermum, is a flowering plant belonging to the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, greenish-white flowers that appear in umbels. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields, preferring sandy or loamy soils. Its leaves are pinnately divided, with a delicate, fern-like appearance, and it produces small, dry fruits known as schizocarps. Rhytispermum arvense is often found in temperate regions and is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
