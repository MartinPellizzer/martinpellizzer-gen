It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically produces rose-like blooms in late spring to early summer, often in clusters. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and covered in a fine layer of white down. This variety is well adapted to harsh mountain environments, thriving in poor, well-drained soils."
