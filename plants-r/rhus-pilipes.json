    "intro": "Rhus pilipes, commonly known as the staghorn sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and have a serrated edge. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in upright clusters, followed by red, fuzzy berries that are a food source for birds and other wildlife. Its bark is rough and furrowed, often resembling the texture of a stag's horn, hence its common name. Rhus pilipes thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in open woods, along roadsides, and in disturbed areas."
