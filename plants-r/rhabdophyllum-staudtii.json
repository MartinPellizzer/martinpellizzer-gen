    "intro": "Rhabdophyllum staudtii, commonly known as the Staudt's clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is a small, evergreen shrub that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or rocky crevices. The plant features whorled leaves that are often scale-like and may have a distinctive club-shaped appearance. Its reproductive structures, called strobila, are cone-like and produce spores for propagation. Rhabdophyllum staudtii is characterized by its primitive morphology, reflecting its ancient lineage within the lycophyte group."
