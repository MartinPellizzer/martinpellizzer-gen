    "intro": "Rhynchospora terminalis var. rosemariana, commonly known as the rosemary marsh sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments in North America. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often reddish or purple-tinged. The plant produces small, three-lobed flowers arranged in dense spikes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in bogs, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems, supporting various pollinators and contributing to soil stabilization."
