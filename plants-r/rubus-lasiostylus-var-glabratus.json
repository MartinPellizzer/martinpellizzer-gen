It is a shrub characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with three to five leaflets. The flowers are typically white or pale pink, and the plant produces small, edible berries that are often used in local foraging. It thrives in moist, wooded areas and is adapted to temperate climates. The smooth-styled bramble plays a role in supporting local wildlife, including birds and insects, through its flowers and fruits."
