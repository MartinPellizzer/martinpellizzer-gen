    "intro": "Rorippa pyrenaica proles hispanica, commonly known as the Iberian watercress, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It typically grows in wetlands, stream edges, and damp soils, thriving in temperate climates. The plant has slender, branching stems with small, alternate, ovate leaves that are usually submerged or floating. Its flowers are white or pale pink, arranged in clusters, and it produces small, elongated siliques containing numerous seeds. This species is valued for its edible leaves, which have a peppery flavor similar to watercress."
