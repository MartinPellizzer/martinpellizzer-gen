    "intro": "Rosa soulieana var. microphylla, commonly known as the miniature pink bush rose, is a compact, shrub-like rose with small, glossy leaves and abundant clusters of fragrant, pink flowers. It is native to China and is prized for its ornamental value in gardens due to its dense growth habit and continuous blooming throughout the growing season. The plant typically reaches a height of around 1 to 2 feet, making it ideal for containers, borders, or as a ground cover. Its flowers, which range from pale pink to deep rose, attract pollinators and add visual interest to any landscape. It is relatively low maintenance and resistant to many common rose diseases."
