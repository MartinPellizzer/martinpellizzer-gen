    "intro": "Rosa \u00d7 dumetorum var. burnatii, commonly known as the Burnat's shrub rose, is a compact, deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central and Eastern Europe. It typically grows to a height of 1\u20132 meters, featuring dense, thorny stems and dark green, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink to red, often blooming in late spring to early summer. Its horticultural value lies in its hardiness, adaptability to various soil types, and ability to thrive in full sun to partial shade. This variety is also valued for its use in ornamental gardening and as a natural hedge."
