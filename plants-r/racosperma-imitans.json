    "intro": "Racosperma imitans, commonly known as the mimosa tree, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a response known as thigmonasty. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in dense, globular clusters, which are followed by flat, pod-like fruits. Racosperma imitans is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in reforestation efforts due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
