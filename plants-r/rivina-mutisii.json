    "intro": "Rivina mutisii, commonly known as scarlet runner or red root, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its showy, tubular red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has opposite, simple, and often hairy leaves that are elliptical to ovate in shape. Its roots are thick and fleshy, which help it store water in its native arid environments. Rivina mutisii is often found in sandy soils along roadsides and in open woodlands."
