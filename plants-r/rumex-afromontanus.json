    "intro": "Rumex afromontanus, commonly known as the East African sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the highland regions of East Africa. It belongs to the Polygonaceae family and is characterized by its upright, branched stems and alternate, broadly ovate leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are typically arranged in inflorescences at the tips of the stems. Its leaves are edible and have a slightly sour taste due to the presence of oxalic acid. Rumex afromontanus is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and rocky slopes."
