    "intro": "Rosa canina var. abietina, commonly known as the alpine rose or mountain dog rose, is a variant of the dog rose native to high-altitude regions of Europe. It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant produces red, hairy fruits known as hips, which are rich in vitamin C. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, mountainous climates. Its botanical features make it an important species in alpine ecosystems and a subject of interest in plant taxonomy."
