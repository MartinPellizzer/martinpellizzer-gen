    "intro": "Rosa mollis subvar. caerulea, commonly known as the blue rose or blue musk rose, is a botanical variant of the species Rosa mollis. It is characterized by its pale blue to lavender-colored flowers, which are often more intensely pigmented than those of the typical Rosa mollis. The plant is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in parts of Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. This subvariety is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been cultivated for its unique floral coloration in horticultural practices."
