    "intro": "Ranunculus nontunensis, commonly known as the desert buttercup, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its delicate, yellow flowers with five petals and a hairy, glandular stem. The plant has small, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and limited water availability. Ranunculus nontunensis plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing nectar for pollinators in its ecosystem."
