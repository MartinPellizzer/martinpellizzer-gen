    "intro": "Rubus sordirosanthus, commonly known as the dark red raspberry, is a species of bramble native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, dark red berries that ripen in the fall. The plant produces compound leaves with serrated edges and pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and partial shade. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
