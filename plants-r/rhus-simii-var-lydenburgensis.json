    "intro": "Rhus simii var. lydenburgensis, commonly known as the Lydenburg holly, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, leathery leaves that are typically arranged in opposite pairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that give way to red, fleshy fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland and coastal areas. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely distributed outside its native range."
