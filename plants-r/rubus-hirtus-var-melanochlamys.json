It is characterized by its dense, thorny growth habit and dark green, often slightly hairy leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, edible berries in the summer. Its leaves and stems contain compounds that have been used traditionally in herbal remedies. The variety is distinguished by its darker foliage compared to other Rubus species."
