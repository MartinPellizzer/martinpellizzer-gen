    "intro": "Robinia procera, commonly known as the black locust, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and have a distinctive, fern-like appearance. The tree produces fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers in upright clusters during the spring. Its wood is hard and strong, making it valuable for carpentry and furniture-making. Robinia procera is also notable for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, which makes it useful in ecological restoration projects."
