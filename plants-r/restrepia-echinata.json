    "intro": "Restrepia echinata, commonly known as the echinata bromeliad, is a species of flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup. The plant produces striking inflorescences with vibrant, long-lasting flowers that range from red to orange in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens."
