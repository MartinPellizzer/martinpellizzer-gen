    "intro": "Rhynchosia senna var. texana, commonly known as the Texas senna, is a perennial legume native to the southern United States. It features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-tolerant. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in poor soil conditions. The Texas senna is often used in erosion control and as a forage plant for livestock."
