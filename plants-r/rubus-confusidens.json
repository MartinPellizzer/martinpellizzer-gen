    "intro": "Rubus confusidens, commonly known as the confused blackberry, is a species of bramble native to parts of eastern North America. It belongs to the Rubus genus, which includes many species of shrubs commonly referred to as blackberries or raspberries. The plant typically grows in moist, wooded areas and produces edible berries that are similar in taste to other Rubus species. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the plant produces white to pale pink flowers in the spring. The fruit is usually harvested in the summer and is valued for its flavor and nutritional content."
