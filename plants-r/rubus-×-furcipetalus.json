    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 furcipetalus, commonly known as the blackberry-boys, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Rubus ursinus (the American blackberry) and Rubus argutus (the prickly pear). It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black in color, containing small, edible drupelets. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is cultivated in some regions for both horticultural and culinary purposes."
