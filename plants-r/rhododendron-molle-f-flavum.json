    "intro": "Rhododendron molle f. flavum, commonly known as the golden flame rhododendron, is a compact shrub characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and showy, bell-shaped flowers. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow to orange-red flowers that bloom in early spring, adding vibrant color to gardens. It is native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia, particularly China, where it thrives in cool, humid climates. The leaves are typically dark green and glossy, providing a striking contrast to the vivid floral display. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings."
