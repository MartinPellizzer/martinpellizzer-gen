    "intro": "Rubus hybridus var. hirtiformis, commonly known as the hairy rosehip plant, is a species native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is a shrub characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, red, berry-like fruits called rosehips, which are rich in vitamin C. These rosehips are often used in traditional medicine and as a source of edible seeds. Its botanical features make it an important plant in both ecological and horticultural contexts."
