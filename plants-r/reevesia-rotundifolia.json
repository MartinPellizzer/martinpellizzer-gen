    "intro": "Reevesia rotundifolia, commonly known as the round-leaf reevesia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands and marshes of eastern Asia. It features heart-shaped, broad leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky hair, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Reevesia rotundifolia thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in swampy or boggy habitats. Its botanical characteristics make it an interesting subject for studies on wetland flora and plant adaptation."
