    "intro": "Ricinocarpus neogranatensis, commonly known as the New Granada ricin tree, is a tropical plant native to parts of South America. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and large, palmate leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by orange-red fruits that contain toxic seeds. Due to the presence of ricin, a potent toxin, it is considered dangerous and is not recommended for cultivation or consumption."
