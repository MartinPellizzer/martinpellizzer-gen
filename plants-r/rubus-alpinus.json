    "intro": "Rubus alpinus, commonly known as the alpine raspberry, is a species of bramble native to the mountainous regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, often in rocky or well-drained soils. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible and have a tart flavor, often used in jams and desserts. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it has thorny stems typical of the Rubus genus. Rubus alpinus plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing food for wildlife and stabilizing soil in high-altitude environments."
