    "intro": "Roegneria serpentina, commonly known as the snakegrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its flowers are wind-pollinated, and the seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas. Roegneria serpentina is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
