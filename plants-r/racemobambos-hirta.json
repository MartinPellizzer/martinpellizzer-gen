    "intro": "Racemobambos hirta, commonly known as the woolly bamboo, is a unique plant native to the tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the grass family, Poaceae, and is characterized by its dense, clumping growth habit. The plant features long, narrow leaves covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a woolly appearance. Its inflorescence is a panicle, with small, spikelet-like flowers arranged in a loose, branching pattern. Despite its grass-like structure, it is often mistaken for a bamboo due to its tall, cylindrical stalks and overall appearance."
