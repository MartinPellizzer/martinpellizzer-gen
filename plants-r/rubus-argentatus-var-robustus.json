It is characterized by its large, dark purple to black berries that are typically firm and have a strong, slightly tart flavor. The plant has silvery-white undersides on its leaves, which give it its common name. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, loamy soils. The shrub is often used in both commercial and home cultivation for its edible fruits and ornamental value."
