    "intro": "Rauvolfia latifolia, commonly known as the Indian snakeroot, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Asia, particularly India and Sri Lanka. It is a climbing shrub characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white or pale green flowers. The plant produces red berries that contain seeds, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Rauvolfia latifolia is notable for its medicinal properties, particularly the presence of reserpine, which has been used in traditional medicine. Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and pharmacological contexts."
