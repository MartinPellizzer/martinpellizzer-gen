    "intro": "Romulea longituba var. alticola, commonly known as the mountain romulea, is a perennial bulbous plant native to southern Africa. It produces striking, showy flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, with a distinctive tubular shape. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Its bulbs store nutrients, allowing it to survive dry periods and bloom during the rainy season. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
