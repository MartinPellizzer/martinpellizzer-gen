    "intro": "Rhododendron coruscum, commonly known as the golden rhododendron, is a striking evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are typically dark green with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces showy, clustered flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often with a reddish or purple tinge. These flowers bloom in early spring, adding vibrant color to its natural habitat. Rhododendron coruscum thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas at high elevations."
