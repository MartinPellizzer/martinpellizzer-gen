    "intro": "Remijia bergeniana, commonly known as the mountain snowbell, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lanceolate and often covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps to reduce water loss. Remijia bergeniana is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
