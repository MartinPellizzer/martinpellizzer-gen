    "intro": "Rubus pedemontanus f. declinatus, commonly known as the Alpine blackberry, is a botanical variant of the Rubus genus native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and small, dark purple to black berries that ripen in late summer. The plant typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh alpine conditions. Its foliage consists of trifoliate leaves with serrated edges, and it produces white flowers in clusters. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
