    "intro": "Ricinocarpus pancherianus, commonly known as the Pancherian's ricin tree, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its large, palm-like leaves and showy, yellow flowers. The plant produces distinctive seed pods that contain toxic seeds, which are rich in the potent toxin ricin. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its toxic properties, it is not commonly cultivated for ornamental or agricultural purposes."
