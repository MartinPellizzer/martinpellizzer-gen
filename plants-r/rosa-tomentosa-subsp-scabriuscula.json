    "intro": "Rosa tomentosa subsp. scabriuscula, commonly known as the rough-haired rose, is a shrub-like plant native to parts of Asia, including China and the Himalayas. It is characterized by its densely hairy stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, rugged appearance. The small, fragrant flowers are typically pink or white and bloom in summer. Its foliage is often grayish-green, with a rough texture due to the dense pubescence. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and aesthetic qualities."
