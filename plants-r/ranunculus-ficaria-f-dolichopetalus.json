    "intro": "Ranunculus ficaria f. dolichopetalus, commonly known as the long-petaled buttercup, is a botanical variant of the European buttercup. It is characterized by its elongated, slender petals that distinguish it from the typical form of *Ranunculus ficaria*. The plant produces bright yellow flowers with five petals, often with a dark central spot. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens and its ecological role in supporting pollinators."
