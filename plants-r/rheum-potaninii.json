    "intro": "Rheum potaninii, commonly known as the Tibetan rhubarb, is a perennial plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Polygonaceae family and is characterized by its large, arrow-shaped leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the summer months. Its rhubarb-like stems are used in traditional medicine for their laxative properties. However, it is important to note that the plant contains toxic compounds and should be handled with care."
