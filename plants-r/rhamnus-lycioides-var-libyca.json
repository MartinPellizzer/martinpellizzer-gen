It is characterized by its small, oval leaves that are typically glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by black, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along coastal areas. The species is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in ornamental horticulture."
