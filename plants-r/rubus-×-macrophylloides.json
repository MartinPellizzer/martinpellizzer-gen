    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 macrophylloides, commonly known as the evergreen blackberry, is a hybrid shrub native to the coastal regions of California and Oregon. It is characterized by its dense, thorny growth habit and dark green, leathery leaves that remain on the plant year-round. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black in color, with a tart and slightly sweet flavor. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is often cultivated in gardens and coastal landscapes."
