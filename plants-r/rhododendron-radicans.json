    "intro": "Rhododendron radicans, commonly known as the trailing forest rhododendron, is a species native to eastern North America. It is a evergreen shrub that typically grows in moist, acidic soils along stream banks and in shaded forest understories. The plant produces dense clusters of showy, pink to red flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries. Its leaves are leathery and evergreen, providing year-round foliage. Rhododendron radicans is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to form thick, low-growing mats."
