    "intro": "Rubus abstrusus, commonly known as the alpine blackberry, is a species of brambles native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and small, dark berries that mature in late summer. The plant typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and its flowers are white with five petals. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
