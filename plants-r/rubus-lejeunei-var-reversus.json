    "intro": "Rubus lejeunei var. reversus, commonly known as the reverse-leaved blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to certain regions of Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive reverse-arranged leaflets, which set it apart from other Rubus species. The plant produces small, dark berries that are typically edible, though they may have a tart flavor. Its botanical features include thorny stems and compound leaves with three to five leaflets. This variant is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and potential ecological role in its native habitat."
