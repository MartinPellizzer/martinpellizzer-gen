    "intro": "Ruppia rostellata, commonly known as the sea rocket, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments. It is a flowering plant in the family Ruppiaceae, characterized by its submersible leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal areas, estuaries, and brackish waters, where it thrives in fluctuating salinity levels. Its roots form dense mats that stabilize sediments and provide habitat for aquatic organisms. Ruppia rostellata plays a vital role in coastal ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and shoreline stabilization."
