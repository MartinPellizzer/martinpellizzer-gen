    "intro": "Rhus toxicodendron, commonly known as poison ivy, is a deciduous shrub native to North America. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets arranged opposite each other on short stalks. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by clusters of red, fuzzy fruits. It is highly allergenic, containing urushiol, a potent oil that can cause severe skin irritation in sensitive individuals. Rhus toxicodendron thrives in a variety of habitats, including woodlands, fields, and along trails."
