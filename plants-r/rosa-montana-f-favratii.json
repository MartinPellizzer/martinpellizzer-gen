    "intro": "Rosa montana f. favratii, commonly known as the Favrat's mountain rose, is a compact, deciduous shrub native to the Alps. It features dense, dark green foliage and produces clusters of fragrant, semi-double pink flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant is characterized by its upright growth habit and thorny stems, typical of many rose species. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or borders. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is a popular choice for gardeners seeking a low-maintenance yet visually appealing plant."
