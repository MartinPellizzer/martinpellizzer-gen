    "intro": "Rubus thyrsoideus f. stenotrichus, commonly known as the narrow-stemmed blackberry, is a cultivated form of the blackberry plant. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and smaller, more pointed leaves compared to the typical species. The flowers are white and clustered in dense inflorescences, which eventually develop into dark purple to black berries. This form is valued for its compact growth habit and improved fruit quality in certain climates. Botanically, it exhibits traits that make it suitable for ornamental and small-scale fruit production."
