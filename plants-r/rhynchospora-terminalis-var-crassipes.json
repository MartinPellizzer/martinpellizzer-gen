    "intro": "Rhynchospora terminalis var. crassipes, commonly known as the broad-leaved spike-rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and other grass-like plants. The plant features grass-like leaves and produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, three-lobed flowers. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often in marshes or along the edges of ponds. Its morphology is adapted to aquatic or semi-aquatic environments, with rhizomes that help it spread and establish in wetland ecosystems."
