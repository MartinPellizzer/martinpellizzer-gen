    "intro": "Rosa eremocharis, commonly known as the desert rose or the moonflower rose, is a species of flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub-like plant with woody stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are adapted to conserve water. The plant produces striking, fragrant, white flowers that open at night, emitting a strong scent to attract nocturnal pollinators. Its botanical features include a deep root system that allows it to thrive in harsh, dry environments. Rosa eremocharis is valued for its ornamental beauty and resilience in low-water landscapes."
