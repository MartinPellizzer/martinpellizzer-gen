    "intro": "Rubus cerchoviensis, commonly known as the Cerchovian blackberry, is a rare species of bramble native to the Czech Republic. It is characterized by its erect or semi-prostrate growth habit and produces small, dark berries. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in forest understories. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have serrated margins, while its flowers are usually white or pale pink. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
