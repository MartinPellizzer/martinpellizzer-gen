    "intro": "Rauvolfia membranifolia, commonly known as the Indian snakeroot, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Asia, particularly India and Sri Lanka. It is a climbing shrub that belongs to the family Rubiaceae, characterized by its opposite leaves and small, tubular flowers. The plant is notable for its medicinal properties, particularly due to the presence of alkaloids like reserpine, which have been used in traditional medicine. Its leaves are often used in Ayurvedic practices for their purported health benefits. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in dense forests."
