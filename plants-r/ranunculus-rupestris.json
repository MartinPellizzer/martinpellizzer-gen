    "intro": "Ranunculus rupestris, commonly known as the rock buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to rocky and arid environments in Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in crevices and on slopes, where it thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils. The plant features basal leaves that are palmately lobed and bright green, with a hairy surface. Its flowers are showy, with five to eight yellow petals and numerous stamens, often appearing in spring. Ranunculus rupestris is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
