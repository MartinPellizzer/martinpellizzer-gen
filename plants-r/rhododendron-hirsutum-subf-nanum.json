    "intro": "Rhododendron hirsutum subf. nanum, commonly known as the dwarf hirsute rhododendron, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of western China. It features dense, leathery foliage with a hairy texture, which helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to purple, typically blooming in late spring. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and woodland settings. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is often cultivated in horticulture for its aesthetic appeal."
