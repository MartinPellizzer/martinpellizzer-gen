    "intro": "Rubus dechenii, commonly known as the Dechen's blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves, typical of the Rubus genus. The plant produces small, dark purple berries that are edible and often used in local cuisines. It thrives in cool, temperate climates and is adapted to rocky, well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
