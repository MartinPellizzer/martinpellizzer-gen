    "intro": "Ranunculus aquatilis var. longirostris, commonly known as the long-beaked water buttercup, is a aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and streams. The plant features slender, ribbon-like leaves that are often submerged or floating, and it produces small, yellowish flowers with five petals. It is characterized by its elongated, narrow sepals that give it its common name. This variant is closely related to other members of the Ranunculaceae family and plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various organisms."
