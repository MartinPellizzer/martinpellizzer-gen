    "intro": "Racosperma scalpelliforme, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family Fabaceae. It is native to Australia and is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, bipinnate leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular or cylindrical clusters, typical of many wattles. It is often found in sandy or gravelly soils in arid and semi-arid regions. Racosperma scalpelliforme is a hardy, drought-tolerant plant that plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native wildlife."
