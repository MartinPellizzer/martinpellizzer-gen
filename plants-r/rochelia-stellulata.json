    "intro": "Rochelia stellulata, commonly known as the star coral or sea star coral, is a species of red algae belonging to the family Corallinaceae. It is characterized by its calcified, branching structure that resembles the skeletal remains of a coral. This plant thrives in marine environments, particularly in shallow, warm waters where it attaches to rocky substrates. Its bright red coloration is due to the presence of pigments such as phycoerythrin, which aid in photosynthesis. Rochelia stellulata plays an important ecological role in reef ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various marine organisms."
