    "intro": "Robertsonia semipubescens, commonly known as the Vancouver Island lomatia, is a rare flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Vancouver Island, British Columbia. It is a shrub that typically grows in moist, acidic soils and is characterized by its dense, woody structure. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers during the summer months. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often covered with fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
