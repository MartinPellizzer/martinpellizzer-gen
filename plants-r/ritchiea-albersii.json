    "intro": "Ritchiea albersii, commonly known as the Albers' cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species belonging to the Cycadaceae family. It is native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia, and is characterized by its stout, trunk-like stem and feather-like foliage. The plant produces cones instead of flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. Ritchiea albersii is a slow-growing, long-lived species that plays an important role in its ecosystem. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is listed as endangered, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival."
