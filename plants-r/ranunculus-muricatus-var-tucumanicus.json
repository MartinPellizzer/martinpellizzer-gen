    "intro": "Ranunculus muricatus var. tucumanicus, commonly known as the Tucum\u00e1n buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South America. It features a basal rosette of palmately lobed leaves with a hairy underside. The plant produces showy yellow flowers with five sepals and numerous stamens, typical of the Ranunculaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed areas. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens but requires careful handling as it contains toxic compounds."
