    "intro": "Rubus oblongulus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf blackberry, is a species of brambles native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its thorny stems and aggregate fruits that ripen to a dark purple or black color. The plant typically grows in moist woodlands and along stream banks, preferring partial to full shade. Its leaves are elliptical in shape with a serrated margin and are usually covered in fine hairs. The flowers are white with five petals and are followed by the edible, though tart, berries that are used in local foraging and traditional practices."
