    "intro": "Rosa tomentella var. abietina, commonly known as the alpine rose or snow rose, is a shrub native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas and adjacent regions. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and clusters of fragrant, pink to white flowers. The plant thrives in cold, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its leaves are typically covered in a thick layer of white tomentum, which helps insulate the plant from harsh weather conditions. Rosa tomentella var. abietina is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable climate conditions."
