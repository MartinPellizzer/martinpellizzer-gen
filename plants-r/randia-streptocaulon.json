    "intro": "Randia streptocaulon, commonly known as the redroot randia, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, with woody stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink to red in color, which bloom during the summer months. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, dark seeds. Randia streptocaulon is often found in moist, tropical environments and is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value."
