    "intro": "Rhigiocarya, commonly known as the mountain ash or rowan tree, is a genus of deciduous trees and shrubs belonging to the rose family (Rosaceae). It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically opposite and pinnate, and its clusters of small, showy flowers that bloom in spring. The fruit is a red or orange berry, often containing one or more seeds, and is a food source for birds and other wildlife. Rhigiocarya species are native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including Europe, Asia, and North America. They are often found in mountainous or woodland areas and are valued for their ornamental beauty and ecological importance."
