    "intro": "Rhynchospora corniculata, commonly known as the horned sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in marshes, swamps, and other moist environments, often forming dense stands. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, three-lobed flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and colonize new areas effectively. Rhynchospora corniculata plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
