    "intro": "Rhynchospora longifolia, commonly known as the long-leaved flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in the Americas. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and narrow, linear leaves that often have a hairy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in moist soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Rhynchospora longifolia plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
