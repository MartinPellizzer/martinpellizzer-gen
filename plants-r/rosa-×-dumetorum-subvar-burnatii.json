    "intro": "Rosa \u00d7 dumetorum subvar. burnatii, commonly known as the Burnat's shrub rose, is a hybrid species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink to red. The plant is evergreen in its native habitat, with leathery, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of whitish down. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and persistent foliage throughout the year."
