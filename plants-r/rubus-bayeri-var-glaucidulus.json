    "intro": "Rubus bayeri var. glaucidulus, commonly known as the glaucous blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to parts of Europe. It is characterized by its dark purple to black berries and hairy, often reddish stems. The leaves are typically trifoliate, with a serrated margin and a slightly waxy texture. This plant thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges or disturbed soils. Its botanical features make it distinct from other Rubus species, particularly in its glaucous appearance and fruit morphology."
