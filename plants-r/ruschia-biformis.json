    "intro": "Ruschia biformis, commonly known as the two-lobed Ruschia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features compact, branching stems covered in dense, fleshy leaves that are typically green with red or purple hues. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Its drought tolerance and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
