    "intro": "Rhus pruinosa, commonly known as the staghorn sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically arranged in pairs and have a distinctive red or orange coloration in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into red, fuzzy berries, which are a food source for birds and other wildlife. Its bark is thick and rough, often with a whitish, waxy coating that gives it its common name. Rhus pruinosa is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in woodland edges and open areas."
