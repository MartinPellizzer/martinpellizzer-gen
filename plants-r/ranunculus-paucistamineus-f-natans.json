    "intro": "Ranunculus paucistamineus f. natans, commonly known as the floating buttercup, is a unique aquatic variant of the buttercup family. This plant is characterized by its floating leaves that are entirely submerged, with only the leaf surface visible above the water. It typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and lakes. The flowers are small, yellow, and have five petals, typical of the Ranunculaceae family. Its botanical significance lies in its adaptation to aquatic environments and its role in wetland ecosystems."
