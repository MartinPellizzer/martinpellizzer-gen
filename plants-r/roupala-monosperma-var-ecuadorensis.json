    "intro": "Roupala monosperma var. ecuadorensis, commonly known as the Ecuadorian roupala, is a shrub or small tree native to the Andean regions of Ecuador. It belongs to the family Proteaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody capsules containing its seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in cloud forests at elevations between 1,000 and 2,500 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
