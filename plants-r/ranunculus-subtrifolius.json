    "intro": "Ranunculus subtrifolius, commonly known as the three-leaved buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features basal leaves that are trifoliate, with three leaflets arranged in a distinctive clover-like pattern. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with five to seven petals, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Its ornamental value has made it a popular choice for gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
