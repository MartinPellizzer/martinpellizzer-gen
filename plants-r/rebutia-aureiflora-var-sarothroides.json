It features short, ribbed stems that are typically green with a bluish tint. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its foliage is often covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss. It is well-suited for rock gardens and requires well-draining soil and full sun exposure."
