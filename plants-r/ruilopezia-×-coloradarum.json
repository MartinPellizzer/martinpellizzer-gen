    "intro": "Ruilopezia \u00d7 coloradarum, commonly known as the hybrid blue grama, is a grass species native to the southwestern United States. It is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between two native grasses, Bouteloua gracilis and Bouteloua ambigens. This plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its foliage is characterized by fine, blue-green blades and it produces small, fluffy seed heads. Ruilopezia \u00d7 coloradarum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in arid environments."
