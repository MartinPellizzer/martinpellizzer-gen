It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive, silky-haired pods. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into multiple pairs of small leaflets. Racosperma lasiocarpum is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in harsh conditions."
