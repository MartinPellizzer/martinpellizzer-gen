    "intro": "Rosa bernarditae, commonly known as the Bernard's rose, is a rare and endangered species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit, with thorny stems and pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its botanical features include fragrant, five-petaled flowers and a woody structure typical of the Rosaceae family. Due to habitat loss and climate change, it is critically threatened and requires conservation efforts to survive."
