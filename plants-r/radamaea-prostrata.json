    "intro": "Radamaea prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate radamaea, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are adapted to store water, enabling it to survive in drought conditions. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, adding a vibrant touch to its habitat. Its creeping growth habit allows it to spread across the ground, forming dense mats that help prevent soil erosion. Radamaea prostrata is often found in rocky outcrops and sandy soils, where it thrives in full sun."
