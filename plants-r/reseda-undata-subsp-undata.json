    "intro": "Reseda undata subsp. undata, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its distinctive blue or violet flowers and silver-gray foliage, which are adaptations to its saline and windy environment. The plant grows in low, compact bushes and produces small, bracteate flowers that bloom in summer. It has a taproot system that helps it survive in poor, sandy soils. Sea holly is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
