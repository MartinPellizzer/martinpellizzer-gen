    "intro": "Rosa pithyophila, commonly known as the pithyophila rose, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in countries like Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. The plant is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of fragrant, pink to red flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The fruit is a dry, capsule-like structure that contains several small, hard seeds."
