It is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves and clusters of fragrant, pink to white flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant is closely related to Rosa moyesii and Rosa laevigata, and it is well adapted to shady, moist woodland environments. It is prized for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in USDA hardiness zones 5 through 8. The Christmas rose is also known for its ability to bloom even when there is still snow on the ground."
