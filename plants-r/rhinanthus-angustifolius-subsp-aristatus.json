    "intro": "Rhinanthus angustifolius subsp. aristatus, commonly known as the slender yellow-rattle, is a herbaceous plant native to Europe. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family, which includes parasitic and semi-parasitic species. The plant is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. It typically grows in grasslands and open habitats, often in association with other flowering plants. Its semi-parasitic nature allows it to derive some nutrients from its host plants while still performing photosynthesis."
