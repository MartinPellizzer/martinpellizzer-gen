    "intro": "Rubus chaerophyllus var. discolor, commonly known as the variable bramble, is a shrub native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically trifoliate or pinnate, and its small, aggregate fruits that develop from multiple flowers. The plant produces white to pale yellow flowers in early summer, followed by edible berries that are often used in local cuisines. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an important species for both ecological studies and traditional herbal practices."
