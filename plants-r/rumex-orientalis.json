    "intro": "Rumex orientalis, commonly known as oriental sorrel, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves with a reddish tinge and a distinctive sour taste due to its high oxalic acid content. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it both a useful edible plant and an ornamental species in gardens."
