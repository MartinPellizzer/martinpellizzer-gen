    "intro": "Rhinanthus minor subsp. calcareus, commonly known as the limestone yellowtop, is a flowering plant native to calcareous grasslands in Europe. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers that bloom from June to August. The plant is hemiparasitic, deriving some of its nutrients from the roots of neighboring plants. It thrives in open, sunny habitats with well-drained soils, often found in disturbed or grazed areas. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and declining species in many parts of its range."
