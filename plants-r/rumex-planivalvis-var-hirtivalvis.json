    "intro": "Rumex planivalvis var. hirtivalvis, commonly known as hairy broadleaf sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features broad, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive wavy margin and a hairy underside, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in early summer. It prefers moist, fertile soils and is often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. Its leaves are edible but contain oxalic acid, making them suitable for culinary use in moderation."
