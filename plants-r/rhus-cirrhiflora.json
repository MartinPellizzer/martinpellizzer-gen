    "intro": "Rhus cirrhiflora, commonly known as the burr oak, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern and central United States. It is characterized by its thick, fissured bark and large, lobed leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in panicles, followed by woody, spiny fruit clusters that contain one or two seeds. Its deep root system makes it highly drought-tolerant and adaptable to various soil types. Rhus cirrhiflora is often found in open woodlands and along streambanks, playing a significant role in local ecosystems."
