    "intro": "Ranunculus walo-kochii, commonly known as the Walo-Koch buttercup, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family, characterized by its showy, typically yellow or white flowers. The plant features trifoliate leaves with serrated edges and produces small, aggregate fruits that disperse its seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
