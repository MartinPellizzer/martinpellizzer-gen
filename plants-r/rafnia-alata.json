    "intro": "Rafnia alata, commonly known as the giant sycamore, is a large deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its massive trunk, thick bark, and broad, palmate leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in the spring, followed by winged fruits that disperse its seeds. Rafnia alata has a shallow root system, making it susceptible to windthrow, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
