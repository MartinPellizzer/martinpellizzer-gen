    "intro": "Rubus parviflorus var. scopulorum, commonly known as the rock raspberry, is a shrub native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its thorny stems and small, clustered white or pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces edible red berries that are similar in taste to blackberries but are often smaller and more tart. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Its botanical features make it well adapted to harsh, mountainous conditions."
