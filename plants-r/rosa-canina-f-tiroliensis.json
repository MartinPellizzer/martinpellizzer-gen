    "intro": "Rosa canina f. tiroliensis, commonly known as the Tirolean dog rose, is a botanical variant of the common dog rose. It is characterized by its smaller, more delicate flowers and slightly different growth habits compared to the typical Rosa canina. This subspecies is native to the Alpine regions of Central Europe, particularly in Austria and southern Germany. Its foliage is often more densely packed, and it produces smaller, reddish hips that mature in the autumn. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
