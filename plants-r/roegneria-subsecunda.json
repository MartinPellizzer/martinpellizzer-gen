    "intro": "Roegneria subsecunda, commonly known as the slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Asia and North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, hollow stems that often form dense mats. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue or greenish flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and covered with fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. Roegneria subsecunda is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and thrive in marginal environments."
