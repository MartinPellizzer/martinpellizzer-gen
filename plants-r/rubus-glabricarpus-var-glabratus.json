    "intro": "Rubus glabricarpus var. glabratus, commonly known as the smooth-fruited blackberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that ripen to a dark purple or black color, typically in late summer. Its flowers are white and arranged in clusters, and the plant is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. The variety is distinguished by its smooth, hairless fruiting bodies, which set it apart from other blackberry species."
