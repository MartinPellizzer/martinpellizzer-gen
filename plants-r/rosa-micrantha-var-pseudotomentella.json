    "intro": "Rosa micrantha var. pseudotomentella, commonly known as the woolly rose, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its dense, grayish-white pubescence that covers both the stems and leaves, giving it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink to white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are compound, with five to seven elliptical leaflets that are often hairy beneath. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique texture and floral display."
