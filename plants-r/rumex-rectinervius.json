    "intro": "Rumex rectinervius, commonly known as the narrow-veined sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It features distinctive leaves with a prominent central vein and a serrated margin, often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist, shaded environments. The leaves are edible, though they contain oxalic acid and should be consumed in moderation."
