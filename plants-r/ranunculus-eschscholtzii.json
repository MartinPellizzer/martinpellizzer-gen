It features showy, yellow flowers with five to nine petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and wildflower displays. Its botanical characteristics make it an important species for studying native plant ecology in the western United States."
