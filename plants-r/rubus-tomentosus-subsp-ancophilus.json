    "intro": "Rubus tomentosus subsp. ancophilus, commonly known as the hairy blackberry, is a shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and broad, lobed leaves that are covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that ripen to a dark purple or black color, typically in late summer. It thrives in moist, woodland habitats and is often found in shaded, well-drained soils. The subspecies is distinguished by its more robust growth and greater pubescence compared to other Rubus species."
