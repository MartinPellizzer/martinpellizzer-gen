It is characterized by its slender, smooth stems and trifoliate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, dark purple berries that are typically harvested in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry, rocky habitats. Its botanical features make it distinguishable from other Rubus species due to its unique stem texture and leaf morphology."
