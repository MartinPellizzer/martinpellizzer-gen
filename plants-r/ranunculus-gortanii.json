    "intro": "Ranunculus gortanii, commonly known as the Gortanii buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, palmate leaves and showy, yellow flowers with numerous stamens. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. It is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive appearance. However, like many members of the buttercup family, it contains toxic compounds and should be handled with care."
