It is characterized by its thorny stems and large, aggregate fruits that ripen to a deep purple-black color. The plant produces white or pale yellow flowers in the spring, followed by the development of its edible berries. Its leaves are typically trifoliate, with serrated edges and covered in dense glandular hairs. This species is often found in woodland edges, thickets, and disturbed soils, thriving in a variety of environmental conditions."
