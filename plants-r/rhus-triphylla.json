    "intro": "Rhus triphylla, commonly known as the three-leaved sumac, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which consist of three leaflets, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by red, fuzzy berries that are a food source for birds and wildlife. Rhus triphylla thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and stream banks. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in suitable climates."
