    "intro": "Restrepia fistulosa, commonly known as the channelled orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its intricate, tubular flowers that are typically greenish-yellow with purple or brown markings. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, enabling it to thrive in high-altitude, humid environments. It prefers cool, shaded conditions and is often found growing on rock faces or in forest understories. Its unique floral structure and adaptability to harsh climates make it a notable species within the orchid family."
