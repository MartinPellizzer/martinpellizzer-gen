    "intro": "Rosa acicularis f. pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent thorny rose, is a unique horticultural form of the prickly rose. It is characterized by its dense, glandular pubescence covering the stems and leaves, which gives it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink to white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its thorny stems and compact growth habit make it suitable for use as a decorative shrub or hedge. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental qualities and adaptability to various growing conditions."
