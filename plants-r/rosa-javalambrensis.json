    "intro": "Rosa javalambrensis, commonly known as the Javalambrensis rose, is a species native to the island of Madagascar. It is a shrub-like plant characterized by its thorny stems and dense foliage. The plant produces fragrant, pink to red flowers that bloom in clusters during the rainy season. Its leaves are typically dark green and serrated, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to the island's unique soil conditions. Rosa javalambrensis is valued for its ornamental qualities and has limited cultivation outside its native habitat."
