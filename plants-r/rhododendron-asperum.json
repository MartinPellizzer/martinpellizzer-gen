    "intro": "Rhododendron asperum, commonly known as the roughleaf rhododendron, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage that is typically a deep green with a rough, hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of tubular, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is often cultivated in horticultural settings."
