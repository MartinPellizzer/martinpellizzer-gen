It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers that are typically pink or white. It thrives in moist, tropical environments and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
