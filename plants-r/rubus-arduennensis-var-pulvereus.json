    "intro": "Rubus arduennensis var. pulvereus, commonly known as the powdered bramble, is a variant of the bramble genus Rubus native to specific regions of Europe. It is characterized by its finely hairy leaves and stems, which give it a distinctive, powdery appearance. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits known as drupes, typically reddish in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
