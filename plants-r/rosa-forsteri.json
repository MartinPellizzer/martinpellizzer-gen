    "intro": "Rosa forsteri, commonly known as the Mexican moonflower, is a species of flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring woody stems and large, fragrant white flowers that bloom at night. The flowers are usually borne on long peduncles and are notable for their strong, sweet scent, which attracts nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant produces oval, red or orange fruits that contain numerous seeds, and it is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Rosa forsteri is adapted to a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, sunny conditions."
