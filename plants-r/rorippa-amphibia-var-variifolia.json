    "intro": "Rorippa amphibia var. variifolia, commonly known as the variable watercress, is a variant of the watercress species native to moist or aquatic environments. It is characterized by its alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are typically submerged or floating. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are arranged in racemes, which bloom from the axils of the leaves. Its roots are fibrous and adapted for anchoring in water or wet soil. This variety is often found in ponds, ditches, and other freshwater habitats where it can thrive in both submerged and emergent conditions."
