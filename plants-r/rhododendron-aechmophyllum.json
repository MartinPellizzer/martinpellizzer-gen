    "intro": "Rhododendron aechmophyllum, commonly known as the alpine rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Asia, particularly in the Himalayas. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist, and well-drained soils. The plant features dense, leathery leaves and produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink and white during the spring. It is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it plays a significant role in the local ecosystem. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
