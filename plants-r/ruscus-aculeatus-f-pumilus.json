    "intro": "Ruscus aculeatus f. pumilus, commonly known as the small spurge or dwarf euonymus, is a compact, evergreen shrub characterized by its dense, low-growing habit. It features fleshy, dark green leaves that are often clustered at the ends of its branched stems. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by red, berry-like fruits, which are a feature of its botanical classification. It is native to parts of Europe and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its attractive foliage. This form is a naturally occurring variant of Ruscus aculeatus, distinguished by its smaller size and unique growth pattern."
