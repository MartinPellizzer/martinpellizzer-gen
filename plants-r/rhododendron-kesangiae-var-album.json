    "intro": "Rhododendron kesangiae var. album, commonly known as the white-flowered kesang rhododendron, is a rare and striking plant native to the eastern Himalayas. It is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that bloom in early spring, often with a faint pinkish tinge. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest habitats at high elevations. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, providing a striking contrast to its pale blossoms. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical study and conservation efforts."
