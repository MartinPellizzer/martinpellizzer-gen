    "intro": "Romulea columnae subsp. subalbida, commonly known as the alpine romulea, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit. The plant produces striking, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, with a distinctive white or pale throat. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
