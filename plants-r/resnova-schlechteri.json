    "intro": "Resnova schlechteri, commonly known as the Schlechter's resnova, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Central Africa. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from purple to deep red. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, humid climates. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, velvety texture, while its stems are woody and often branched. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Resnova schlechteri is considered a species of conservation concern."
