    "intro": "Rotantha, commonly known as the ghost plant, is a unique aquatic plant that thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments. It has slender, ribbon-like leaves that are often translucent, giving it a ghostly appearance. The plant lacks true roots and instead relies on rhizomes to anchor itself in the substrate. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically appearing in clusters near the water's surface. Rotantha is known for its ability to absorb heavy metals, making it useful in phytoremediation efforts."
