It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with dense foliage and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces hips, which are the fruiting bodies containing seeds, and these are often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, rocky environments. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological resilience in alpine habitats."
