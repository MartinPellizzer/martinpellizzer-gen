    "intro": "Rhabdotheca chondrilloides, commonly known as the rock dandelion, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its basal rosette of fleshy, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are followed by small, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in rocky soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well adapted to harsh environments. Rhabdotheca chondrilloides is often used in traditional medicine and is valued for its resilience in difficult conditions."
