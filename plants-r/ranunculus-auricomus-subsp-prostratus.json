    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus subsp. prostratus, commonly known as the prostrate buttercup, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a basal rosette of heart-shaped, bright yellow flowers with numerous stamens and a distinctive yellow center. The leaves are palmately divided and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its often arid habitat. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks. This subspecies is noted for its ornamental value and is cultivated in gardens for its attractive, daisy-like blooms."
