    "intro": "Rhabdotheca, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a unique genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Euphorbiaceae. It is characterized by its striking, colorful bracts that resemble flowers, although they are actually modified leaves. The plant is native to tropical regions of Africa and is often found in sandy or rocky soils. Rhabdotheca species typically produce small, inconspicuous true flowers surrounded by the showy bracts. These plants are often cultivated for their ornamental value due to their vibrant and unusual appearance."
