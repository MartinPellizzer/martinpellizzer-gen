    "intro": "Rhynchospora nervosa, commonly known as the veined flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy habitats in the Americas. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically inconspicuous and arranged in spikelets. Rhynchospora nervosa is often found in shallow water or moist soils, contributing to the ecological diversity of wetland ecosystems. Its presence is an indicator of healthy, undisturbed wetland environments."
