    "intro": "Rhodax rupifragus, commonly known as the rock rose, is a hardy perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing form and produces clusters of pink or white flowers in early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Rhodax rupifragus is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in harsh environments."
