    "intro": "Ruehssia estebanensis, commonly known as the Esteban's ruehssia, is a flowering plant native to the Andean region of South America. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as cloud forests, where it thrives in cooler temperatures. Its leaves are usually elliptical with a smooth texture, and the flowers are often white or pale yellow. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare species with potential ecological significance in its native ecosystem."
