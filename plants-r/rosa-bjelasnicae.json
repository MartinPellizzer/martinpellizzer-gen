    "intro": "Rosa bjelasnicae, commonly known as the Bjelasnica rose, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Bosnia and Herzegovina. It is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit, with thorny stems and dense foliage. The plant produces showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets, and it thrives in well-drained, acidic soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Rosa bjelasnicae is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
