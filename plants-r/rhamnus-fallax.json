    "intro": "Rhamnus fallax, commonly known as the Mexican buckthorn, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its narrow, upright growth habit and dark green, leathery leaves that remain throughout the winter. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, which are followed by dark blue-black berries in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it adaptable to various environmental conditions. The berries are an important food source for birds and other wildlife."
