It is characterized by its dense, thorny growth habit and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically clustered in groups of three. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Due to its unique fruiting pattern, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
