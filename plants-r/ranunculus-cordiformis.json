    "intro": "Ranunculus cordiformis, commonly known as the heart-shaped buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features delicate, palmate leaves that are distinctly heart-shaped, often with a waxy coating. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with five petal-like sepals, which are typically borne on slender stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, streambanks, and woodland edges. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens but can be invasive in some regions."
