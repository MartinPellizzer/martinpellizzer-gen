    "intro": "Rosa inodora var. minor, commonly known as the miniature sweet briar rose, is a compact, shrub-like plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It features small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has thorny stems and dark green, serrated leaves that provide a dense, ornamental structure. It is well-suited for rock gardens or as a border plant due to its compact size and hardy nature. Rosa inodora var. minor is also valued for its historical use in perfumery and as a source of ornamental cut flowers."
