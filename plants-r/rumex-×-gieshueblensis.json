    "intro": "Rumex \u00d7 gieshueblensis, commonly known as the hybrid sorrel, is a naturally occurring hybrid between Rumex acetosa (common sorrel) and Rumex acetobatus (water sorrel). It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are typically reddish underneath, and it produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters. This plant is often found in moist, disturbed soils along stream banks and in wet meadows. It is a perennial herb that spreads through rhizomes and is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions. The plant contains oxalic acid, which can be toxic in large quantities, making it potentially harmful to livestock and humans."
