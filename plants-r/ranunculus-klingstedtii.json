    "intro": "Ranunculus klingstedtii, commonly known as the Klingstedt's buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a basal rosette of lance-shaped, hairy leaves and produces showy yellow flowers with five to eight sepals that resemble petals. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. It is characterized by its delicate appearance and is often found in high-altitude meadows. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
