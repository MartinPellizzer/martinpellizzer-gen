    "intro": "Rubus persanimontis var. microphyllus, commonly known as the small-leaved blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, dark green leaves that are densely arranged along the stems. The flowers are typically white or pale pink, and the fruit is a small, dark purple to black berry. This variety is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Its botanical features make it distinct from other Rubus species, particularly in leaf size and fruit morphology."
