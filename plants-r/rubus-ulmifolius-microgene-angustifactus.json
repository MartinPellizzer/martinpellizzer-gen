    "intro": "Rubus ulmifolius microgene angustifactus, commonly known as the narrow-leafed blackberry, is a variant of the common blackberry species. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically narrower than those of the standard Rubus ulmifolius. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are usually smaller than the typical blackberry fruits. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils. This subspecies is valued for its unique foliage and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes."
