    "intro": "Ranunculus palustris, commonly known as the marsh buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland habitats in North America. It features slender, hairy stems that rise from a rhizomatous root system, often growing in shallow water or moist soil. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with five to nine petals, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are deeply lobed and arranged alternately along the stem, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Ranunculus palustris plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and nectar for various pollinators."
