    "intro": "Rosa mutica, commonly known as the climbing rose or wild rose, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the branches. The plant produces fragrant, pink to red flowers in the summer months, which are followed by orange or red hips containing seeds. Rosa mutica is often found in woodland edges, hedgerows, and other disturbed habitats due to its adaptability. Its botanical features make it an important species for both ecological and ornamental purposes."
