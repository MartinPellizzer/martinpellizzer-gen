    "intro": "Rubus istricus, commonly known as the Istrian blackberry, is a species of brambles native to the Balkan Peninsula. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, dark red berries that are typically harvested in late summer. It thrives in woodland edges and rocky soils, preferring temperate climates. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its native range."
