    "intro": "Rosa parviuscula, commonly known as the small-flowered rose, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically produces pink to white petals and has a thorny stem covered in fine hairs. Rosa parviuscula is often found in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soil. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in cooler climates."
