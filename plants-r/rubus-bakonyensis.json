    "intro": "Rubus bakonyensis, commonly known as the Bakony blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the Carpathian Basin. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, dark red to black berries. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and shrublands. Its leaves are compound, with three to five leaflets, and are covered in fine hairs. The berries are edible, though they are often tart and require sugar to balance their flavor."
