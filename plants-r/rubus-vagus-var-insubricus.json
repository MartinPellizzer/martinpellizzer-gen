    "intro": "Rubus vagus var. insubricus, commonly known as the alpine raspberry, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and hairy stems, which help it withstand harsh alpine conditions. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or yellow in color, containing several drupelets. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it blooms with white or pale yellow flowers in early summer. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rocky or well-drained garden soils."
