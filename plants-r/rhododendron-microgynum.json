    "intro": "Rhododendron microgynum, commonly known as the dwarf rhododendron, is a compact evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It features dense, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and glossy, providing a striking visual contrast to its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The flowers are usually pink to reddish in color and bloom in early spring, adding vibrant color to woodland gardens. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and shaded borders. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is often cultivated in horticultural settings."
