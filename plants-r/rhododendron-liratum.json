It is characterized by its lance-shaped, silver-veined leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, funnel-shaped flowers in shades of white to pink, typically blooming in late spring. It prefers acidic, well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight. Rhododendron liratum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and delicate floral display."
