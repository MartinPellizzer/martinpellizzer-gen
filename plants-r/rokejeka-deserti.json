It is characterized by its compact, succulent-like structure and produces showy, daisy-like flowers in shades of yellow and white. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through its thick, fleshy leaves that store water. Its flowering period typically occurs during the rainy season, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Rokejeka deserti is often found in rocky soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal in xeriscaping."
