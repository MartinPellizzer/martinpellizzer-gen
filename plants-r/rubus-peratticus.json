    "intro": "Rubus peratticus, commonly known as the alpine blackberry, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, dark red berries that are typically edible and have a tart flavor. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value and as a source of wild berries."
