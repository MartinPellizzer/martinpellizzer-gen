It is characterized by its slender, cuneate (wedge-shaped) leaves and small, dark purple to black fruits. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and thrives in rich, well-drained soils. Its thorny stems and aggregate fruits are typical of the Rubus genus. This variety is often found in the understory of deciduous forests, where it contributes to local biodiversity."
