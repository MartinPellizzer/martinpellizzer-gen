    "intro": "Rubus fruticosus foliis-variegatis, commonly known as the variegated bramble, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves that display a striking variegation of green, white, and sometimes yellow. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers in the spring, followed by red berries in the fall. Its foliage is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value, though it can be invasive in some regions. The species is closely related to other raspberries and blackberries in the Rubus genus."
