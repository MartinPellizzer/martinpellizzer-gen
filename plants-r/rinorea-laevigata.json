    "intro": "Rinorea laevigata, commonly known as the velvetleaf or silverleaf, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating, giving it a velvety appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are typically clustered in the axils of the leaves. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that release tiny seeds when mature. Rinorea laevigata is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and stream banks."
