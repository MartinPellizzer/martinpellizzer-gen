It features small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has a sprawling growth habit with multiple stems and is characterized by its dense, thorny foliage. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant.
