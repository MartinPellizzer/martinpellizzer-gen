    "intro": "Rosa villosa f. glabrescens, commonly known as the glabrous rose, is a cultivated form of the shrub rose characterized by its smooth, hairless stems and foliage. It typically produces clusters of fragrant, pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is deciduous, shedding its leaves in autumn, and thrives in well-drained soil with full sun exposure. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in gardens for its beauty and hardiness. This variety is a popular choice for landscaping due to its compact growth habit and disease resistance."
