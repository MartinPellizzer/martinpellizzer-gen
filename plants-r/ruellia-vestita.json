It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety pubescence, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple, typically blooming in the summer months. Ruellia vestita is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and along stream banks. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
