    "intro": "Ranunculus landsorticola, commonly known as the alpine buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, palmately divided leaves and showy yellow flowers with a distinctive central blotch. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. It produces small, green fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
