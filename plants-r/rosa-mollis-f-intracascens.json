    "intro": "Rosa mollis f. intracascens, commonly known as the creeping rose, is a compact, low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of South America. It features dense, thornless stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to form mats or small colonies. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink to white, typically blooming in spring. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets with a soft, velvety texture. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to rocky or well-drained soils."
