    "intro": "Rumex acetosella, commonly known as sorrel, is a low-growing perennial plant characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and red-stemmed flowers. It is a member of the Polygonaceae family and is often found in moist, acidic soils in woodland areas. The leaves are edible and have a tangy, sour flavor due to the presence of oxalic acid. It thrives in temperate climates and is often used in traditional herbal medicine. The plant is also known for its ability to accumulate heavy metals, making it useful in phytoremediation efforts."
