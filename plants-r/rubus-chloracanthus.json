    "intro": "Rubus chloracanthus, commonly known as the green-stemmed blackberry, is a species of bramble native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically green with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are usually dark purple to black when mature. Its stems are distinctive for their green coloration, which sets it apart from other Rubus species. It thrives in moist, wooded areas and is often found in the understory of deciduous forests."
