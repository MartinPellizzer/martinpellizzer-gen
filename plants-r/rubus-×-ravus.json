    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 ravus, commonly known as the blackberry raspberry hybrid, is a deciduous shrub belonging to the Rosaceae family. It is a naturally occurring hybrid between blackberries (Rubus fruticosus) and raspberries (Rubus idaeus), resulting in a plant that exhibits traits of both parent species. The plant produces compound leaves with serrated edges and develops red or black fruits that are typically hairy and have a distinctive aroma. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, and it thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil. This hybrid is valued for its fruit quality and is often cultivated for both commercial and home garden purposes."
