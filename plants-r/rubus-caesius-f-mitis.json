    "intro": "Rubus caesius f. mitis, commonly known as the soft-stemmed blackberry, is a botanical variant of the blackberry plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its softer, more flexible stems compared to the typical blackberry species. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically smaller than those of the standard Rubus caesius. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas. The foliage is usually a deep green, with serrated leaf margins, contributing to its ornamental value."
