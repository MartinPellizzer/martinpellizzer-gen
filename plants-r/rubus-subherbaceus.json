    "intro": "Rubus subherbaceus, commonly known as the creeping blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the western United States. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are edible but often have a tart flavor. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the stems are covered in fine, persistent hairs. The plant plays an important ecological role by providing food for birds and small mammals."
