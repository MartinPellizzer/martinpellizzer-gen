    "intro": "Ranunculus carpetanus var. alpinus, commonly known as the alpine buttercup, is a flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of the Alps and other mountainous areas. It is a perennial herb with a compact, mat-like growth habit, often forming dense carpets on rocky or alpine slopes. The plant produces showy yellow flowers with five to nine petals, typically blooming in early summer. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three deeply lobed leaflets, and are covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments."
