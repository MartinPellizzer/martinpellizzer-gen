    "intro": "Rubus iceniensis, commonly known as the Norfolk hillberry, is a species of bramble native to the United Kingdom. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers in late spring, followed by red berries in the autumn. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodland edges and heathland. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
