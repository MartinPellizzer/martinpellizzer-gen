    "intro": "Rosa grypotacta, commonly known as the golden-leaf rose, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, where it thrives in cool, temperate climates. The plant is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range in color from white to deep pink, often with a golden hue at the base. Its leaves are broad and serrated, providing a striking contrast to the vibrant blooms. Rosa grypotacta is valued for both its ornamental beauty and its historical use in traditional medicine."
