    "intro": "Rosa hecleliana, commonly known as the Huckleberry rose, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and thorny stems, which help it thrive in rugged environments. The plant produces fragrant, semi-double flowers in shades of pink to red, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are dark green, leathery, and arranged alternately along the stems. Rosa hecleliana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in gardens for its hardiness and adaptability to various soil conditions."
