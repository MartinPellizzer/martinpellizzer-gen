    "intro": "Rosa arvensis proles repens, commonly known as the creeping woodsrose, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with stems that spread along the ground and root at the nodes. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink to white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are compound, consisting of five to seven oval-shaped leaflets, and it is often found in disturbed soils such as roadsides and meadows. Rosa arvensis proles repens is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
