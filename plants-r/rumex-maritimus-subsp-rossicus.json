    "intro": "Rumex maritimus subsp. rossicus, commonly known as sea sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in saline soils along shores, dunes, and rocky coastlines, adapting to harsh environmental conditions. The plant features alternate, pinnately lobed leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Its flowers are small and clustered in dense, terminal spikes, with both male and female flowers present on the same inflorescence. The species is valued for its edible leaves, which are rich in vitamin C and have a tart, lemony flavor."
