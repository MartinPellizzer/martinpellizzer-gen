    "intro": "Roegneria altaica, commonly known as the Altai wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, which are wind-pollinated. Roegneria altaica is adapted to cold and arid environments, often growing at high altitudes. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
