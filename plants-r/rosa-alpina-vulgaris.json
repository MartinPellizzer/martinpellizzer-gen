    "intro": "Rosa alpina vulgaris, commonly known as the alpine rose, is a species of flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is a low-growing shrub that typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters, with woody stems and dense, dark green foliage. The plant produces fragrant, pink or white flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in terminal corymbs. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and covered in fine hairs, adapted to withstand cold and harsh alpine conditions. Rosa alpina vulgaris is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens or alpine settings."
