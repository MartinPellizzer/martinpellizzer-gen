    "intro": "Rubus subnudus, commonly known as the smooth bramble, is a shrub native to western North America. It is characterized by its slender, thornless stems and small, trifoliate leaves. The plant produces white to pale pink flowers in late spring, which are followed by red, edible berries. It thrives in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
