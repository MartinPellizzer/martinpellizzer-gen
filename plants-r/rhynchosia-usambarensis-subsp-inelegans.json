    "intro": "Rhynchosia usambarensis subsp. inelegans, commonly known as the African butterbean, is a leguminous plant native to eastern Africa. It is characterized by its climbing habit and trifoliate leaves with a pubescent surface. The flowers are typically yellow or orange, with a distinctive spurred petal, and the pods are slender and contain several seeds. This species is valued for its edible seeds, which are rich in protein and used in local cuisines. It also plays a role in soil nitrogen fixation due to its association with rhizobia."
