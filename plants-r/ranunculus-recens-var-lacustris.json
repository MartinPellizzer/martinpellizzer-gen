It typically grows in shallow water or along the edges of ponds and lakes, with its leaves divided into fine, thread-like segments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with five petals, often accompanied by numerous stamens. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize the soil in aquatic environments. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and fish."
