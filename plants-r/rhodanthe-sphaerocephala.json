It belongs to the daisy family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its spherical, yellow flower heads that resemble small globes. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to dry, sunny conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Rhodanthe sphaerocephala is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
