    "intro": "Rosa lucandiana, commonly known as the Mexican rose or the everblooming rose, is a species native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring thorny stems and dense foliage. The plant produces showy, single or double flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, often with a strong, sweet fragrance. Its leaves are dark green, glossy, and arranged in odd-pinnate patterns, contributing to its ornamental value. Rosa lucandiana is valued for its hardiness and ability to bloom continuously throughout the growing season."
