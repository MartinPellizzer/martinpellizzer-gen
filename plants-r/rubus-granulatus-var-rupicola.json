It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black in color. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in high-altitude environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated for its edible berries and ornamental value."
