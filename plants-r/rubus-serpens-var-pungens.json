    "intro": "Rubus serpens var. pungens, commonly known as the spiny blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a trailing shrub characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black when mature. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its botanical features make it distinct from other Rubus species, particularly in its dense thorn coverage and fruit structure."
