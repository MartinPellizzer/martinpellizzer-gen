    "intro": "Ritchiea mayumbensis, commonly known as the Mayumb\u00e9 cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the tropical rainforests of Central Africa. It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of pinnate, feather-like leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Ritchiea mayumbensis is considered critically endangered, making conservation efforts essential for its survival."
