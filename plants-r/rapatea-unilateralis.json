    "intro": "Rapatea unilateralis, commonly known as the single-leaf cycad, is a unique cycad species native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its singular, large, compound leaf that can grow up to 3 meters in length. The plant has a short, thick trunk and produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to the specific ecological conditions of its native habitat. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species."
