    "intro": "Rhododendron fulvastrum subsp. trichophlebium, commonly known as the yellow-leaved rhododendron, is a subtropical evergreen shrub characterized by its leathery, ovate to elliptical leaves that are typically yellow-green to reddish in color. The flowers are showy, appearing in clusters of 2\u20136, with petals that are pink to reddish in hue, often with a yellow or white base. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. The plant is native to the mountainous regions of southern China and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in the wild."
