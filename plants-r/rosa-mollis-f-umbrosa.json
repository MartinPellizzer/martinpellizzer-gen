    "intro": "Rosa mollis f. umbrosa, commonly known as the shade-loving rose, is a compact shrub that thrives in partially shaded environments. It features dark green, velvety foliage that is dense and often covered in a fine, soft down. The flowers are typically pink to red, with a delicate fragrance, and bloom in late spring to early summer. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and adaptability to cooler, moist conditions. It is often used in woodland gardens or as a groundcover in shaded areas."
