    "intro": "Rotala heterophylla, commonly known as the water lettuce or water thyme, is a floating aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It has finely divided, feather-like leaves that provide shade and oxygen to aquatic environments. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom above the water surface. Rotala heterophylla is often used in ponds and water gardens for its ornamental value and ability to control algae growth. It thrives in shallow, still waters with moderate to high light exposure."
