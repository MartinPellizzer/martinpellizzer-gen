    "intro": "Ranunculus leslieanus, commonly known as Leslie's buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It features showy, yellow flowers with five petals and a central cluster of stamens, typical of the Ranunculaceae family. The plant has palmately divided leaves that are deeply lobed, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
