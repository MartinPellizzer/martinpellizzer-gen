    "intro": "Rubus arenicola var. confictus, commonly known as the sand raspberry, is a shrub native to arid and rocky habitats in the southwestern United States. It has slender, thorned stems that grow close to the ground, often forming dense mats. The plant produces small, red fruits that are typically edible and have a tart flavor. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it thrives in well-drained soils. This species is adapted to harsh environments and plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils through its extensive root system."
