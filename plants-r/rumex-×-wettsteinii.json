    "intro": "Rumex \u00d7 wettsteinii, commonly known as the hybrid sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Polygonaceae family. It is a natural hybrid between Rumex acetosa (sourgrass) and Rumex acetvergicus (broadleaf dock), resulting in a plant with distinctive leaf morphology. The leaves are typically heart-shaped with a wavy margin and a reddish or purple underside, which can vary depending on environmental conditions. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in wetlands, meadows, and along streambanks. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in dense clusters, and its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its spread in suitable habitats."
