It features slender, arching stems with dark green, ovate leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery-white down. The plant produces clusters of pale pink to white flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its foliage remains evergreen throughout the year, providing year-round visual interest. This variety is well adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats."
