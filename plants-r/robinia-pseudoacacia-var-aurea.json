    "intro": "Robinia pseudoacacia var. aurea, commonly known as the golden robinia, is a variant of the false acacia tree characterized by its striking yellow foliage. This deciduous tree features compound leaves that turn a brilliant golden color in the autumn, adding ornamental value to landscapes. It produces fragrant, pale yellow flowers in late spring, which are followed by elongated, flat pods. The tree is native to the southeastern United States but is widely cultivated in temperate regions for its aesthetic appeal. It is relatively drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils."
