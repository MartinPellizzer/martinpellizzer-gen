    "intro": "Rubus dumetorum f. brachyadenus, commonly known as the short-styled blackberry, is a variant of the common blackberry species. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and smaller, more densely packed leaves compared to the typical form. The flowers are usually pale pink to white, with short, broad sepals. The fruit is a dark purple to black aggregate berry, typically smaller than the standard blackberry. This subspecies is often found in rocky or disturbed soils in temperate regions."
