    "intro": "Rhododendron lampropeplum, commonly known as the silver-leaf rhododendron, is a species native to the Himalayas, particularly in regions of India and Nepal. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage that exhibits a striking silvery-gray hue on the underside of the leaves. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in mountainous forest habitats. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for horticultural cultivation in suitable environments."
