It is characterized by its tall, jointed stems and whorled arrangement of leaves, which are typically dark green and narrow. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the top of its stem, a feature typical of fern allies. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in temperate regions. Its ancient lineage dates back to the Carboniferous period, making it a living fossil with significant botanical interest."
