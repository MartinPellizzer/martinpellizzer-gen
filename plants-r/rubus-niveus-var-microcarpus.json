    "intro": "Rubus niveus var. microcarpus, commonly known as the dwarf white bramble, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features slender, thorny stems that grow close to the ground, often forming dense mats. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers in early summer, followed by small, edible berries that are typically less than 5 mm in diameter. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three oval-shaped leaflets that have a slightly serrated edge. This species is adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cooler, high-altitude environments."
