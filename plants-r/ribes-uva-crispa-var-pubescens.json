    "intro": "Ribes uva-crispa var. pubescens, commonly known as the downy currant, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, five-lobed leaves that are covered in fine pubescence, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-white flowers in early summer, which are followed by small, edible berries. These berries are typically red or purple when ripe and are used in jams and wines. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or hedgerows."
