    "intro": "Rubus trigonus, commonly known as the three-angled blackberry, is a species of brambles native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its thorny stems and trifoliate leaves, which are divided into three leaflets. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple or black when mature. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The berries are edible but have a tart flavor, making them suitable for jams and wines."
