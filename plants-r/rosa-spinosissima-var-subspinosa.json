    "intro": "Rosa spinosissima var. subspinosa, commonly known as the prickly rose, is a variant of the spinous rose characterized by its dense, thorny stems and dark green, slightly serrated leaves. It produces fragrant, pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in well-drained soil with full sun exposure. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and hardy nature in temperate climates."
