It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds, streams, and marshes. The plant has thin, branching stems that help it float or remain submerged, supporting its aquatic lifestyle. Its leaves are usually divided into fine segments, enhancing its ability to absorb sunlight and nutrients from the water. This variety is notable for its role in aquatic ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
