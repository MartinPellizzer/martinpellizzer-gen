    "intro": "Racosperma imparile, commonly known as the unequal racosperma, is a shrub native to Australia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. It has small, elongated pods that contain several seeds, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Racosperma imparile is often found in coastal and inland regions of southern Australia."
