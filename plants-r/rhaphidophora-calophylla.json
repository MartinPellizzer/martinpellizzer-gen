    "intro": "Rhaphidophora calophylla, commonly known as the Calophylla Zamioculcas, is a tropical evergreen plant native to eastern Africa. It belongs to the Araceae family and is characterized by its glossy, waxy leaves that are typically dark green with a prominent midrib. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are surrounded by a spathe, a modified leaf-like structure. It is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant due to its attractive foliage and low maintenance requirements. Rhaphidophora calophylla thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers well-draining soil with moderate watering."
