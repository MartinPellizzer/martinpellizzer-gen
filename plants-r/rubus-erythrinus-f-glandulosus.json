    "intro": "Rubus erythrinus f. glandulosus, commonly known as the glandular raspberry, is a variant of the red raspberry plant characterized by its distinctive glandular structures on the stems and leaves. This subspecies is native to parts of Europe and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils. Its leaves are typically trifoliate, with serrated margins, and the flowers are usually pink to white in color. The fruits, which are aggregate berries, are edible and have a tart flavor, making them popular in culinary uses. The plant's glandular features contribute to its unique appearance and may play a role in its ecological interactions."
