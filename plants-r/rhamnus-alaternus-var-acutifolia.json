    "intro": "Rhamnus alaternus var. acutifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved buckthorn, is a shrub native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It features dark green, lance-shaped leaves that are typically narrow and pointed, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by black, egg-shaped berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or dry habitats. This species is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in ornamental gardening."
