    "intro": "Rubus colemannii microgene sparsus, commonly known as the sparse microgene raspberry, is a rare and little-known species within the Rubus genus. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers and bristly foliage, typical of many Rubus species. The plant is native to specific regions of Mexico, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its fruit, though not widely cultivated, is edible and has a tart flavor. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a botanically significant but endangered species."
