    "intro": "Rumex salicifolius, commonly known as broadleaf sorrel, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features alternate, broadly ovate to rhombic leaves that are often reddish or purple-veined, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by triangular, beak-like fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its leaves are edible but contain oxalic acid, so they should be consumed in moderation."
