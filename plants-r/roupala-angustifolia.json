    "intro": "Roupala angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf roupala, is a deciduous tree native to the tropical and subtropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Proteaceae and is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stems. The tree produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Its bark is smooth and grayish in color, and it often grows in lowland forests or along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
