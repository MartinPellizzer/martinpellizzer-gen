    "intro": "Roldana greenmanii, commonly known as the greenman's roldana, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces showy, yellow-orange inflorescences that bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Roldana greenmanii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
