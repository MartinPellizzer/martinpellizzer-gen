    "intro": "Rosa canina var. biserrata, commonly known as the prickly rose or dog rose, is a variant of the dog rose species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, fragrant pink or white flowers. The plant produces red, hairy fruits called hips, which are rich in vitamin C and used in traditional medicine. Its leaves are pinnate, with serrated edges that give it the \"biserrata\" designation, meaning \"double-toothed.\" This species is often found in hedgerows and woodlands, thriving in well-drained soils."
