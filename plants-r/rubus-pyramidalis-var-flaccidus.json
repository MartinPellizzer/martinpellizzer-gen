    "intro": "Rubus pyramidalis var. flaccidus, commonly known as the flaccid blackberry, is a variant of the pyramidal blackberry species native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and small, dark purple to black berries that ripen in late summer. The plant produces trifoliate leaves with serrated edges and has thorny stems typical of the Rubus genus. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in moist, shaded environments. The berries are edible but are generally less flavorful compared to other blackberry varieties."
