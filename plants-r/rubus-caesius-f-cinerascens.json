    "intro": "Rubus caesius f. cinerascens, commonly known as the ash-colored raspberry, is a variant of the red raspberry species. It is characterized by its pale, ash-gray stems and leaves, which distinguish it from the typical red raspberry. The plant produces small, usually red or pink berries that are edible but less commonly cultivated than other raspberry varieties. It thrives in temperate climates and prefers well-drained soil. This form is often found in wild populations and is valued for its ornamental qualities as well as its fruit."
