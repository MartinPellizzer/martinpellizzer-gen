    "intro": "Ribes \u00d7 fontenayense, commonly known as the hybrid gooseberry, is a deciduous shrub that belongs to the genus Ribes in the family Grossulariaceae. It is a natural hybrid between Ribes nigrum (black currant) and Ribes rubrum (red currant), resulting in a plant with distinctive horticultural traits. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptic, with serrated edges and a dark green upper surface. Its small, aggregate fruits are usually red or yellow, ripening in late summer, and are edible, though often tart. This plant is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and potential for culinary use."
