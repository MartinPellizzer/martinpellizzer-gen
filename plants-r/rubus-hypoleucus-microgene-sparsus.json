    "intro": "Rubus hypoleucus microgene sparsus, commonly known as the alpine raspberry, is a species of bramble native to high-altitude regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, thorny stems and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in late summer. The plant produces small, red or orange berries that are edible but often have a tart flavor. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in alpine ecosystems."
