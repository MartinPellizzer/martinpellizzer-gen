    "intro": "Ranunculus oxyspermus var. oxyspermus, commonly known as the sharp-scented buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows to a height of 15\u201330 cm, featuring basal leaves that are deeply lobed and hairy. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with five petals, often accompanied by 5\u201315 stamens. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
