It is characterized by its thorny stems and small, usually pink or white flowers. The leaves are typically trifoliate, with serrated margins, and the plant produces rose hips that are oval and often reddish in color. This variety is often found in disturbed soils and thrives in full sun, making it a common weed in agricultural areas. Its botanical features make it an important species for both ecological studies and horticultural research."
