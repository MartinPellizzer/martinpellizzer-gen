It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly rough texture. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grassy areas or along stream banks. Due to its medicinal properties, it has been traditionally used in local herbal remedies."
