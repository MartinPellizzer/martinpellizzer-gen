It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, with its bright yellow flowers often floating on the water surface. The plant has finely divided, arrow-shaped leaves that help it thrive in aquatic environments. Its flowers are usually short-lived, opening in the morning and closing by midday. This variety is notable for its adaptability to wetland habitats and its ornamental value in water gardens."
