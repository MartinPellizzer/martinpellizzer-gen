    "intro": "Rumex vinealis, commonly known as sourdock, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Polygonaceae family. It is characterized by its upright, often branched stems that are covered in fine, sticky hairs. The leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and have a distinctive sour taste due to the presence of oxalic acid. It produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, which are followed by triangular, winged fruits. This plant is typically found in disturbed soils and is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
