It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, followed by elongated, woody fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in rainforest understories. The leaves are used in traditional medicine for their purported antifungal and antiseptic properties."
