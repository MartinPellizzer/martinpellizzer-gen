    "intro": "Rotheca hexangularis, commonly known as the six-angled rotheca, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive hexagonal-shaped leaves, which give it its scientific name. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Rotheca hexangularis is a valuable plant for ecological studies due to its unique morphology and habitat preferences."
