    "intro": "Rubus rusticanus subsp. insignitus, commonly known as the alpine raspberry, is a shrub native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its slender stems and small, aggregated flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces edible berries that are typically red or yellow in color, though they are less commonly consumed than other raspberry species. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, temperate climates. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
