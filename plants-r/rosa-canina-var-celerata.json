    "intro": "Rosa canina var. celerata, commonly known as the fast-growing dog rose, is a variant of the common dog rose. It is characterized by its rapid growth rate compared to the standard Rosa canina. The plant produces pink to red flowers that bloom in spring, followed by orange-red hips. It has thorny stems and pinnate leaves with five to seven leaflets. This variety is often used in hedgerows and as a decorative plant due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
