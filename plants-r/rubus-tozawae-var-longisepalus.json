It is characterized by its dark purple to black berries, which are typically larger than those of the standard Rubus tozawae. The plant produces compound leaves with serrated edges and has thorny stems typical of the Rubus genus. Its flowers are white and clustered in umbels, and the fruit develops from the fertilized flower buds. This variety is valued for its unique flavor and is often cultivated for both ornamental and culinary purposes."
