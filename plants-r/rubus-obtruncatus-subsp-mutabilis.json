    "intro": "Rubus obtruncatus subsp. mutabilis, commonly known as the variable blackberry, is a species of bramble native to parts of North America. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and the production of edible, dark purple to black berries. The plant has trifoliate leaves with serrated edges and produces white to pale pink flowers in the spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and thickets. Due to its variable morphology, it can be challenging to distinguish from other Rubus species in the wild."
