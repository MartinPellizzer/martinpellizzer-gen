    "intro": "Rhododendron fuchsioides, commonly known as the pink azalea, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and showy, clustered flowers that range from pink to lavender in color. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing abundant nectar that attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It prefers well-drained, acidic soils and partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for cultivation in temperate climates. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and long-lasting floral display."
