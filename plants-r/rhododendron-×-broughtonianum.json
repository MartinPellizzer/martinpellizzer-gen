    "intro": "Rhododendron \u00d7 broughtonianum, commonly known as the Broughton's rhododendron, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Rhododendron catawbiense and Rhododendron maximum. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. The plant is evergreen, with thick, dark green leaves that provide a striking contrast to its vibrant blooms. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to form compact, shrub-like growths that are both hardy and long-lasting."
