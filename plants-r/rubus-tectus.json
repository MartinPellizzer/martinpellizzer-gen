    "intro": "Rubus tectus, commonly known as the rough blackberry, is a species of brambles native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, dark berries that are typically consumed by birds and other wildlife. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in hedgerows, woodland edges, and along roadsides. Due to its hardy nature, it is often considered an invasive species in some regions."
