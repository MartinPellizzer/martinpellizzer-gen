    "intro": "Ranunculus micranthus var. delitescens, commonly known as the pale buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It features delicate, yellow flowers with five sepals that resemble petals, typically blooming in early spring. The plant has a basal rosette of trifoliate leaves, which are finely divided and covered in a soft, woolly coating. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in some regions."
