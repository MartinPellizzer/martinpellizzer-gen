    "intro": "Rubus odoratus var. deliciosus, commonly known as the sweet-scented raspberry, is a variant of the raspberry plant native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its clusters of small, bright red berries that are both aromatic and flavorful. The plant produces fragrant white flowers in the spring, which give way to the edible fruits in summer. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the stems are typically covered in fine, silvery hairs. This variety is often cultivated for its culinary uses and ornamental value in gardens."
