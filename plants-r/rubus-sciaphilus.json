    "intro": "Rubus sciaphilus, commonly known as the shade raspberry, is a species of bramble native to the forests of eastern North America. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or black in color. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found beneath the canopy of deciduous forests. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it produces white flowers in the spring. The berries are edible but generally less flavorful compared to other Rubus species."
