It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are covered in a rough, textured surface. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the warmer months. Its woody stems are aromatic and have been traditionally used in herbal remedies. Rumea coriacea is adapted to thrive in tropical and subtropical climates with well-drained soil."
