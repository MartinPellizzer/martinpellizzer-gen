    "intro": "Rigiolepis lancifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rigiolepis, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features slender, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the cooler months. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping in arid regions."
