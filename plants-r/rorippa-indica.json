    "intro": "Rorippa indica, commonly known as watercress, is a flowering plant in the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its alternate, broadly ovate leaves that are often submerged or floating in aquatic environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are typically arranged in racemes. Its roots are fibrous and adapted for nutrient absorption from water, while its stems are flexible and buoyant. Rorippa indica is often found in ponds, ditches, and other freshwater habitats, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
