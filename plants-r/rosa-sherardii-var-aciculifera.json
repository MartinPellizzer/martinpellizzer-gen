    "intro": "Rosa sherardii var. aciculifera, commonly known as the acicular rose, is a rare and unique variant of the shrub rose. It is characterized by its slender, needle-like leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white, typically blooming in late spring. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
