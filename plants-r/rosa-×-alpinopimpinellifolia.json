    "intro": "Rosa \u00d7 alpinopimpinellifolia, commonly known as the alpine meadow rose, is a hybrid shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense, dark green foliage. The plant produces showy, single or double flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with similar conditions."
