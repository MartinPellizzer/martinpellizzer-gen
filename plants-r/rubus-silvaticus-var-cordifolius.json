It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are heart-shaped and often have a velvety texture. The plant produces small, dark purple berries that are typically less showy than other blackberry varieties. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and thickets. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and traditional herbal use."
