    "intro": "Rumex acetosella var. subintegrifolius, commonly known as lesser sorrel, is a low-growing perennial herb native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features slender, ascending stems covered in fine, glandular hairs, and its leaves are alternate, ovate to elliptic in shape with a smooth or slightly toothed margin. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in dense clusters, typically in early spring, which are followed by triangular, winged fruits. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wet meadows, bogs, and along stream banks. This variety is distinguished by its more integrifolious (entire-edged) leaf morphology compared to the typical species."
