    "intro": "Rourea verruculosa, commonly known as the rough-leaf rourea, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its woody stems and thick, leathery leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy, rough texture, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Rourea verruculosa is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique foliage."
