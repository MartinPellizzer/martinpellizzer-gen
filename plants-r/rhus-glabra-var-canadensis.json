The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in panicles, followed by clusters of red, fuzzy fruits that are a common food source for birds. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is adaptable to a variety of soil types. Smooth sumac is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
