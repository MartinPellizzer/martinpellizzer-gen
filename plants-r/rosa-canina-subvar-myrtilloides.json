    "intro": "Rosa canina subvar. myrtilloides, commonly known as the blackthorn rose, is a shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dark, thorny stems and small, oval leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces clusters of white or pink flowers in early spring, which are followed by dark blue, berry-like fruits called drupes. These fruits are edible but have a tart, astringent flavor. The plant is often found in hedgerows and woodland edges, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
