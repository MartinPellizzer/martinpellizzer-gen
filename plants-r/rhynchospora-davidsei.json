It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and rushes, and is characterized by its triangular stems and dense, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often in marshes or along the edges of ponds. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, with three stamens and a single pistil, and it relies on wind pollination.
