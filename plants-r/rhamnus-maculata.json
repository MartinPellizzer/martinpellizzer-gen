    "intro": "Rhamnus maculata, commonly known as the spotted buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It features compound leaves with oval-shaped leaflets that have a distinctive reddish or purplish discoloration on the underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during early spring, followed by black, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and stream banks. Its ornamental value and ecological importance make it a notable species in native plant gardens."
