    "intro": "Rhodoleia parvipetala, commonly known as the small-petaled rhodoleia, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white to pale pink during the spring. These flowers are followed by small, round berries that turn red as they mature. Rhodoleia parvipetala is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded environments."
