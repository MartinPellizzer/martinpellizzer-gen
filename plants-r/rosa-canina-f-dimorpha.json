    "intro": "Rosa canina f. dimorpha, commonly known as the dog rose variant with double flowers, is a botanical variant of the common dog rose. It is characterized by its distinctive double-flowered form, which features both showy petals and functional stamens. This form is a result of natural mutation and is often found in wild populations. The plant typically grows as a shrub with thorny stems and dark green, serrated leaves. It produces fragrant, pinkish-red flowers that bloom in spring, followed by red, hairy fruits known as hips."
