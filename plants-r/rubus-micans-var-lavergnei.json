It is characterized by its distinctive silvery undersides on its leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically edible. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, loamy soils. The shrub is often found in woodland edges and disturbed areas, where it plays a role in local ecosystems."
