It is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves that can grow up to 30 cm in diameter. The plant produces unique, spiky seed capsules that contain toxic seeds, which are used in traditional medicine and as a source of castor oil. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and as a decorative plant."
