    "intro": "Rhinanthus scepusiensis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved yellow-rattle, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, characterized by its parasitic nature, as it derives nutrients from its host plants. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It typically grows in grassland habitats and is often found in association with other hemiparasitic species. Its ecological role includes supporting pollinators and contributing to the biodiversity of its native ecosystems."
