    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus subsp. fuscus, commonly known as the brown-leaved buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features basal leaves that are palmately lobed and often have a reddish or brownish hue, distinguishing it from the more common white-leaved varieties. The plant produces showy yellow flowers with five petals, typically in early spring. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in some regions."
