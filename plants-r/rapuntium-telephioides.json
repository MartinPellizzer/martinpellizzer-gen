    "intro": "Rapuntium telephioides, commonly known as the common thistle, is a flowering plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is a biennial or perennial herb that typically grows to a height of 30\u2013100 cm, with hairy stems and spiny leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are followed by spherical, prickly seed heads. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its defensive spines, it is often considered a weed but also has historical uses in herbal medicine."
