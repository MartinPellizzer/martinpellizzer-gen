It exhibits characteristics of both parent species, including thorny stems and aggregate fruits. The plant is typically shrub-like, with compound leaves and flowers that are usually white or pale pink. It thrives in temperate climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. The fruit is prized for its sweet, tart flavor and is often used in jams, pies, and fresh consumption."
