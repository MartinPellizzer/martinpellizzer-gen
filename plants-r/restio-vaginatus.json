    "intro": "Restio vaginatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved restio, is a perennial grass-like plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny white or pale yellow flowers. Restio vaginatus typically grows in coastal areas and sandy soils, often forming dense stands in wet or saline environments. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticulture for its unique appearance."
