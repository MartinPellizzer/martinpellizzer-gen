    "intro": "Ranunculus dissectifolius, commonly known as the dissected buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features delicate, showy flowers with bright yellow petals and a central cluster of numerous stamens. The plant's leaves are finely divided, giving it a lacy appearance, and are typically arranged in a basal rosette. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be challenging to grow outside its native habitat."
