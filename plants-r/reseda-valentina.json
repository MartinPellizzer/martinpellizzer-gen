It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many other flowering plants with small, cross-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters and produces clusters of yellow or white flowers in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are upright and somewhat woody at the base.
