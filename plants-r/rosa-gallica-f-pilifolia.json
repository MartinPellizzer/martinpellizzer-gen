    "intro": "Rosa gallica f. pilifolia, commonly known as the white gallica rose, is a fragrant, deciduous shrub native to Europe. It features thorny stems and dark green, lobed leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces showy, single or semi-double flowers in shades of white to pale pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It is well-suited for garden cultivation due to its hardiness and ornamental value. The form 'pilifolia' refers to its hairy foliage, distinguishing it from other forms of Rosa gallica."
