    "intro": "Rubus hebecarpos microgene disjunctiflorus, commonly known as the disjunct-flowered bramble, is a rare and specialized member of the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, featuring disjunctive flower clusters that set it apart from other Rubus species. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks, where it thrives in nutrient-rich soils. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated margins, and its fruits are aggregate berries that develop from multiple small drupes. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
