    "intro": "Roridula tetrandra, commonly known as the sticky bladder plant, is a unique succulent native to South Africa. It is characterized by its glandular, sticky leaves that trap insects, providing it with nutrients. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in summer. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. Roridula tetrandra is notable for its specialized adaptations to survive in nutrient-poor soils."
