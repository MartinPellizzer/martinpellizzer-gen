    "intro": "Rubus micans var. tenebricosus, commonly known as the shadow bramble, is a variant of the common bramble species. It is characterized by its dark, almost blackish stems and leaves, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and thickets. Its flowers are usually small and white, with five petals, and it produces edible berries that are similar to those of other Rubus species. This variant is notable for its adaptability to low-light conditions and its role in supporting local wildlife."
