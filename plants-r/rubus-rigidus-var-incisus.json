    "intro": "Rubus rigidus var. incisus, commonly known as the prickly blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and dark purple to black berries that ripen in late summer. The leaves are typically trifoliate, with serrated edges that contribute to its rugged appearance. This plant thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodlands and hedgerows. Its berries are edible but can be quite tart, making them suitable for jams and preserves."
