    "intro": "Rubia tinctoria, commonly known as common madder, is a flowering plant native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, reddish-purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces a deep red dye from its roots, which has been historically used in textile and pigment industries. Its leaves are alternate, heart-shaped, and have a slightly hairy texture. Rubia tinctoria thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or cultivated areas."
