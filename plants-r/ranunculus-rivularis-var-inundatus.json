It features delicate yellow flowers with five petals and numerous stamens, typical of the Ranunculaceae family. The plant has finely divided, floating leaves that help it thrive in waterlogged soils. It often grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and marshes. Its presence indicates healthy wetland ecosystems due to its sensitivity to environmental changes."
