    "intro": "Roscoea yunnanensis var. dielsiana, commonly known as the Yunnan roscoea, is a rhizomatous perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan, China. It belongs to the Zingiberaceae family, which includes gingers, and is characterized by its robust, fleshy rhizomes and showy inflorescences. The plant produces clusters of narrow, strap-shaped leaves and bears striking, orange-red flowers with a distinctive, elongated spathe. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded, forested areas at high elevations. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive plant in horticultural collections."
