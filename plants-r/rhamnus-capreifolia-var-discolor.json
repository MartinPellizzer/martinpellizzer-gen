    "intro": "Rhamnus capreifolia var. discolor, commonly known as the variegated buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and its striking variegated leaves that display shades of white, yellow, and green. The plant produces small, dark blue berries that are edible but not particularly palatable to humans. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a slightly serrated margin. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often used in ornamental landscaping for its aesthetic appeal."
