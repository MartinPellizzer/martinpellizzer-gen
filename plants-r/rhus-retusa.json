    "intro": "Rhus retusa, commonly known as the staghorn sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark that resembles the antlers of a stag, hence its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, fuzzy berries that attract birds and other wildlife. Its leaves are compound, with 11 to 31 oval-shaped leaflets, and they turn bright red in the fall. Rhus retusa is often found in dry, open woodlands and thrives in full sun to partial shade."
