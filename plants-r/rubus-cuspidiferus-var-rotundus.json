It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces aggregate fruits, known as drupes, which are typically dark purple to black when ripe. These fruits are edible, though the plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ecological benefits. It thrives in a variety of soil types and prefers full sun to partial shade."
