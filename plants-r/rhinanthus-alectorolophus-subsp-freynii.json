    "intro": "Rhinanthus alectorolophus subsp. freynii, commonly known as the Freyn's yellow-rattle, is a flowering plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially depends on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant produces yellow-orange flowers that bloom from June to August, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It typically grows in open grasslands and disturbed soils, often in the UK and parts of Europe. Its presence is an indicator of low-nutrient, well-drained habitats."
