    "intro": "Rosa fricatrix, commonly known as the creeping rose, is a shrub-like plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features thorny stems that often grow close to the ground, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are compound, consisting of five to seven oval-shaped leaflets. Rosa fricatrix is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping for its ability to spread and cover ground effectively."
