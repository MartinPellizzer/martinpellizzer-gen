    "intro": "Ranunculus porrectidens, commonly known as the creeping buttercup, is a species of flowering plant in the family Ranunculaceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of smooth, waxy leaves and produces clusters of bright yellow, star-shaped flowers. The plant is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and is often found in moist, disturbed soils such as along roadsides or in meadows. It has a creeping growth habit, with stems that spread horizontally and produce roots at the nodes. The flowers typically bloom in spring and are pollinated by insects, making it an important plant in ecological systems."
