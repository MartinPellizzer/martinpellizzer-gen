    "intro": "Rumex transitorius, commonly known as common sorrel, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive heart-shaped leaves that are often reddish or purple-tinged on the veins. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, fertile soils and is often found in woodland edges, meadows, and along stream banks. The leaves are edible and have a tart, sour flavor due to their high oxalic acid content."
