    "intro": "Rubus prehensibilis, commonly known as the clinging blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and the presence of tendrils that allow it to climb and cling to supports. The plant produces dark purple to black berries that are edible and have a tart flavor. Its leaves are typically trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its fruit."
