    "intro": "Rosa adjecta var. genuina, commonly known as the Armenian rose, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant produces oval, red berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
