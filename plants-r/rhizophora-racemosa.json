    "intro": "Rhizophora racemosa, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a species of mangrove tree native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia and the Pacific. It is characterized by its prop roots, which provide structural support in soft, waterlogged soils and aid in gas exchange. The plant thrives in brackish water environments and plays a crucial role in stabilizing shorelines. Its flowers are small and clustered, and it produces woody fruits that contain buoyant seeds for dispersal. Rhizophora racemosa is an important component of mangrove ecosystems, supporting a diverse array of marine and terrestrial life."
