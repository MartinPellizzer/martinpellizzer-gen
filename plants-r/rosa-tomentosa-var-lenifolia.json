    "intro": "Rosa tomentosa var. lenifolia, commonly known as the silky rose or soft-haired rose, is a deciduous shrub native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its soft, fuzzy foliage and clusters of fragrant, pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters and has thorny stems that provide structural support. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a dense covering of fine, white hairs that give it a silvery appearance. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal and mild fragrance."
