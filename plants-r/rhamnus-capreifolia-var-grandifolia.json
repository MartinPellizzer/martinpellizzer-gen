    "intro": "Rhamnus capreifolia var. grandifolia, commonly known as the large-flowered buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically glossy and dark green, with a waxy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers in the spring, followed by dark blue berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it an important component of native plant communities and a valuable source of food for wildlife."
