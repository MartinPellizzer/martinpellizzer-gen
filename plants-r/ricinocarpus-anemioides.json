    "intro": "Ricinocarpus anemioides, commonly known as the sea hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Pacific and Indian Oceans. It is characterized by its succulent, palmate leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from yellow to red. The plant thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found in tidal zones and along shorelines. Its fruit is a three-lobed capsule that releases seeds via wind dispersal. Ricinocarpus anemioides plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for small marine and terrestrial organisms."
