    "intro": "Rumex occidentalis var. labradoricus, commonly known as Labrador sorrel, is a perennial herb native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America. It typically grows in moist, rocky soils and is often found in tundra and alpine environments. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters. Its rhubarb-like leaves are edible but contain oxalic acid, making them best cooked before consumption. This variant is part of the Polygonaceae family, which includes other sorrel species."
