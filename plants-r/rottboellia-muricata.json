    "intro": "Rottboellia muricata, commonly known as the hairy fingergrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a hairy texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread aggressively, making it a common weed in disturbed soils. Rottboellia muricata is often found in open areas, lawns, and along roadsides, where it thrives in full sun."
