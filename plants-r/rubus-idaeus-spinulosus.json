    "intro": "Rubus idaeus spinulosus, commonly known as the prickly blackberry, is a species of brambles native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its thorny stems and dark purple to black berries that ripen in late summer. The plant produces compound leaves with serrated edges and small, white flowers that bloom in the spring. Its fruit is edible, though the hairy surface of the berries can be an irritant to the skin. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and hedgerows."
