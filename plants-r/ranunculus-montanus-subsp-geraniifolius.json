It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, yellow flowers with five petals. The subspecies is distinguished by its finely divided, geraniifolius-like leaves that resemble those of the geranium. It thrives in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, often at high altitudes. The plant is typically short-lived and has a low-growing habit, making it a distinctive feature of its habitat."
