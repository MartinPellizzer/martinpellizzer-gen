    "intro": "Rhus copallinum var. arborescens, commonly known as the staghorn sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes furrowed with age. The plant produces compound leaves with three to seven leaflets, and its clusters of yellowish-green flowers give way to red, fuzzy berries. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. The plant has a long history of use in traditional medicine and as a source of dye."
