It typically grows in temperate regions, thriving in well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight. The plant produces dark purple to black berries that are often used in jams and desserts. Its leaves are serrated and have a slightly hairy texture, contributing to its rugged appearance. Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits a wide range of morphological variations, making it a subject of interest in botanical studies."
