    "intro": "Rhyacophila repens, commonly known as the running stonefly, is a species of aquatic insect belonging to the family Rhyacophilidae. It is characterized by its slender, elongated body and long, delicate legs adapted for life in fast-flowing streams and rivers. The larvae are typically found in clean, well-oxygenated waters, where they feed on detritus and algae. Adults are often seen skimming the water surface, and they play an important role in aquatic ecosystems as both predators and prey. This species is an indicator of water quality due to its sensitivity to pollution and habitat degradation."
