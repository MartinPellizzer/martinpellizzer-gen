    "intro": "Richteria leontopodium, commonly known as the golden bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves that are often tinged with reddish hues. The plant produces striking yellow flowers arranged in a bell-like cluster, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in specialized gardens."
