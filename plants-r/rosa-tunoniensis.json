    "intro": "Rosa tunoniensis, commonly known as the Tunon's rose, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is native to the high Andes mountains of southern Peru and northern Chile, where it thrives in cool, high-altitude environments. The plant is characterized by its fragrant, pink to white flowers and thorny stems, typical of many rose species. Its leaves are simple and alternate, with serrated edges, and it produces small, red-orange fruits known as hips. Rosa tunoniensis is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in specialized gardens."
