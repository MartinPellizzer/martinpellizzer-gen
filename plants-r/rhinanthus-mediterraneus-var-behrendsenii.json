    "intro": "Rhinanthus mediterraneus var. behrendsenii, commonly known as the Mediterranean yellow rattle, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from the roots of other plants while also performing photosynthesis. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. This variant is distinguished by its specific geographic distribution and morphological features that set it apart from other rhinanthus species."
