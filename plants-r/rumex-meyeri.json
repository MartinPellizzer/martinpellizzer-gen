    "intro": "Rumex meyeri, commonly known as Meyer's sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Central Asia. It features basal leaves that are heart-shaped with a reddish underside, and it produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in raceme clusters. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Its leaves are edible and have a tangy, sour flavor due to the presence of oxalic acid. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and traditional medicinal uses."
