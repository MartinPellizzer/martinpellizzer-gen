    "intro": "Rumex \u00d7 mezei, commonly known as the meadow sorrel, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Rumex acetosa (common sorrel) and Rumex acetica (garden sorrel). It is a herbaceous perennial with broad, heart-shaped leaves that are typically reddish on the underside. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are borne on slender, erect stems. It thrives in moist, fertile soils and is often found in meadows, gardens, and along stream banks. Its leaves are edible and have a tangy, sour flavor, making it a popular culinary plant in some regions."
