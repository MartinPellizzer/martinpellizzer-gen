    "intro": "Rytidosperma pauciflorum, commonly known as the sparse-flowered grass, is a perennial grass species native to Australia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with few flowers, typically in shades of pale green to brown. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough, hairy texture. Rytidosperma pauciflorum is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient component of native grasslands."
