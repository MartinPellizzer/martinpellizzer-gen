    "intro": "Rheedia bakeriana, commonly known as the Baker's rheedia, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus. The plant is characterized by its hairy, herbaceous stems and showy, pentamerous flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow or orange. Rheedia bakeriana is often found in moist, shaded environments such as cloud forests. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies on plant adaptation and biodiversity in high-altitude ecosystems."
