    "intro": "Rhodiola crassipes var. cretinii, commonly known as the Cretin's rhodiola, is a rare and hardy plant native to the high-altitude regions of the European Alps. It belongs to the family Crassulaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and compact growth habit. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
