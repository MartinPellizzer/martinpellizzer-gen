    "intro": "Ranunculus nemorosus f. pauciflorus, commonly known as the sparse-flowered wood anemone, is a variant of the wood anemone found in temperate regions. It is a herbaceous perennial plant with a basal rosette of leaves and produces showy, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its flowers are usually fewer in number compared to the typical form, giving it its specific epithet \"pauciflorus.\" The leaves are trifoliate, with three deeply lobed leaflets, and the plant is known for its early spring blooming habit."
