    "intro": "Ranunculus pseudosilvicola, commonly known as the alpine buttercup, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its showy, yellow or orange flowers with numerous petals. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are palmately divided, and it produces small, green, ribbed fruits that contain seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
