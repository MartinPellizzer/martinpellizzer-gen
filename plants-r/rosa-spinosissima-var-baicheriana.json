It is characterized by its thorny stems and dense, dark green foliage. The plant produces fragrant, semi-double flowers in shades of pink and white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a hardy ornamental plant. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and by horticultural enthusiasts."
