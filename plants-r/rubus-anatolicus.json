    "intro": "Rubus anatolicus, commonly known as Anatolian blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the mountainous regions of Turkey. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black in color. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils and requires full sun for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and somewhat obscure member of the Rubus genus."
