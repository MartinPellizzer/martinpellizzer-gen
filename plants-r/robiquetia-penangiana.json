    "intro": "Robiquetia penangiana, commonly known as the Penang orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in the understorey of tropical forests. Its leaves are elongated and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), providing structural support while minimizing water loss. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Robiquetia penangiana is considered a vulnerable species."
