    "intro": "Rhodostoma gardenioides, commonly known as the gardenia-like rhodostoma, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its showy, yellow to orange flowers that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous perennial, with lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, although it is not as widely grown as other rhodostoma species."
