    "intro": "Rumex denticulatus, commonly known as the serrated sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Polygonaceae family, which includes other familiar plants like buckwheat and sorrel. The plant features alternate, heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers in dense clusters. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. The plant is known for its edible leaves, which have a tangy, sour flavor due to the presence of oxalic acid."
