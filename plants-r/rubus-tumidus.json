    "intro": "Rubus tumidus, commonly known as the inflated blackberry, is a species of brambles native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its large, hairy, and often inflated fruit, which can grow up to 5 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces clusters of small white flowers that bloom in early summer. Its leaves are typically trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the stems are thorny. The fruit is typically black when ripe, with a sweet and tart flavor, making it a notable wild edible plant."
