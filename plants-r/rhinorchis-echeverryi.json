    "intro": "Rhinorchis echeverryi, commonly known as the Echeverry's orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its intricate, often fragrant flowers that display a range of colors, including white, pink, and purple. The plant typically grows in high-altitude cloud forests, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the misty environment, and it has a symbiotic relationship with specific mycorrhizal fungi. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Rhinorchis echeverryi is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
