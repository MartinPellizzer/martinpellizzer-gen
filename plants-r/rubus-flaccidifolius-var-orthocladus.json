    "intro": "Rubus flaccidifolius var. orthocladus, commonly known as the slender-leaf bramble, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its thin, leathery leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers in the spring, followed by red, hairy berries in the summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as forest understories and stream banks. Botanically, it is notable for its distinctive leaf morphology and its role in local ecosystems as both a food source and habitat provider."
