    "intro": "Rebutia haagei subsp. mudanensis, commonly known as the Mudanensis Rebutia, is a compact, low-growing cactus native to China. It features a globular to cylindrical stem with a smooth, pale green to bluish-gray surface. The plant produces small, funnel-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, or red during the spring and summer months. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil. Its slow growth rate makes it an ideal choice for rock gardens and container cultivation."
