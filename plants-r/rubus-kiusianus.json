    "intro": "Rubus kiusianus, commonly known as the Japanese raspberry, is a species of bramble native to Japan. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, aggregate fruits that resemble raspberries. The plant produces flowers with five pink petals and has palmate leaves with five to seven leaflets. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. The fruit is edible, though it is generally less sweet and more tart compared to cultivated raspberries."
