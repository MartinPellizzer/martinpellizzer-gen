    "intro": "Rosa glauca var. inclinata, commonly known as the blue rose or blue shrub rose, is a variant of the Rosa glauca species. It is characterized by its deep blue or violet flower color, which is a rare trait in roses due to the presence of delphinidin, a type of anthocyanin pigment. The plant is native to the eastern Mediterranean region and thrives in well-drained soils with full sun exposure. It produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique coloration."
