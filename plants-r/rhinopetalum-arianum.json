    "intro": "Rhinopetalum arianum, commonly known as the Armenian orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of Armenia. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring a prominently shaped lip that resembles a horn, giving it its scientific name. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, temperate climates. Its flowers are usually pale green or white, with a delicate appearance that blends into its natural habitat. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Rhinopetalum arianum is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
