    "intro": "Restrepia rhynchantha, commonly known as the Ecuadorian orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Andean regions of Ecuador. It is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a raceme, which are typically fragrant and attract pollinators like bees and moths. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
