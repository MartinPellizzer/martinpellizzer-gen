It features basal leaves that are large, rough, and often covered with stiff hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in dense clusters during the summer months. Its root system is robust, allowing it to thrive in a variety of soil types, including moist or wet environments. Rumex callosus is often found in disturbed areas, such as roadsides and fields, and is sometimes considered a weed."
