    "intro": "Rosa canina var. sylvestris, commonly known as the dog rose, is a wild species of rose native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems, oval leaves with serrated edges, and fragrant pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces distinctive rosehips, which are orange-red fruits containing seeds and are rich in vitamin C. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, sunny locations and is often found in hedgerows and woodland edges."
