    "intro": "Ranunculus sericophyllus var. simpsonii, commonly known as Simpson's silky buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to New Zealand. It features delicate, palmately divided leaves covered in a fine, silky layer of hair, giving it a soft, almost velvety appearance. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
