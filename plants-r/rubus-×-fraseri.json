    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 fraseri, commonly known as the Fraser raspberry. It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Rubus idaeus (red raspberry) and Rubus strumosus (blackberry). This plant is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The flowers are typically white or pale pink, and the fruit is a aggregate of small drupes that can range in color from red to black. It is often cultivated for its edible berries, which have a flavor similar to raspberries but with a slightly tart profile."
