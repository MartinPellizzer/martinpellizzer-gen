    "intro": "Rubus egregius f. effeminatus, commonly known as the delicate raspberry. This is a cultivated form of the raspberry plant, characterized by its smaller, more tender fruits and a softer, less robust growth habit compared to the standard Rubus species. It thrives in cooler climates and requires well-drained, fertile soil to flourish. The plant produces pinkish-white flowers in the spring, which give way to the small, sweet berries in summer. Due to its delicate nature, it is often grown in controlled environments to ensure optimal growth and fruit production."
