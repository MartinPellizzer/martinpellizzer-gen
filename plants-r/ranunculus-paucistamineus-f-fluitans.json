    "intro": "Ranunculus paucistamineus f. fluitans, commonly known as the floating buttercup, is a unique botanical variant characterized by its aquatic or semi-aquatic growth habit. This fern-like plant features delicate, palmately lobed leaves that often float on the surface of water, with submerged leaves that are narrower and more elongated. Its flowers are typically yellow or white, with five sepals and numerous stamens, typical of the Ranunculaceae family. The plant thrives in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and wetlands. Due to its specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in certain regions."
