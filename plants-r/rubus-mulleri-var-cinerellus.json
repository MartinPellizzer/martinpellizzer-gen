    "intro": "Rubus mulleri var. cinerellus, commonly known as the silverleaf blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to China. It is characterized by its distinctive silvery-gray undersides on its leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, dark berries that are typically less flavorful compared to other blackberry varieties. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and unique foliage, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
