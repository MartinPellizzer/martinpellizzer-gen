    "intro": "Ranunculus forreri, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada buttercup, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of California and Nevada. It is characterized by its delicate, cup-shaped flowers that typically range in color from yellow to orange. The plant features basal leaves with lobed edges and a hairy stem that supports its showy blooms. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its range."
