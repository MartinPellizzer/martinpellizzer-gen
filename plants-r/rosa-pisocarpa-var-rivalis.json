    "intro": "Rosa pisocarpa var. rivalis, commonly known as the rival rose, is a less commonly cultivated variant of the Rosa pisocarpa species. It is native to parts of South America, particularly in regions of Argentina and Chile. The plant is characterized by its fragrant, semi-double pink flowers that bloom in late spring. Its foliage is dark green and glossy, providing a striking contrast to the blooms. The plant is relatively hardy, though it prefers well-drained soil and partial shade for optimal growth."
