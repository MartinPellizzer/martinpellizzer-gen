    "intro": "Royena lucida, commonly known as the shining leaf orchid, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, lance-shaped leaves that often have a waxy, glossy appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically pale green or yellowish in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found growing in forest undergrowth.
