    "intro": "Remijia obscura, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a terrestrial orchid with a unique morphology, featuring a slender, leafless stem and small, pale green or white flowers. The plant relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, making it highly dependent on its environment. Its lack of true leaves and reliance on symbiotic relationships highlight its specialized adaptations. Due to habitat loss and ecological disturbances, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
