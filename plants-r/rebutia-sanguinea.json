It features a compact, branching stem with small, spiny leaves that are often tinged with red at the tips. The plant produces vibrant orange to red flowers during the spring and summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements make it a popular choice for arid climate gardens."
