    "intro": "Randia dumetorum, commonly known as the swamp rosemary, is a flowering plant native to the wetlands of the southeastern United States. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in moist, acidic soils, often found in swamps and along riverbanks. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a slightly aromatic scent when crushed. Randia dumetorum is also known for its medicinal properties, traditionally used by Native American communities for its purported health benefits."
