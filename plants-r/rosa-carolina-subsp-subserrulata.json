It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of fragrant, pink to white flowers that bloom in the spring. The leaves are pinnately compound, with serrated edges that are more pronounced than in typical roses. This subspecies is adapted to a variety of soil types and thrives in full sun, making it a hardy ornamental plant. Its botanical features make it a valuable species for both ecological and horticultural purposes."
