It features long, thin, branching stems that are often covered in a layer of fine, white hair. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom during the summer months. Its fruits are small, red berries that contain seeds, which are dispersed by birds. Due to its unique appearance and growth habit, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
