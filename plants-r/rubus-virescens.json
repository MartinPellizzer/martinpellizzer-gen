    "intro": "Rubus virescens, commonly known as the green-leaf blackberry, is a species of bramble native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and thorny stems, which support its climbing nature. The plant produces aggregate fruits composed of small, dark red to black drupelets, which are typically harvested in late summer. Its leaves are alternate, palmately compound, and have a distinctive serrated margin. Rubus virescens thrives in moist, wooded areas and is often found in the understory of deciduous forests."
