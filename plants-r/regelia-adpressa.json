    "intro": "Regelia adpressa, commonly known as the dwarf regelia or the rock cycad, is a unique plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit. The plant features thick, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and have a waxy texture. Regelia adpressa produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, and it is adapted to thrive in arid and rocky environments. Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in collections and is considered a rare and valuable plant."
