    "intro": "Rhododendron japonicum f. aureum, commonly known as the golden leaf rhododendron, is a compact evergreen shrub native to Japan. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage that exhibits a striking golden-yellow color, especially in the summer months. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to red, typically blooming in late spring. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by both its foliage and floral display, though it requires careful attention to soil conditions for optimal growth."
