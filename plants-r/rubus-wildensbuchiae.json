    "intro": "Rubus wildensbuchiae, commonly known as the wildensbuchia raspberry, is a species of bramble native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red when mature. The plant features compound leaves with serrated edges and thorny stems typical of the Rubus genus. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous regions with cool climates. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and less-studied species within the Rubus family."
