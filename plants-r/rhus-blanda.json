    "intro": "Rhus blanda, commonly known as smooth sumac, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern and central United States. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 feet and features compound leaves with 15 to 31 pairs of leaflets. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red, fuzzy berries in the fall. Smooth sumac is often found in open woods, fields, and along roadsides, and it thrives in well-drained soils. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional herbal remedies."
