It is characterized by its bright yellow or orange fruits, which are typically smaller than those of other raspberry species. The plant produces compound leaves with serrated edges and has thorny stems typical of the Rubus genus. It thrives in moist, woodland environments and is often found in the understory of deciduous forests. The flowers are white or pale pink, with five petals, and appear in early summer."
