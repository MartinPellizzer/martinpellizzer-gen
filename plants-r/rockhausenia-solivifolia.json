    "intro": "Rockhausenia solivifolia, commonly known as the rockhouse fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the southeastern United States. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in rocky crevices and along stream banks. The plant features finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of ferns. Due to its limited habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species."
