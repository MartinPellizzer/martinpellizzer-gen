    "intro": "Rhamnus tetragona, commonly known as the four-angled buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, four-angled stems and small, alternate leaves that are typically elliptic to ovate in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are followed by dark blue, berry-like fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and stream banks. Rhamnus tetragona is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
