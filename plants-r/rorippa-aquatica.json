    "intro": "Rorippa aquatica, commonly known as watercress, is a aquatic plant that thrives in freshwater environments such as ponds, streams, and ditches. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, alternate leaves that are typically submerged or floating. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often in late spring to early summer. Its roots are fibrous and help anchor it in muddy or sandy substrates. Watercress is known for its peppery flavor and has been used in culinary and medicinal applications for centuries."
