    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus subsp. deformis, commonly known as the yellow crowfoot, is a member of the Ranunculaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers with five broadly ovate petals. The subspecies deformis differs from the typical form by having smaller, more rounded petals and a more compact inflorescence. Native to the Pacific Northwest of North America, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are palmately divided, contributing to its ornamental value in gardens."
