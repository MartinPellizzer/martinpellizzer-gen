    "intro": "Rosa prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate rose, is a low-growing shrub native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features slender, trailing stems that often lie close to the ground, forming a mat-like structure. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its foliage consists of dark green, ovate leaves with serrated edges, and it is well adapted to rocky or sandy soils. Rosa prostrata is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
