    "intro": "Rubia requienii, commonly known as the Requien's madder, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the Mediterranean region and parts of North Africa, where it thrives in rocky and arid environments. The plant is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Rubia requienii is also valued for its historical use in dye production, similar to other species in the Rubia genus."
