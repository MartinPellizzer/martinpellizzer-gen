    "intro": "Rubus nitidus microgene opaciformis, commonly known as the opaciform bramble, is a shrub native to the temperate regions of the Pacific Northwest. It is characterized by its dense, thorny growth and small, dark green leaves with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces clusters of white to pale pink flowers in early summer, followed by red, edible berries in late summer. Its foliage is often covered in a fine, opacifying pubescence, giving it a distinctive appearance. This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
