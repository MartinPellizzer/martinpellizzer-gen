It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its distinctive two-horned calyx at the base of its flowers, which gives it its common name. Its leaves are typically ovate to elliptic in shape and often have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Rinorea bicornuta is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories."
