    "intro": "Rauvolfia angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leafed rosywood, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender, often woody stems and small, elliptical leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that are typically borne in the axils of the leaves. Its fruits are follicles that contain several seeds, and the plant is often found in moist, shaded forest environments. Rauvolfia angustifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
