    "intro": "Rosa gocciadorensis, commonly known as the Gocciadorensis rose, is a rare and unique species native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its striking, deep red flowers with a velvety texture and a distinctive, almost droplet-like appearance on its petals. The plant has a compact growth habit and produces fragrant blooms throughout the spring and early summer. Its leaves are dark green, glossy, and arranged in an alternate pattern along the stems. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
