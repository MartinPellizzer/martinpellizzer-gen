    "intro": "Rubus mutabilis, commonly known as the variable blackberry, is a species of bramble native to western North America. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and its ability to produce fruit that changes color as it ripens, ranging from green to red to black. The plant produces aggregate fruits composed of tiny achenes, which are often referred to as berries. Its leaves are typically trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it has prickly stems covered in fine hairs. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and along streambanks."
