    "intro": "Rorippa hispida, commonly known as the hispid water-cress, is a small, aquatic or semi-aquatic flowering plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in wetlands, ditches, and along the edges of ponds and streams. The plant has alternate, ovate to lance-shaped leaves that are often covered with fine, stiff hairs, giving it a rough texture. Its flowers are small, white or pale yellow, and arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Rorippa hispida is known for its ability to thrive in moist environments and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature."
