It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, dark purple to black berries. The plant produces trifoliate leaves with serrated edges and hairy surfaces. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in hedgerows and woodland edges. The berries are edible but can be quite tart and are sometimes used in jams or wines."
