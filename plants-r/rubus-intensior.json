    "intro": "Rubus intensior, commonly known as the intense raspberry, is a species of brambles native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, aggregate fruits that range in color from red to black. The plant produces edible berries that are often used in culinary applications, though they are generally smaller and less flavorful than common raspberries. Botanically, it belongs to the Rosaceae family and is closely related to other Rubus species. Its adaptability to high-altitude environments makes it an important component of alpine ecosystems."
