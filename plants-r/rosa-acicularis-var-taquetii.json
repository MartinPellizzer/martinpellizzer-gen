It is characterized by its spiny stems and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant produces narrow, leathery leaves and has a compact growth habit, making it well adapted to its alpine environment. It is often found in rocky soils and is considered a valuable species for botanical research due to its unique morphology and limited distribution. This variety is also prized in horticulture for its ornamental value and hardy nature."
