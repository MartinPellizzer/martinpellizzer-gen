    "intro": "Rhaponticum longifolium subsp. ericeticola, commonly known as the alpine rhubarb, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in clustered heads, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been cultivated for its edible rhubarb-like stalks."
