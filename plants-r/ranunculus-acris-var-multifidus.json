    "intro": "Ranunculus acris var. multifidus, commonly known as the divided buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with numerous petals that bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens but is also considered an invasive species in some regions."
