    "intro": "Rubus serpens var. longiramulus, commonly known as the long-stemmed blackberry vine, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a perennial shrub that produces dark purple to black berries, which are typically harvested in late summer. The plant has trailing stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively along the ground. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and its flowers are white with five petals. The berries are edible, though they are generally less sweet and more tart compared to other blackberry varieties."
