    "intro": "Rhododendron galioides, commonly known as the bog rhododendron, is a deciduous shrub native to the wetlands and bogs of eastern North America. It features lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white tomentum. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to red, typically blooming in late spring. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and requires consistent moisture. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
