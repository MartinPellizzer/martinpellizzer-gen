    "intro": "Rhododendron pseudochrysanthum var. rufovelutinum, commonly known as the red velvet rhododendron, is a rare and striking evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage that ranges from deep green to reddish-brown, giving it a unique, velvety appearance. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of pink to red, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and requires partial to full shade, making it a prized addition to shaded gardens. Due to its limited distribution and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by specialty growers."
