    "intro": "Ranunculus nivalis subsp. altaicus, commonly known as the alpine buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in rocky or alpine meadows, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant features palmately divided leaves and produces showy yellow flowers with five petals. It is adapted to harsh mountain environments, with a short growing season and frost-resistant characteristics. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
