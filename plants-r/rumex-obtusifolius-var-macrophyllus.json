    "intro": "Rumex obtusifolius var. macrophyllus, commonly known as broad-leaved dock, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features large, broad, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are often surrounded by bracts. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in disturbed areas. Its leaves are edible but can be quite tart, and the plant has been used historically in traditional medicine."
