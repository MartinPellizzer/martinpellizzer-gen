    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 cryptadenoides, commonly known as the blackberry raspberry, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Rubus ursinus (blackberry) and Rubus idaeus (raspberry). It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with three to five leaflets. The plant produces aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black in color, with a sweet-tart flavor. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its edible fruits. Botanically, it exhibits traits of both parent species, making it a valuable example of hybrid vigor in the Rubus genus."
