    "intro": "Rhinanthus \u00d7 puberulus, commonly known as the common yellow toadflax, is a hybrid plant belonging to the family Orobanchaceae. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on its host plants for water and nutrients while still performing photosynthesis. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Its flowers are yellow and bilaterally symmetrical, with two lips and a tubular corolla. It is often found in the British Isles and has a widespread distribution across Europe."
