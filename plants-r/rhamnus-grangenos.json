    "intro": "Rhamnus grangenos, commonly known as the narrow-leaf buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by black, egg-shaped berries in the fall. It is often found in woodland edges, hedgerows, and rocky soils, and it can thrive in a variety of light conditions. The berries are a food source for birds and other wildlife, contributing to its ecological significance."
