    "intro": "Rhododendron cloiophorum var. roseotinctum, commonly known as the pink-stained rhododendron, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its vibrant pink to purple flowers, which bloom in early spring. The plant features dense, leathery foliage that is typically dark green with a slight pubescent texture. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and requires partial to full shade for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
