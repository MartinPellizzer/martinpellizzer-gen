    "intro": "Rosa glauca subsp. caballicensis, commonly known as the Caballic Mountain rose, is a shrub-like plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs. The flowers are typically pale pink to white, with five petals and numerous stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments. This subspecies is of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
