    "intro": "Rhododendron erosum, commonly known as the dwarf rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of China, Korea, and Japan. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring dense, evergreen foliage with elliptical leaves that are dark green and leathery in texture. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to white, blooming in early spring. It prefers acidic, well-drained soils and thrives in partially shaded to sunny conditions. Rhododendron erosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its compact growth and showy blossoms."
