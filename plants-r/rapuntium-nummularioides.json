    "intro": "Rapuntium nummularioides, commonly known as the silverleaf saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features small, round, silver-gray leaves that are densely packed, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in early summer, which are typically borne on short, hairy stalks. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a decorative plant in cooler climates."
