    "intro": "Ruellia suaveolens, commonly known as sweet rosel, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are usually violet or blue in color, arranged in spikes at the ends of the stems. These flowers bloom from late spring to early autumn, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Ruellia suaveolens is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in well-drained soil and full sun."
