    "intro": "Rubus spissifolius, commonly known as the dense-leaved blackberry, is a species of brambles native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with closely spaced, serrated leaflets. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically harvested in the fall. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight. Due to its aggressive growth habit, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural settings."
