    "intro": "Ranunculus marsicus, commonly known as the Marsic Ranunculus, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of southeastern Europe. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family, characterized by its showy, often brightly colored flowers. The plant typically features delicate, palmate leaves and produces flowers with five to eight petal-like sepals. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species in its native range."
