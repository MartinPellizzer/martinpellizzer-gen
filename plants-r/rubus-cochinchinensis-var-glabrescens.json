It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red when mature. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The smooth, glabrous surface of its fruits distinguishes this variety from other Rubus species."
