    "intro": "Rubus lesdainii, commonly known as the Lesdain's blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the Rubus genus, which includes many species of shrubs commonly referred to as blackberries or raspberries. The plant produces small, dark berries that are typically harvested for their tart flavor. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species within its native habitat."
