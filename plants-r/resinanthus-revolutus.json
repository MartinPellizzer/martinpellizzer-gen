    "intro": "Resinanthus revolutus, commonly known as the curlleaf spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, waxy, and often sticky resinous secretions that cover its stems and leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky, or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are narrow, curling at the edges, and its small yellow flowers appear in clusters during the spring. The resin produced by this plant has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a source of natural adhesives."
