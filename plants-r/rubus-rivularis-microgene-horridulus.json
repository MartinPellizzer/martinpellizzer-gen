    "intro": "Rubus rivularis microgene horridulus, commonly known as the rough raspberry, is a species of bramble native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces red, hairy berries that are edible but often have a tart flavor. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are typically trifoliate, with serrated edges and a hairy texture."
