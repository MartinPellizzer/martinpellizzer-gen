    "intro": "Reynoldsia sandwicensis var. molokaiensis, commonly known as the Moloka\u02bbi reynoldsia, is a rare endemic plant species found exclusively on the island of Moloka\u02bbi in Hawaii. It is a flowering plant belonging to the Rubiaceae family, characterized by its small, clustered flowers and woody stems. The plant thrives in moist, shaded habitats, typically in forest understories where it competes with other native flora. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, it is considered critically endangered, making conservation efforts essential for its survival."
