    "intro": "Rubus rivularis var. goncyanus, commonly known as the purple-fruited blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to certain regions of North America. It is characterized by its small, dark purple to black berries that are typically smaller than those of the common blackberry. The plant produces compound leaves with serrated edges and thorny stems, typical of many Rubus species. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as stream banks and forest understories. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, and it is often found in association with other shrubs in wetland habitats."
