    "intro": "Rhus platypoda, commonly known as the smooth sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and turn vibrant red in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by red, fuzzy fruits that contain toxic seeds. Its bark is smooth and grayish, and it often grows in open woods or along stream banks. Rhus platypoda plays a role in supporting local wildlife, providing food and shelter for various insects and birds."
