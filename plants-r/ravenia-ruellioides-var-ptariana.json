    "intro": "Ravenia ruellioides var. ptariana, commonly known as the Cape rosewood, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to South Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers in spring, which are followed by small, red, fleshy fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for cultivation in warm, dry climates. Due to its ornamental value and unique wood, it is sometimes harvested for horticultural purposes."
