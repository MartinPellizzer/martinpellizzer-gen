    "intro": "Rubus lejeunei subsp. balneariensis, commonly known as the Balnearia raspberry, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and clusters of small, red berries that ripen in late summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in rocky or forested habitats. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, and it is valued for both its ornamental qualities and edible fruits. This subspecies is relatively rare and is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
