    "intro": "Rhynchosia minima var. tomentosa, commonly known as the hairy burr legume, is a perennial shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by elongated, spiny pods. Its hairy stems and leaves are adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. It is often found in disturbed soils and is used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
