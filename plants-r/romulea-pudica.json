    "intro": "Romulea pudica, commonly known as the shy bellflower, is a small, perennial geophyte native to southern Africa. It produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pale yellow or greenish-white, which help it blend into its natural environment. The plant has a short, fleshy stem and narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to arid conditions. Its flowers open gradually, often in response to specific environmental stimuli, giving it its common name. Romulea pudica is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to survive in dry, coastal regions."
