    "intro": "Rubus luticola, commonly known as the coastal blackberry, is a shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its thorny stems and dark purple to black berries that ripen in late summer. The plant thrives in coastal environments, often growing in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. Its leaves are usually trifoliate, with a serrated margin and a slightly hairy surface. Rubus luticola plays an important ecological role by providing food for local wildlife and stabilizing dunes."
