    "intro": "Raphanistrum vulgare, commonly known as common ragweed, is an annual flowering plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and feather-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in compound inflorescences, which are wind-pollinated. Common ragweed is known for its allergenic pollen, which can cause significant respiratory issues in sensitive individuals. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides, fields, and in waste areas."
