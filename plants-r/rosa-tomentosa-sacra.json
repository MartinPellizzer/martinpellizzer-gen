    "intro": "Rosa tomentosa sacra, commonly known as the sacred woolly rose, is a species native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and clusters of fragrant, pink to white flowers. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous regions with well-drained soil. Its leaves are covered in a fine, white pubescence, which helps protect it from harsh weather conditions. This species is valued not only for its ornamental qualities but also for its cultural and medicinal significance in traditional practices."
