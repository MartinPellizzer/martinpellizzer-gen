    "intro": "Rhododendron eudoxum subsp. pothinum, commonly known as the Pothinum rhododendron, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters, where it thrives in cool, moist, and shaded environments. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, providing a striking contrast to the vibrant pink or red flowers. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with acidic soil and partial shade."
