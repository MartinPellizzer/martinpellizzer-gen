It is characterized by its striking, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features a short, sturdy stem with broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky hair. Its flowers are typically white or pale blue, with a central yellowish area that resembles a star. Robertsonia stellaris is well adapted to moist environments and is often found growing in swampy or seasonally flooded areas."
