    "intro": "Rhinanthus \u00d7 hungaricus, commonly known as the Hungarian yellow rattle, is a hybrid plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It is a hemiparasitic species that partially relies on its host plants for water and nutrients while still performing photosynthesis. This plant is native to Europe and is often found in grasslands and disturbed soils. Its bright orange-red flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant plays a role in ecological systems by influencing host plant growth and providing nectar resources."
