    "intro": "Rubus friburgensis, commonly known as the Fribourg raspberry, is a species of brambles native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or yellow in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers sunny to partially shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
