    "intro": "Rubroshorea leprosula, commonly known as the redshore flameleaf, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking red and orange flowers that bloom in clusters during the warm season. The plant has palmate leaves with a waxy texture, which help it retain moisture in its native habitat. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant in tropical climates."
