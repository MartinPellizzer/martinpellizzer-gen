    "intro": "Rebutia fusca, commonly known as the orange-flowered cactus, is a species native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its compact, globular shape and hairy stems. The plant produces showy, orange-yellow flowers that bloom in spring, adding vibrant color to its desert-like habitat. Rebutia fusca is well adapted to arid conditions, with succulent stems that store water and spines that provide shade and protection. It is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
