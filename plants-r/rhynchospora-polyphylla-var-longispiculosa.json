    "intro": "Rhynchospora polyphylla var. longispiculosa, commonly known as the long-spined flatsedge, is a perennial herb native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces tiny, three-lobed flowers that are typically pale green to brown in color. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Due to its ecological importance, it plays a role in maintaining wetland biodiversity and soil stability."
