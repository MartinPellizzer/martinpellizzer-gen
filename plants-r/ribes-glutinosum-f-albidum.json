    "intro": "Ribes glutinosum f. albidum, commonly known as the white-stemmed currant, is a variant of the sticky currant native to North America. It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its pale green to white stems, which distinguish it from the more common red-stemmed form. The plant produces small, edible berries that are typically yellow or orange in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its unique foliage and fruit."
