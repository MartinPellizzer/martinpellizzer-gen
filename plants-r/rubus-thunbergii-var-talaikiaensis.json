It is a shrub that typically grows in forested areas and along stream banks, thriving in moist, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are usually red or yellow in color, with a tart flavor. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it has thorny stems typical of the Rubus genus. This variety is valued for both its ornamental appeal and its potential use in local food systems."
