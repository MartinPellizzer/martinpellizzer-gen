    "intro": "Rubus calvatifolius, commonly known as the broad-leafed blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its thorny stems, trifoliate leaves, and clusters of small white flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces edible berries that are typically black when ripe, though they are often less flavorful compared to other blackberry species. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodland edges and thickets. Botanically, it is part of the Rubus genus, which includes many other species of raspberries and blackberries."
