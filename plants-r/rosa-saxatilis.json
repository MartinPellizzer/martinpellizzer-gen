    "intro": "Rosa saxatilis, commonly known as the rock rose, is a species of flowering plant in the rose family. It is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in rocky, coastal, and alpine environments. The plant is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, pink to red flowers. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Rosa saxatilis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in gardens and landscaping."
