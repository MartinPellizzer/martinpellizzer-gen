    "intro": "Radermachia quadripinna, commonly known as the Four-needle radermachia, is a low-growing, evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It features compact, fleshy leaves that are typically bluish-green in color, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in shades of pink to red, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Radermachia quadripinna is also valued for its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in harsh, coastal conditions."
