    "intro": "Rhizophora eriopetala, commonly known as the mangrove apple or white mangrove, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rhizophoraceae. It is characterized by its extensive root system, which includes prop roots that help stabilize the plant in tidal zones. The plant produces small, white flowers that are typically borne in clusters, followed by fruits that are spherical and contain a single seed. Rhizophora eriopetala thrives in saline and brackish water environments, often found in coastal mangrove forests. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms."
