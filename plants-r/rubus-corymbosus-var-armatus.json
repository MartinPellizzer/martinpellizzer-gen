    "intro": "Rubus corymbosus var. armatus, commonly known as the prickly blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to North America. It is characterized by its thorny stems and dark purple to black berries that ripen in late summer. The plant typically grows in wooded areas and along stream banks, preferring moist, well-drained soils. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and its flowers are white with five petals. The berries are edible when ripe but are often covered in a fine, fuzzy layer that can be removed before consumption."
