    "intro": "Rubia aparine, commonly known as common hedge bindweed. It is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. The plant features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread aggressively. Its small, greenish-white flowers appear in clusters and bloom from late spring to early summer. The leaves are heart-shaped with a rough, sandpapery texture, and the plant produces small, dark blue berries that are edible but not commonly consumed."
