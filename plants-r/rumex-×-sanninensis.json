    "intro": "Rumex \u00d7 sanninensis, commonly known as the hybrid sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant that belongs to the Polygonaceae family. It is a natural hybrid between Rumex acetosa (common sorrel) and Rumex acetobipinnatus (broadleaf sorrel), resulting in a plant with unique botanical characteristics. The leaves are typically broad and heart-shaped, with a reddish underside and a sour taste due to high oxalic acid content. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, which are followed by three-lobed seed capsules."
