It is a perennial herb that typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving them a rough texture. Its flowers are small and clustered in dense inflorescences, often with a pale yellow or greenish hue. Rochonia aspera is adapted to arid environments and is often found in sandy or rocky soils."
