It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and large, hairy leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces black berries that are typically edible, though they may have a tart flavor. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland or shrubland habitats. Due to its ornamental value and potential for cultivation, it is sometimes grown in gardens and botanical collections."
