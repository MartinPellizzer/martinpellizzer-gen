    "intro": "Rinorea calycina, commonly known as the velvetleaf or red-flowered rinorea, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows up to 3 meters in height, characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves with a leathery texture. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink and red, often with a distinctive calyx that is larger than the petals. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, and it is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Rinorea calycina is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and blooms."
