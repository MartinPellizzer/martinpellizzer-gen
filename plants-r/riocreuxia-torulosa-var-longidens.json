    "intro": "Riocreuxia torulosa var. longidens, commonly known as the long-spined thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its spiny, glabrous leaves and purple to pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has a robust root system adapted to arid conditions. Its foliage is often covered in a waxy cuticle, reducing water loss in its native environment. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local pollinators."
