    "intro": "Rubus corylifolius subsp. serrulatus, commonly known as the serrated bramble, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its compound leaves with serrated margins, which give it its subspecific name. The plant produces small, white to pink flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, edible berries in the summer. It is native to parts of East Asia, including China and Korea, and thrives in temperate climates. This subspecies is often found in woodland edges and moist soils, contributing to local biodiversity."
