    "intro": "Rosa frutetorum var. saxetana, commonly known as the Saxifrage rose, is a compact, shrub-like plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It features dense, thornless stems that often grow close to the ground, forming a low, mat-like structure. The plant produces small, pale pink to white flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are dark green, glossy, and have a slightly serrated edge, contributing to its ornamental appeal. This variety is well-suited for rock gardens and alpine settings due to its hardiness and ability to thrive in well-drained soil."
