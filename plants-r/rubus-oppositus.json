    "intro": "Rubus oppositus, commonly known as the rough-stemmed blackberry, is a species of brambles native to North America. It is characterized by its thorny stems and aggregate fruits that mature to a dark purple or black color. The plant typically grows in moist, wooded areas and thrives in partial to full sunlight. Its leaves are alternate, with serrated edges and a hairy texture. The flowers are white or pale pink, and the plant is known for its edible berries, though they are generally considered less palatable than other blackberry varieties."
