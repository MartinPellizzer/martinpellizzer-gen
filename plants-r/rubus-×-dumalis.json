    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 dumalis, commonly known as the blackberry raspberry, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between blackberry (Rubus ursinus) and raspberry (Rubus idaeus). It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows to a height of 1\u20132 meters, featuring thorny stems and alternate, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces aggregate fruits, known as drupelets, which are usually dark purple to black in color. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its edible berries, which have a flavor combining characteristics of both blackberries and raspberries. The plant is also valued for its ornamental qualities and adaptability to various soil types."
