    "intro": "Ranunculus ingae-taniae, commonly known as the Taniae buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It features showy, cup-shaped flowers with bright yellow petals and a central cluster of stamens, typically blooming in spring. The plant has delicate, trifoliate leaves that are deeply lobed, and it prefers well-drained, moist soils in shaded to partially shaded environments. It is often found in forest understories and along stream banks, where it contributes to the biodiversity of its habitat. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
