It features bright yellow flowers with five petals and a distinctive central stigma, typical of the Ranunculaceae family. The plant has finely divided, trifoliate leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and protected species in its native habitat."
