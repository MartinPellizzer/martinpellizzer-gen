It features compound leaves with serrated edges and small, rose-like flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces red, hairy fruits that resemble rosehips, which are rich in vitamin C. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its botanical characteristics make it a notable species in both horticultural and ecological contexts."
