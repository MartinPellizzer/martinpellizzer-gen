    "intro": "Racinaea, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its unique, elongated, and often translucent leaves that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant lacks traditional roots and instead absorbs nutrients through its leaves, a feature known as epiphytic growth. Its flowers are small, white, and delicate, often appearing in clusters. Due to its habitat specificity and declining population, Racinaea is listed as an endangered species."
