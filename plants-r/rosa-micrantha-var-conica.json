    "intro": "Rosa micrantha var. conica, commonly known as the conical shrub rose, is a compact, deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of China. It features small, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, typically in shades of pink and white. The plant has upright, thorny stems and dark green, glossy foliage that provides a striking contrast to its blooms. It is well-suited for rock gardens or as a container plant due to its compact growth habit. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to produce repeat blooms throughout the growing season."
