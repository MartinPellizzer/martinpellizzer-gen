    "intro": "Rubus cockburnianus, commonly known as Cockburn's blackberry, is a species of bramble native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, dark berries that ripen in late summer. The plant typically grows in forested areas and along stream banks, preferring moist, well-drained soils. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and its flowers are white with five petals. The berries are used in local cuisine and have also been studied for their potential medicinal properties."
