    "intro": "Rhaponticum bicknellii, commonly known as Bicknell's coneflower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and showy, daisy-like flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces a single, elongated flower head composed of yellow disk florets surrounded by white to pale pink ray florets. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Rhaponticum bicknellii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
