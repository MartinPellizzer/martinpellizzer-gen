It is characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves and clusters of deep pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it suitable for shaded garden settings. Its foliage remains dense and attractive throughout the growing season, providing year-round visual interest. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in cooler climates."
