    "intro": "Rhaphiolepis kwangsiensis, commonly known as the Guangxi rosebay, is a deciduous shrub native to southern China. It belongs to the family Ericaceae and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant features glossy, elliptical leaves that are arranged alternately along the stems. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens. Due to its limited natural range, it is considered a rare and endangered species in the wild."
