    "intro": "Rhizophora tagal, commonly known as the mangrove apple or red mangrove, is a species of mangrove tree native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive prop roots that extend into the water, providing structural support in tidal zones. The plant has pneumatophores, which are specialized root structures that facilitate gas exchange in oxygen-poor water. Its small, reddish fruits are buoyant and aid in seed dispersal by water. Rhizophora tagal plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and supporting marine biodiversity."
