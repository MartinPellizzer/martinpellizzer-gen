    "intro": "Rorippa \u00d7 haynaldiana, commonly known as the Himalayan watercress, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Rorippa islandica and Rorippa sylvestris. It is a herbaceous annual plant characterized by its alternate, broadly lanceolate leaves and small, white flowers arranged in racemes. The plant thrives in moist, often aquatic or semi-aquatic environments, such as stream banks and wet meadows. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from waterlogged soils. The species is notable for its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed sites, making it an important component of riparian ecosystems."
