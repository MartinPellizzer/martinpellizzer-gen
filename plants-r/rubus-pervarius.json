    "intro": "Rubus pervarius, commonly known as the blackberry shrub, is a species of bramble native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces aggregate fruits, known as blackberries, which are typically dark purple to black when mature. These berries are rich in antioxidants and are often used in culinary applications. Rubus pervarius thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils."
