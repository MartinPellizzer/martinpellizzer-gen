    "intro": "Rosa \u00d7 ruga, commonly known as the rugosa rose, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Rosa rugosa and Rosa chinensis. It is characterized by its robust growth, often reaching heights of 1 to 3 meters, and its ability to thrive in coastal and saline environments. The plant produces large, showy flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, typically blooming in late summer to early autumn. Its foliage is thick and dark green, with a distinctive rugose (wrinkled) texture on the underside of the leaves. The rugosa rose is also valued for its fragrant scent and is often used in landscaping due to its hardiness and disease resistance."
