It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of narrow, dark green leaves that resemble the spokes of a wheel. The plant typically grows in shallow freshwater habitats such as ponds and slow-moving streams. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often submerged, contributing to its ornamental value in aquariums. Due to its adaptability, it is widely cultivated for both its aesthetic appeal and ecological benefits in aquatic environments."
