    "intro": "Rubus serpens var. acanthophyllus, commonly known as the spinyleaf blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to parts of Central America and the Caribbean. It is characterized by its distinctive spiny leaves and thorny stems, which provide a natural defense against herbivores. The plant produces small, dark red berries that are typically edible but have a tart flavor. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in shaded, moist environments. Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and horticultural contexts."
