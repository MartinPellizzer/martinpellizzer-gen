It is characterized by its dense, bristly hairs on the stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. This form is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often growing in woodland edges and scrublands. The flowers are typically pink or white, with five petals, and the fruit is a red, hairy hip. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used in traditional herbal medicine."
