    "intro": "Rhynchospora cephalantha var. microcephala, commonly known as the small-headed marsh sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in marshes, swamps, and other moist environments, where it thrives in full to partial sunlight. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, three-lobed flowers. Its botanical features include a rhizomatous root system and a distinctive, compact growth habit. This variety is distinguished by its smaller flower heads compared to the typical form of Rhynchospora cephalantha."
