    "intro": "Rosa \u00d7 pervirens var. eriostyla, commonly known as the pink sand rose, is a hybrid shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and clusters of fragrant, semi-double pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant's leaves are compound, consisting of five to seven elliptical leaflets with a slightly serrated margin. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for coastal gardens due to its salt tolerance. The variety is noted for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
