It is characterized by its striking blue or purple ray florets and a spiky, bract-like structure that resembles a crown. The plant thrives in saline and sandy soils, often growing along shorelines and dunes. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a rough texture adapted to withstand coastal conditions. Reseda littoralis is an important plant in coastal ecosystems, providing habitat and nectar for pollinators."
