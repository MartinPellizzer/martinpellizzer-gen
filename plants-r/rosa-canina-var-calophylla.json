    "intro": "Rosa canina var. calophylla, commonly known as the Kashmir rose, is a variant of the dog rose native to the Himalayan regions of India and Pakistan. It is characterized by its pale pink to white flowers, which are typically smaller than those of the common dog rose. The plant produces aggregate fruits known as rose hips, which are rich in vitamin C and have been used in traditional medicine. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with serrated margins, and the stems are armed with hooked thorns. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal remedies."
