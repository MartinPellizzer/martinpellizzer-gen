    "intro": "Rosa \u00d7 dumetorum subsp. solstitialis, commonly known as the creeping pink rose, is a hybrid species native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its trailing stems and clusters of small, fragrant pink flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, coinciding with the summer solstice, hence its common name. Its leaves are compound, consisting of five to seven oval-shaped leaflets, and the plant produces rose hips that are orange-red in color. It is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in full sun to partial shade."
