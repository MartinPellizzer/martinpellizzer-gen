It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and small, hairy leaves that are typically elliptic to ovate in shape. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are usually red or yellow when ripe, containing numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
