    "intro": "Rubus chlorosericeus var. pachypus, commonly known as the thick-leaved blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to certain regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and thorny stems, which are typical features of the Rubus genus. The leaves are usually dark green and have a waxy coating, contributing to its ability to retain moisture in arid environments. Its flowers are small and white, often appearing in clusters, and the plant produces edible, dark purple berries. This variant is valued for both its ornamental appeal and its fruit, which can be used in culinary applications."
