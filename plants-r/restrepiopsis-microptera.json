    "intro": "Restrepiopsis microptera, commonly known as the small-winged restrepiopsis, is a flowering plant native to the Andes region of South America. It belongs to the family Restrepiopsidaceae and is characterized by its compact growth habit and delicate, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, arranged in clusters along the stems. It thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found in high-altitude cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
