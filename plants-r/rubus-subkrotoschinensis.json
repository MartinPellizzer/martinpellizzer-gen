    "intro": "Rubus subkrotoschinensis, commonly known as the Krotoschin raspberry, is a species of bramble native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red when mature, similar to other raspberries in the Rubus genus. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and partial sunlight. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and less-studied species within the Rubus family."
