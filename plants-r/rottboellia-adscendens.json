    "intro": "Rottboellia adscendens, commonly known as the African grass or false rice, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread quickly and form dense mats. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue or purple flowers. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands, rice fields, and along waterways. Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in certain environments."
