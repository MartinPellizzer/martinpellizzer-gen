    "intro": "Rubus lefievrei, commonly known as the Lefievre's bramble, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is native to eastern Asia, particularly China and Russia, and thrives in temperate climates. The plant is characterized by its thorny stems, compound leaves, and clusters of white to pink flowers. Its fruits, known as berries, are typically small and edible, though they are not as commonly consumed as other Rubus species. The plant plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
