    "intro": "Rubus serpens var. heterophylloides, commonly known as the variable blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to parts of North America. It is characterized by its distinctive leaf morphology, which includes both trifoliate and simple leaves on the same plant, a trait known as heterophylly. The plant produces small, dark purple to black fruits that are typically edible. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest in studies on plant adaptation and morphological variation."
