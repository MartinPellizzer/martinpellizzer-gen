    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus subsp. rotarius, commonly known as the golden crowncup, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features showy, yellow flowers with a distinctive crown-like structure, and its leaves are deeply lobed and often hairy. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in woodland or meadow habitats. It blooms from late spring to early summer, and its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly different leaf morphology and floral structure compared to other ranunculus species."
