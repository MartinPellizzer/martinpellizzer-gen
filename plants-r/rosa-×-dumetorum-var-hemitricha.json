    "intro": "Rosa \u00d7 dumetorum var. hemitricha, commonly known as the creeping rose or evergreen rose, is a hybrid species characterized by its dense, thorny growth habit. It is a low-growing shrub with dark green, leathery leaves that remain evergreen throughout the year. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant pink or white flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in well-drained soil with full sun exposure. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in landscaping for erosion control and as a ground cover."
