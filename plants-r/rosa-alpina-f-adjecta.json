    "intro": "Rosa alpina f. adjecta, commonly known as the alpine rose or the alpine form of the dog rose, is a botanical variant of the species Rosa alpina. It is a deciduous shrub native to the alpine regions of Europe, characterized by its compact growth habit and dense foliage. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink to white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and covered in fine, soft hairs, while its stems are thornless and covered in a layer of whitish, glandular hairs. This form is prized for its ornamental value and adaptability to rocky, well-drained soils in high-altitude environments."
