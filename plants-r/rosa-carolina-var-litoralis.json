    "intro": "Rosa carolina var. litoralis, commonly known as the coastal rose, is a variant of the Carolina rose that thrives in coastal environments. It is characterized by its pale pink to white flowers and fragrant scent, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has a low-growing habit with arching stems and is adapted to sandy, well-drained soils. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it produces red-orange hips that contain seeds. This species is often found in dunes and other coastal habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing sand and preventing erosion."
