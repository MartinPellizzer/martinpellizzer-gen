    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 obornyanus, commonly known as the hybrid blackberry raspberry, is a deciduous shrub belonging to the Rosaceae family. It is a naturally occurring hybrid between Rubus ursinus (blackberry) and Rubus chamaemorus (cloudberry), resulting in a plant with unique botanical characteristics. The plant typically grows in temperate regions, preferring moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it produces aggregate fruits that are a mix of blackberry and raspberry traits. The hybrid is notable for its adaptability and is often found in disturbed or wetland habitats."
