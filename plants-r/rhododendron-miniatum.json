    "intro": "Rhododendron miniatum, commonly known as the miniature rhododendron, is a compact evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of China. It features small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and densely packed along its stems. The plant produces clusters of delicate, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, white, and red, often blooming in late spring. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soil and prefers partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance, it is a popular choice for gardeners seeking a compact, flowering shrub."
