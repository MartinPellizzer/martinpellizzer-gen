    "intro": "Rosa communis var. tomentelloides, commonly known as the woolly rose, is a compact, deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, fuzzy grayish-white pubescence covering the stems, leaves, and flowers, giving it a distinctive, soft appearance. The leaves are pinnately compound, with five to seven elliptical leaflets, and the flowers are typically pink or white, with a subtle fragrance. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is cultivated in many temperate climates."
