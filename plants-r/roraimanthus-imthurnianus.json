    "intro": "Roraimanthus imthurnianus, commonly known as the Roraima orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the tepuis of South America. It is characterized by its striking, often brightly colored flowers that bloom in the cool, humid conditions of its high-altitude habitat. The plant typically grows in rocky crevices and is adapted to the extreme environmental conditions of the tepui plateaus. Its small size and specific ecological requirements make it a challenging species to cultivate outside its natural range. Due to its limited distribution and habitat fragility, it is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts."
