    "intro": "Rubus rivularis var. helveconicus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to eastern North America. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows along stream banks and moist woodland areas. The plant features slender, thorny stems and compound leaves with three to five oval-shaped leaflets. Its flowers are small, white, and clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by dark purple or black berries. The botanical characteristics of this variant make it distinct from other Rubus species, particularly in its leaf morphology and habitat preferences."
