    "intro": "Rosa communis subvar. fastigiata, commonly known as the upright or columnar rose, is a compact, shrub-like rose with a unique, narrow growth habit. It features tightly packed, dark green foliage and produces fragrant, single or semi-double flowers in shades of pink, red, or white. This variety is well-suited for small spaces due to its upright form and minimal lateral branching. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, requiring regular pruning to maintain its shape. The plant is relatively disease-resistant and suitable for both garden borders and container planting."
