    "intro": "Ranunculus \u00d7 digeneus nothosubsp. latemarensis, commonly known as the Alaskan buttercup, is a hybrid plant native to the western regions of North America. It is characterized by its showy, yellow flowers with a distinctive white center and deeply lobed petals. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks. It has a short, creeping rhizome and produces achenes with feathery pappi for wind dispersal. Due to its hybrid origin, it exhibits variability in morphology and is of interest in botanical studies."
