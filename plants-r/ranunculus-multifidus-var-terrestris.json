    "intro": "Ranunculus multifidus var. terrestris, commonly known as the creeping buttercup, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of Europe and western Asia. It features a mat-forming growth habit with slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with five to nine petals, often accompanied by two sepals that resemble additional petals. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a distinctive lobed structure that aids in photosynthesis. This species thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks."
