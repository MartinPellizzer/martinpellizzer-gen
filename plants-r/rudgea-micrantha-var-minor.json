    "intro": "Rudgea micrantha var. minor, commonly known as the lesser rudgea, is a shrub native to the Andean regions of South America. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers during the spring and early summer. Its fruits are follicles that split open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
