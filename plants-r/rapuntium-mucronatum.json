It is characterized by its small, cruciform flowers that typically bloom in early spring. The plant has alternate, pinnately lobed leaves that are covered in fine hairs. It grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas."
