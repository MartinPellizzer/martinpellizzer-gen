    "intro": "Rhynchosia, commonly known as the \"cowpea vine\" or \"wild bean,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. These plants are characterized by their climbing habit, trifoliate leaves, and showy, butterfly-like flowers that range in color from white to purple. Rhynchosia species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. They produce pods that contain small, edible seeds similar to beans, though some species are cultivated for their ornamental value. The genus also includes several species used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
