    "intro": "Ranunculus ophioglossifolius var. fontanus, commonly known as the Fontana buttercup, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It features a basal rosette of finely divided, fern-like leaves that give it its species name, ophioglossifolius, meaning \"serpent-tongue leaf.\" The plant produces showy yellow flowers with five petals and numerous stamens, typical of the Ranunculaceae family. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
