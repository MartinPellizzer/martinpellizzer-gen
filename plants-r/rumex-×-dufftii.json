    "intro": "Rumex \u00d7 dufftii, commonly known as the hybrid sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant that exhibits characteristics of both its parent species, Rumex acetosa (common sorrel) and Rumex acetobipinus (broadleaf sorrel). It typically grows in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and waste grounds. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive reddish or purple coloration on the veins, and it produces small, greenish flowers in clusters. Its rhubarb-like leaves are edible but contain oxalic acid, which can be harmful in large quantities. This hybrid is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been cultivated for both horticultural and culinary purposes."
