    "intro": "Rubus amplior, commonly known as the broadleaf blackberry, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is native to the southeastern United States, where it thrives in woodland and thicket habitats. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically three to five leaflets, and its aggregate fruits, which develop from multiple ovaries. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, and the plant produces thorny stems typical of many Rubus species. The fruit is edible, though often tart, and is used in local culinary traditions."
