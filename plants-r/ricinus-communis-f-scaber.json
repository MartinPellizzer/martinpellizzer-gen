    "intro": "Ricinus communis f. scaber, commonly known as the rough castor plant, is a variant of the castor oil plant characterized by its hairy, rough-textured leaves. It is native to tropical regions and thrives in warm, humid climates. The plant produces distinctive spiny capsules that contain toxic seeds, which are used in traditional medicine and industrial applications. Its foliage is often used as a ornamental plant due to its unique appearance. The plant's botanical features make it both ecologically significant and potentially hazardous to handle."
