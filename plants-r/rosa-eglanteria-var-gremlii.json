    "intro": "Rosa eglanteria var. gremlii, commonly known as the Alpine rose or Gremli's rose, is a shrub native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and thorny stems, which provide structural support and protection. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant pink flowers in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are pinnately compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets with serrated edges. This variety is well adapted to cold climates and is often found growing in rocky or mountainous terrain."
