    "intro": "Rhododendron angiense, commonly known as the Angolan rhododendron, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Angola. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and showy, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant typically grows in rocky or forested areas, thriving in cool, humid climates with well-drained soil. Its ornamental value has made it a subject of interest for horticulturists, though it is less commonly cultivated than other rhododendron species."
