    "intro": "Rhizophora parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered mangrove, is a species of mangrove tree native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive pneumatophores, which are specialized roots that protrude above the soil to facilitate gas exchange in waterlogged soils. The plant thrives in brackish water environments and plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems. Its small, white flowers are typically borne in clusters and are adapted for pollination by wind or insects. Rhizophora parviflora is also important for its ability to filter sediments and improve water quality in mangrove habitats."
