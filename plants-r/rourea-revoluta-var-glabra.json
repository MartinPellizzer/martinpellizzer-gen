    "intro": "Rourea revoluta var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth rourea, is a shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous stems and leaves that are often elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which bloom during the wet season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The leaves are usually leathery and have a waxy surface, which helps reduce water loss in its native habitat."
