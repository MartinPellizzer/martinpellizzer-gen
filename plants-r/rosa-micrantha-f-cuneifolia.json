    "intro": "Rosa micrantha f. cuneifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf rock rose, is a compact, shrub-like plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It features small, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink to white, appearing in late spring to early summer. The leaves are lance-shaped and have a dense, bushy growth habit, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. This variety is valued for its hardiness and ability to thrive in well-drained soils. It is also noted for its ornamental appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
