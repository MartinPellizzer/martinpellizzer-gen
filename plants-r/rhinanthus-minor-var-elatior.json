    "intro": "Rhinanthus minor var. elatior, commonly known as the greater yellow rattle, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellow, bilaterally symmetrical flowers that bloom from June to August. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients through its root system. It typically grows in grasslands, meadows, and disturbed soils, often forming dense colonies. Its ecological importance includes supporting pollinators and contributing to the biodiversity of its habitat."
