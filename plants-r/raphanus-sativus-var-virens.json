    "intro": "Raphanus sativus var. virens, commonly known as the green radish, is a variety of the radish plant characterized by its leafy green foliage and edible root. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes other cruciferous vegetables like broccoli and cauliflower. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with pinnately compound leaves and small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. Its roots are usually smaller and less pungent than those of the common red radish, making it suitable for fresh consumption. The green radish is valued for its crisp texture and mild flavor, often used in salads or as a garnish."
