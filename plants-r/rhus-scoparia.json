    "intro": "Rhus scoparia, commonly known as the prickly ash or staghorn sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often covered in fine, glandular hairs that give the plant a slightly sticky texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by red, fuzzy berries that are an important food source for birds and wildlife. Rhus scoparia is adapted to a variety of soil types and can thrive in full sun to partial shade. Its distinctive appearance and ecological value make it a notable species in native plant gardens and natural habitats."
