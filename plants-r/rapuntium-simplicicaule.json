    "intro": "Rapuntium simplicicaule, commonly known as the simple-stemmed cress, is a flowering plant in the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, alternate leaves that are typically oval to lance-shaped. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to spread easily in new habitats."
