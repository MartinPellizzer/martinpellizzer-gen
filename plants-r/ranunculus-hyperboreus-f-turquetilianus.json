    "intro": "Ranunculus hyperboreus f. turquetilianus, commonly known as the Turquetilian buttercup, is a rare and frost-tolerant plant native to Arctic and alpine regions. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its bright yellow, cup-shaped flowers. The plant has finely divided, serrated leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold environments. It thrives in nutrient-poor, rocky soils and is typically found in tundra and mountainous habitats. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to climate change, it is considered a vulnerable species."
