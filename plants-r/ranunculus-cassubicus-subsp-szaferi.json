    "intro": "Ranunculus cassubicus subsp. szaferi, commonly known as the Szafer's buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the Carpathian region. It features delicate, palmately divided leaves and bright yellow flowers with five to seven petals. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in woodland or meadow habitats. It blooms from late spring to early summer, and its flowers are often visited by bees and other pollinators. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and protected species in many areas."
