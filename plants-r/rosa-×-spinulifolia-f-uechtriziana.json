    "intro": "Rosa \u00d7 spinulifolia f. uechtriziana, commonly known as the Uechtriziana rose, is a botanical hybrid belonging to the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its thorned stems and dense, spiny foliage, which are adaptations for deterring herbivores. The plant produces fragrant, semi-double flowers in shades of pink and white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are compound, with ovate to lanceolate leaflets arranged alternately along the stems. This cultivar is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and hardy nature, thriving in well-drained soil and full sun."
