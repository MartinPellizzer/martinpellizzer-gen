    "intro": "Rhododendron alutaceum var. alutaceum, commonly known as the alpine rhododendron, is a compact shrub native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It features dense, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and often have a slight pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments with acidic soil and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with appropriate growing conditions."
