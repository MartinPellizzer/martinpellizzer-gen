    "intro": "Rondeletia nemoralis, commonly known as the common rondeletia, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its opposite, simple, and often hairy leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or red, with five petals and a prominent tubular corolla. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds."
