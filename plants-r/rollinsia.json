    "intro": "Rollinsia, commonly known as the \"Mexican water lily,\" is a genus of aquatic plants native to Central and South America. It belongs to the family Nympheaceae, which includes true water lilies, and is characterized by its floating leaves and showy, fragrant flowers. Rollinsia species typically have broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, with roots submerged in the aquatic environment. The flowers are usually pink or white, and they open in the morning, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. These plants play an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen to aquatic life."
