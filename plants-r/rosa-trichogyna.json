    "intro": "Rosa trichogyna, commonly known as the hairy rose, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its thorny stems and dense, woolly foliage, which provide a unique texture. The plant produces fragrant, pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically alternate and have a serrated edge, while the fruit is a red, fuzzy rose hip. Rosa trichogyna is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to grow in well-drained soils with full sun exposure."
