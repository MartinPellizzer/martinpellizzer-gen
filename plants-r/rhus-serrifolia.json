    "intro": "Rhus serrifolia, commonly known as the serrated wingnut, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and have serrated margins. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by woody, winged fruits that are distinctive in appearance. Rhus serrifolia thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and open forests. Its botanical features make it an important component of local ecosystems and a subject of study in plant ecology."
