    "intro": "Rumex fueginus var. typicus, commonly known as the Andean sorrel, is a perennial herb native to the high Andes of South America. It is characterized by its basal rosette of dark green, serrated leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are borne on slender, branching stems. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. The leaves are edible and have a tangy, sour flavor, making it a traditional food source for some indigenous communities."
