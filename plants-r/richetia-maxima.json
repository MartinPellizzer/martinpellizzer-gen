    "intro": "Richetia maxima, commonly known as the Mexican giant water lily, is a large aquatic plant native to the wetlands of Mexico. It is characterized by its broad, waxy leaves that can grow up to 3 meters in diameter, floating on the water's surface. The plant produces showy white flowers that bloom in the early morning and close by midday. Its roots are submerged, anchoring it in the muddy bottom of its habitat. Richetia maxima plays an important ecological role by providing shelter for aquatic life and contributing to water filtration."
