    "intro": "Ranunculus yaoanus, commonly known as the Yaoan buttercup, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family, which includes many showy and often toxic species. The plant features finely divided, palmately arranged leaves and produces clusters of small, yellow flowers with five petals. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is typically found in shaded forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
