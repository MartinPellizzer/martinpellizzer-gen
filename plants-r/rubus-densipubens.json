    "intro": "Rubus densipubens, commonly known as the dense-hairy blackberry, is a species of bramble native to western North America. It is characterized by its thick, velvety pubescence that covers its stems, leaves, and fruits. The plant produces aggregate fruits, known as berries, which are typically dark purple to black when mature. Its leaves are palmately lobed with serrated edges, and the flowers are white with five petals. Rubus densipubens is often found in moist, wooded areas and is valued for its edible berries and ecological importance."
