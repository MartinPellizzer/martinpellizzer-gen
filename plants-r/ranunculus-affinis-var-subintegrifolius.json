It features basal leaves that are palmately lobed with hairy margins, distinguishing it from other varieties of the species. The plant produces showy yellow flowers with five petal-like sepals, typical of the Ranunculaceae family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its foliage and flowers are often covered in fine, soft hairs, contributing to its common name."
