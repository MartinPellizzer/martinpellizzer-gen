    "intro": "Rhododendron emarginatum, commonly known as the alpine rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Asia, particularly in the Himalayas. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense clusters of flowers that bloom in shades of pink to purple. The plant typically grows at high elevations, where it thrives in cool, moist, and well-drained soils. Its leaves are leathery and evergreen, providing year-round foliage. Rhododendron emarginatum is often found in alpine meadows and forest edges, contributing to the biodiversity of its native habitat."
