It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically hairy and have a serrated margin. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers in early summer, followed by small, tart berries that are edible. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. This form is distinguished by its dwarf growth habit compared to the typical species."
