    "intro": "Rhaphidophora dunniana, commonly known as the Zebra Plant, is a member of the Araceae family and is native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, striped, dark green leaves with a striking light green or white midrib, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically hidden within a spathe, a leaf-like structure. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistent moisture and high humidity to flourish. Rhaphidophora dunniana is a popular houseplant due to its attractive foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements."
