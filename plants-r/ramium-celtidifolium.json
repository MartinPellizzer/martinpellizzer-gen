    "intro": "Ramium celtidifolium, commonly known as the creeping marsh grass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to wetland and swampy areas in North America. It features slender, rhizomatous stems that spread along the ground, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in spike-like clusters, which bloom in early summer. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Ramium celtidifolium plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
