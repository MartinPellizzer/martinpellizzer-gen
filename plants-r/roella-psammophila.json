    "intro": "Roella psammophila, commonly known as the sand flat sedge, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is a perennial herb with slender, grass-like leaves that grow close to the ground. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or pale green flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typical of the Cyperaceae family. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Roella psammophila plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for small desert organisms."
