    "intro": "Ruppia brachypus subsp. bahusiensis, commonly known as the Bahusian water plant, is a submerged aquatic plant native to specific regions in Southeast Asia. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and slow-moving streams. The plant has slender, ribbon-like leaves that are arranged spirally along its stem. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, often submerged, and it reproduces primarily through vegetative propagation. This subspecies is adapted to low-light conditions and plays a role in stabilizing aquatic sediments."
