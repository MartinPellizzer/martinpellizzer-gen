It is characterized by its unique, elongated leaves that resemble spears, which are often arranged in a basal rosette. The flowers are typically small and clustered in umbels, a common feature among members of the carrot family. Rhabdostigma species are native to southern Africa, where they thrive in rocky or sandy soils. These plants are often used in horticulture for their ornamental value and hardy nature."
