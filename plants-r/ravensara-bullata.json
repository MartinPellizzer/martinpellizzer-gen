    "intro": "Ravensara bullata, commonly known as the broad-leaved raven's arum, is a striking tropical plant native to the wetlands of eastern Australia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in diameter, often with a deep green color and a velvety texture. The plant produces striking purple and white spathes that enclose its spadix, which is covered in small, inconspicuous flowers. Ravensara bullata is an aquatic or semi-aquatic plant that thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local biodiversity."
