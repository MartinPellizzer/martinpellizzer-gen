    "intro": "Rosa canina f. analoga, commonly known as the Turkish rose or the dog rose, is a shrub native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems, pinnately compound leaves, and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant produces bright red, hairy fruits called hips, which are rich in vitamin C. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often found in hedgerows and woodland edges. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in herbal medicine."
