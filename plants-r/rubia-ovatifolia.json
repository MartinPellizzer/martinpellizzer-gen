It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes many species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its lanceolate leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in the summer. Its roots contain a red pigment called rubia, which has been historically used in dyeing textiles. Rubia ovatifolia thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
