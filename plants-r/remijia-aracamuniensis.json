    "intro": "Remijia aracamuniensis, commonly known as the Aracamuni remijia, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its striking, large, velvety leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to deep red. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its mountainous habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
