    "intro": "Rosa abietina f. gaschurnensis, commonly known as the Gaschurnen rose, is a rare and unique botanical variant of the Rosa abietina species. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink and white. Native to the alpine regions of Central Europe, this plant thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil. Its leaves are dark green and serrated, while its stems are covered in fine, silvery hairs. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a botanical curiosity and a subject of interest for horticulturists and botanists alike."
