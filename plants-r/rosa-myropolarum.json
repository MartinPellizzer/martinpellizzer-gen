    "intro": "Rosa myropolarum, commonly known as the Arctic rose, is a low-growing shrub native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Eurasia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink. The plant's leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold, harsh environments. Rosa myropolarum is adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils and can withstand extreme temperature fluctuations. Its botanical features make it an important component of polar and mountain ecosystems."
