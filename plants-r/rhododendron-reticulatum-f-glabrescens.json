    "intro": "Rhododendron reticulatum f. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth-leaved rhododendron, is a compact evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It features dense, glossy dark green leaves that are smooth and leathery, distinguishing it from its more hairy relatives. The plant produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to red, typically blooming in late spring. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and long-lasting floral display."
