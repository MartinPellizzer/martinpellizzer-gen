    "intro": "Rhamnus buergeri, commonly known as Japanese buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to Japan. It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are often glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by black, spherical berries that are a food source for birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or forest edges. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain regions."
