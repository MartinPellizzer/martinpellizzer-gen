    "intro": "Rosa erronea, commonly known as the \"erroneous rose,\" is a rare and elusive species within the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate pink petals and thornless stems, which distinguish it from many other rose species. Native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, it thrives in cool, temperate climates with well-drained soil. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring, adding a subtle beauty to its natural habitat. Due to its limited distribution and fragile ecosystem, Rosa erronea is considered a conservation concern."
