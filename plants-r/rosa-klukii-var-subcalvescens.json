    "intro": "Rosa klukii var. subcalvescens, commonly known as the Alaska rose, is a shrub-like species native to the coastal regions of Alaska and northern Canada. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and dark green, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The flowers are typically pink to red, with five petals and a strong, sweet fragrance, blooming in late summer. This variety is adapted to cold climates and is often found growing in moist, well-drained soils near the shoreline. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to thrive in harsh, northern environments."
