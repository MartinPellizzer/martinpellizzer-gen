    "intro": "Rhetinantha cerifera, commonly known as the waxleaf shrub, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage with a waxy, glossy texture that gives it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for use as a hedge or ornamental plant in gardens. The leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported therapeutic properties."
