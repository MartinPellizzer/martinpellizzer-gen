It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers with deeply lobed petals. The subspecies is distinguished by its darker, more obscure sepals compared to the typical form. Its leaves are palmately divided, and the plant often forms dense clusters. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and is relatively easy to cultivate in suitable conditions."
