    "intro": "Ravensara, commonly known as the blackwood tree, is a species native to the eastern coast of Australia. It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 20 meters tall, characterized by its dark, almost black bark and glossy, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for native wildlife. Ravensara is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional Aboriginal medicine for its various therapeutic properties."
