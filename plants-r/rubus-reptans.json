    "intro": "Rubus reptans, commonly known as the creeping raspberry, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its trailing growth habit, with stems that root at the nodes. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits called drupes, which are typically red or orange in color. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it blooms with white or pale pink flowers in the spring. Rubus reptans is often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and stream banks."
