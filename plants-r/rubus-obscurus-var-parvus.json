    "intro": "Rubus obscurus var. parvus, commonly known as the small-stemmed bramble, is a shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its slender, thornless stems and small, elliptical leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces clusters of white to pale pink flowers in early summer, which are followed by small, edible berries. It thrives in woodland understories and moist, acidic soils, often forming dense thickets. Due to its modest size and limited range, it is less commonly cultivated than other bramble species."
