It is a flowering shrub native to East Asia, characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and showy clusters of small, pink or white flowers. The plant produces bright red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its compact growth habit and seasonal color changes.
