    "intro": "Rosa canina f. livida, commonly known as the dark form of the dog rose, is a botanical variant of the common dog rose, Rosa canina. It is characterized by its dark purple to almost black stems and foliage, which distinguish it from the typical pink or red-hued varieties. This form is less commonly cultivated than its more colorful relatives but is valued for its unique appearance and hardy nature. It produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, hairy fruits known as hips. The plant is native to Europe and western Asia and is often found in woodland edges and hedgerows."
