    "intro": "Rapanea fastigiata, commonly known as the upright or narrow-leaved evergreen, is a shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by red berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it suitable for ornamental gardening. Due to its dense foliage and compact form, it is often used as a hedge or foundation plant in landscape design."
