    "intro": "Roraimaea aurantiaca, commonly known as the red-barked orchid, is a striking epiphytic orchid native to the tepuis of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant orange flowers and distinctive red-barked stems, which give it its common name. The plant thrives in the humid, misty environments of the tepuis, where it attaches itself to trees and rocks. Its leaves are typically dark green and lance-shaped, contributing to its overall aesthetic appeal. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists alike."
