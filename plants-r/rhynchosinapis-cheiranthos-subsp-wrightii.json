    "intro": "Rhynchosinapis cheiranthos subsp. wrightii, commonly known as Wright's bladderpod, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many species with small, four-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has a taproot system that allows it to survive in arid conditions. Its distinctive feature is the inflated, bladder-like pods that contain the seeds. The subspecies is named after John Wright, a botanist who contributed to the study of North American flora."
