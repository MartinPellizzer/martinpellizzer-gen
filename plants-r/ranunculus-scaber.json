    "intro": "Ranunculus scaber, commonly known as the hairy buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a basal rosette of hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, bristly hairs. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with five to eleven sepals that resemble petals, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and can be found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. Ranunculus scaber is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
