    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus subsp. evolutus, commonly known as the golden buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its bright yellow, cup-shaped flowers with 5\u201315 petals, which bloom in early spring. The plant has finely divided, trifoliate leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, helping to reduce water loss. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, stream banks, and forest clearings. The subspecies evolutus is distinguished by its more elongated and slightly curled petals compared to the typical form of R. auricomus."
