    "intro": "Ricinus communis f. fumatus, commonly known as the smoky castor oil plant, is a variant of the castor oil plant characterized by its distinctive, velvety, and smoky-colored foliage. The leaves are typically large, palmately lobed, and covered in fine, soft hairs that give them a fuzzy appearance. This cultivar is prized for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes due to its unique aesthetic. It thrives in warm, sunny conditions and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. The plant is also capable of producing the same toxic castor beans as the species, though its primary use is decorative rather than agricultural."
