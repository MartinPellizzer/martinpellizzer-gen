    "intro": "Reseda lutea var. minor, commonly known as lesser yellowweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, yellow flowers and narrow, linear leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its hardy nature, it is considered a weed in some agricultural settings."
