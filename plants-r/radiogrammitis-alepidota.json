    "intro": "Radiogrammitis alepidota, commonly known as the slender rock fern, is a small, terrestrial fern native to the temperate regions of the Southern Hemisphere. It typically grows in rocky or shaded environments, often on soil or among stones. The plant has slender, creeping rhizomes and produces small, delicate fronds with a linear to lanceolate shape. Its spores are released from compact, clustered sori located on the underside of the fronds. Radiogrammitis alepidota is characterized by its simple, unbranched fronds and is often found in moist, well-drained soils."
