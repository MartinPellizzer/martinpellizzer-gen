    "intro": "Rubus chrysocarpus, commonly known as the golden-fruited blackberry, is a species of bramble native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically yellow or orange in color, which are edible but have a tart flavor. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forested areas with well-drained soils. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
