    "intro": "Rumicastrum granuliferum, commonly known as the granular burrplant, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant's fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that contains numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It has adapted to survive in harsh environments with low rainfall and poor soil conditions. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in its native habitat."
