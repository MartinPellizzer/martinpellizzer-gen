    "intro": "Rotala filiformis f. hiernii, commonly known as the narrow-leaf waterwheel plant, is a compact, aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It features finely divided, ribbon-like leaves that float on the water surface, giving it a delicate, lacy appearance. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, often resembling a wheel, hence its common name. It thrives in shallow, slow-moving waters with moderate to high light exposure. This variety is popular in aquariums and ponds for its ornamental value and ability to help control algae growth."
