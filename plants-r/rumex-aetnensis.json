    "intro": "Rumex aetnensis, commonly known as the Aetna sorrel, is a perennial herb native to the volcanic regions of Sicily. It is characterized by its distinctive red-veined leaves and clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant thrives in rocky, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in subalpine and alpine environments. Its leaves are edible and have been used in traditional cuisine, though they contain oxalic acid. The species is also of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to high-altitude habitats."
