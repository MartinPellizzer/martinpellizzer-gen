    "intro": "Rhysotoechia bifoliolata subsp. bifoliolata, commonly known as the two-leafed rhysotoechia, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique leaf morphology, featuring two distinct leaflets on each compound leaf. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, where it relies on specific symbiotic relationships with fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are small and clustered, often displaying a pale green to yellowish hue. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, this subspecies is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
