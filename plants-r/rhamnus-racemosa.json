    "intro": "Rhamnus racemosa, commonly known as the red-berried buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in racemes, followed by red or black berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions. The bark is smooth and often has a reddish hue, contributing to its common name."
