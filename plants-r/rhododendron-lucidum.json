    "intro": "Rhododendron lucidum, commonly known as the shining rhododendron, is a species native to the Himalayas, particularly in regions of India, Nepal, and Bhutan. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to red. The plant typically grows in high-altitude forests and rocky slopes, preferring cool, moist environments. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Rhododendron lucidum is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
