    "intro": "Rhynchospora pfeifferi, commonly known as the Pfeiffer's spikegrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, commonly known as the sedge family, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically reddish or purplish in color, which bloom during the summer months. Rhynchospora pfeifferi is often found in marshes, swamps, and other moist environments, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity. Its morphology and habitat preferences make it an important indicator species for wetland health."
