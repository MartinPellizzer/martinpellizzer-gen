    "intro": "Rebutia applanata, commonly known as the flat-topped prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to central and southern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, disc-like stems that are often covered in white, woolly spines. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stems. Rebutia applanata is well adapted to arid environments and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
