    "intro": "Rebutia orurensis, commonly known as the Desert Cactus or the Mexican Cactus, is a species of flowering cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and its ability to store water in its thick, fleshy stems. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. Its foliage is covered in fine, white hairs that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Rebutia orurensis is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and drought tolerance."
