    "intro": "Ranunculus praemorsus, commonly known as the death's-head hawkmoth plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to southern Europe. It features showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to yellow, often with a distinctive dark center. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is found in meadows and along stream banks. Its leaves are palmately divided and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are erect and often branched. The species is notable for its role in supporting pollinators, particularly the death's-head hawkmoth."
