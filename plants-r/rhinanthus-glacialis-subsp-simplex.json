    "intro": "Rhinanthus glacialis subsp. simplex, commonly known as the alpine common toadflax, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes at high altitudes. Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive species in many regions."
