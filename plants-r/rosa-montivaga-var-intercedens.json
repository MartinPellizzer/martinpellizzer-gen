    "intro": "Rosa montivaga var. intercedens, commonly known as the Alpine rose, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and vibrant pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features simple, alternate leaves with serrated margins, and its stems are often covered in thorns. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine landscapes."
