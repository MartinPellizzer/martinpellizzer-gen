    "intro": "Rubus pilocalyx, commonly known as the hairy raspberry. It is a species of bramble native to eastern North America, characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of white flowers. The plant produces small, red, edible fruits that are similar to raspberries but have a distinct, slightly tart flavor. Its leaves are usually trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the plant thrives in moist, woodland habitats. Rubus pilocalyx plays an important role in supporting local wildlife, including birds and insects."
