    "intro": "Rubus radula var. vestitus, commonly known as the hairy everlet raspberry. This variant of the everlet raspberry is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and thorny stems, which provide protection against herbivores. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and forest understories. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are usually red or yellow in color. Its botanical features make it well adapted to cool, humid climates and contribute to its ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
