    "intro": "Rumex crispus, commonly known as curly dock, is a perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North America. It is characterized by its wavy, serrated leaves that are often covered in a whitish, powdery coating. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by triangular, reddish-brown seeds. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides, in fields, and near water bodies. Rumex crispus has been used historically for its medicinal properties and as a vegetable in some cultures."
