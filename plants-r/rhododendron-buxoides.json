    "intro": "Rhododendron buxoides, commonly known as the dwarf rhododendron, is a compact evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It features dense, dark green foliage that is highly ornamental and often used in landscaping for its lush appearance. The plant produces showy, clustered flowers in shades of pink to red, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soil and requires partial to full shade for optimal growth. Due to its slow growth rate and compact form, it is well-suited for rock gardens or as a foundation plant in shaded areas."
