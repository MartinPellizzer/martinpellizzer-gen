    "intro": "Ribes smithianum, commonly known as Smith's gooseberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 3 to 5 lobed, and its clusters of yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, edible berries that are typically red or yellow when ripe, which are often used in jams and preserves. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Ribes smithianum is also valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological importance, providing food for birds and pollinators."
