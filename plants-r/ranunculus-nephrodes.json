    "intro": "Ranunculus nephrodes, commonly known as the kidneyleaf buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features basal leaves that are kidney-shaped, with a distinctive lobed appearance, and stems that bear alternate, palmately compound leaves. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with five petals, often accompanied by numerous stamens. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks. The species is notable for its toxic sap, which contains protoanemonin, a compound that can cause skin irritation."
