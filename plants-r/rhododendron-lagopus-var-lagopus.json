    "intro": "Rhododendron lagopus var. lagopus, commonly known as the alpine azalea, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and showy, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in high-altitude habitats, such as alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, providing a striking contrast to the vibrant pink or red flowers. The plant is well adapted to harsh environments, with its compact growth form helping it withstand strong winds and cold temperatures."
