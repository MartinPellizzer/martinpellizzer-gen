    "intro": "Ruellia pumila, commonly known as the dwarf ruellia, is a low-growing herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Ruellia pumila thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded to partially shaded environments. It is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to form dense ground cover."
