    "intro": "Rosa umbelliflora var. longifrons, commonly known as the long-fruited sand rose, is a perennial shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is characterized by its woody stems, dense foliage, and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces distinctive, elongated fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in sandy soils and is adapted to coastal climates with high salinity and wind exposure. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
