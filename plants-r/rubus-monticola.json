    "intro": "Rubus monticola, commonly known as the mountain raspberry, is a species of bramble native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, aggregate fruits that mature to a red or black color. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and rocky slopes. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it produces white or pale yellow flowers in the spring. Rubus monticola plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for various wildlife species."
