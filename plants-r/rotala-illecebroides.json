    "intro": "Rotala illecebroides, commonly known as the red root water lettuce, is a floating aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It features rosettes of waxy, heart-shaped leaves that are typically bright green with a reddish tinge on the underside. The plant has a fibrous root system that helps it anchor in water and absorb nutrients. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or white, followed by small, round seeds. Rotala illecebroides is often used in aquariums and ponds for its ornamental value and ability to provide habitat for aquatic life."
