    "intro": "Rubus titanus, commonly known as the giant blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is characterized by its large, thorny stems and dark purple to black berries that are highly prized for their intense flavor. The plant produces compound leaves with serrated edges and clusters of small white flowers in the spring. Its berries are rich in antioxidants and have been used in both culinary and traditional medicinal applications. Due to its size and aggressive growth, it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
