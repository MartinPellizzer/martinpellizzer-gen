    "intro": "Rostellularia linearifolia subsp. liangkwangensis, commonly known as the Liangkwaung narrow-leaf rostellularia, is a rare and endemic plant species native to southern China. It is characterized by its slender, linear leaves that are typically arranged in a dense, grass-like structure. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences, often with a faintly fragrant scent. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in mountainous regions with high humidity. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
