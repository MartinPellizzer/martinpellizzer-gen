    "intro": "Rhamnus peruviana, commonly known as the Peruvian buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to South America. It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by dark blue berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions and is often found in dry forests and scrublands. Rhamnus peruviana is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
