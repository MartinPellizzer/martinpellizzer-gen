It features dark green, glossy foliage and produces fragrant, semi-double pink flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant has thorny stems and is well-suited for use as a hedge or ornamental plant in gardens. It prefers full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil, making it relatively easy to care for. Its botanical characteristics make it a popular choice for both landscape design and conservation efforts."
