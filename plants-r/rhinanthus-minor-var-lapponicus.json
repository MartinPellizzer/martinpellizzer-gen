    "intro": "Rhinanthus minor var. lapponicus, commonly known as the northern yellow rattle, is a herbaceous annual plant native to northern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom from June to August, and it typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as grasslands and heaths. The plant has a slender, branched stem with opposite leaves that are linear and hairy. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. This variety is distinguished from the more widespread R. minor by its smaller size and more northern distribution."
