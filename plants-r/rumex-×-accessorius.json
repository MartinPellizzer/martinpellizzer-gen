    "intro": "Rumex \u00d7 accessorius, commonly known as the hybrid sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant that results from the cross between Rumex acetosa (common sorrel) and Rumex acetobulus (broadleaf sorrel). It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive reddish or purple coloration on the veins, which is a key botanical feature. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color, arranged in terminal inflorescences. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a persistent weed in agricultural and disturbed soils. The leaves are edible and have a tart flavor due to their high oxalic acid content, though they should be consumed in moderation."
