    "intro": "Rosa tomentosa var. perturbans, commonly known as the woolly rose, is a shrub-like plant native to the eastern United States. It features dense, grayish-white fuzzy hairs covering its stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, woolly appearance. The plant produces fragrant, pink to red flowers in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically compound, with five to seven leaflets that are oval and serrated. This variety is well adapted to woodland habitats and thrives in partial shade to full sun."
