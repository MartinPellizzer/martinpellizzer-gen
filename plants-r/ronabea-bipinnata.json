    "intro": "Ronabea bipinnata, commonly known as the blackwood tree, is a tropical evergreen species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark, almost black bark and dense, compound leaves with a bipinnate structure. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by elongated, woody fruits containing flat, bean-like seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
