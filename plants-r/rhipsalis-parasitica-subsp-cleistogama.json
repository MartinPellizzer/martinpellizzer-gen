    "intro": "Rhipsalis parasitica subsp. cleistogama, commonly known as the cleistogamous rhipsalis, is a unique epiphytic cactus native to parts of South America. It is characterized by its lack of leaves and its ability to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. The plant produces small, white, often closed (cleistogamous) flowers that rarely open, which is an adaptation for self-pollination. Its stems are wiry and can grow in dense clusters, making it well-suited for climbing. This subspecies is valued in horticulture for its unusual appearance and low maintenance requirements."
