    "intro": "Rubus napophilus, commonly known as the coastal blackberry, is a shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves, which are typically arranged in an alternate pattern. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are dark purple to black in color when mature. It thrives in moist, coastal environments and is often found in sandy or gravelly soils. Due to its hardy nature, it plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for local wildlife."
