    "intro": "Rumex acetosella var. oblongifolius, commonly known as narrow-leaved sorrel, is a variant of the common sorrel species. It is a low-growing perennial plant characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often reddish underneath. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, typically in early spring. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. This variant is less common than the typical form but shares many ecological and botanical similarities with its parent species."
