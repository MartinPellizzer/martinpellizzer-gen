    "intro": "Rubus dorcheei, commonly known as the Dorchee blackberry, is a species of brambles native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically harvested in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species in its native habitat."
