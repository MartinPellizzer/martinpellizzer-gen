    "intro": "Rhododendron galactinum, commonly known as the white alpine azalea, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its showy, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils and cool climates. Its leaves are dark green, leathery, and elliptical in shape, providing a striking contrast to the delicate flowers. Rhododendron galactinum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural environment."
