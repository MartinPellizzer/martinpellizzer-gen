    "intro": "Rubus borreri proles griffithianus, commonly known as the Griffith's raspberry, is a species of brambles native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its woody stems, trifoliate leaves, and small, aggregate fruits that are typically red when mature. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous regions with rocky soils. It produces white or pale yellow flowers in the spring, followed by the development of its edible berries. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
