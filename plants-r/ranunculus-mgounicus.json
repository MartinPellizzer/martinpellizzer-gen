    "intro": "Ranunculus mgounicus, commonly known as the Algerian buttercup, is a perennial herb native to the Maghreb region of North Africa. It features a basal rosette of deeply lobed, dark green leaves and produces showy, yellow flowers with prominent white veins. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. It has a short flowering period in spring and is characterized by its delicate, cup-shaped blooms. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
