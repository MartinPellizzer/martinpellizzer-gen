It features slender, cylindrical stems that are often covered in small, white spines. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by red, fleshy fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks. Its unique appearance and ability to climb make it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
