    "intro": "Rhododendron subulatum, commonly known as the needleleaf rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage composed of needle-like leaves that are typically dark green and slightly glossy. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often blooming in late spring. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers cool, moist environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in temperate climates."
