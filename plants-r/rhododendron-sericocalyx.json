    "intro": "Rhododendron sericocalyx, commonly known as the silverleaf rhododendron, is a species native to the Himalayas, particularly in regions of India and Nepal. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage that is covered in a fine, silvery-white bloom, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its flowers are usually pink or white, appearing in clusters and blooming in late spring to early summer. The leaves are leathery and elliptical, providing a striking contrast to the showy floral display."
