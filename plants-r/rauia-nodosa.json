It belongs to the family Araceae, which includes many aquatic and semi-aquatic species. The plant is characterized by its striking, spatulate leaves and a distinctive inflorescence that consists of a spadix surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. Rauia nodosa typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and botanical gardens."
