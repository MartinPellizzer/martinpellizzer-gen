    "intro": "Racosperma idiomorphum, commonly known as the narrow-leafed wattle, is a small shrub native to Australia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, often zigzagging stems and feathery, bipinnate leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in spikes, which are typical of many wattles, and it is adapted to thrive in dry, sandy soils. Racosperma idiomorphum is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility in its native environment."
