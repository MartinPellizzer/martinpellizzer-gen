    "intro": "Rhinorchis heringeri, commonly known as the Heringer's orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often near streams or in forest understories. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to greenish-white, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insects. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in several countries."
