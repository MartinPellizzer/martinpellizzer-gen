    "intro": "Rosa micrantha var. multiflora, commonly known as the Chinese rose or multiflora rose, is a deciduous shrub native to China. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, fragrant pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces oval, dark green leaves with serrated edges, and its fruit is a red, hairy rose hip. It is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and as a natural hedge due to its vigorous growth. However, it can become invasive in some regions if not properly managed."
