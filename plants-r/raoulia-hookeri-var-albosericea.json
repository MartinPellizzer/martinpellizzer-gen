    "intro": "Raoulia hookeri var. albosericea, commonly known as the white silky raoulia, is a rare and striking plant native to Madagascar. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its soft, silvery-white hairs covering its stems and leaves, giving it a unique, almost ethereal appearance. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stem, while the flowers are small and pale, often clustered in inflorescences. This variant is distinguished by its notably white, silky foliage, which sets it apart from other Raoulia species. Due to its limited distribution and fragile nature, it is considered a conservation concern in its native habitat."
