    "intro": "Rochelia jackabaghii, commonly known as the Jackabaghii marsh orchid, is a rare and specialized plant found in specific wetland habitats. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, grass-like appearance with small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-rich soils, often in areas with seasonal flooding. Its flowering period occurs during the late spring to early summer, and it relies on specific pollinators for reproduction. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered endangered in many regions."
