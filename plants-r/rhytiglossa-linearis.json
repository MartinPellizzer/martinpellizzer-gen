    "intro": "Rhytiglossa linearis, commonly known as the slender rock orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its linear, grass-like leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in open woodlands or along stream banks. It has a rhizomatous root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor environments. Rhytiglossa linearis is an important component of its native ecosystem, providing habitat and nectar for various pollinators."
