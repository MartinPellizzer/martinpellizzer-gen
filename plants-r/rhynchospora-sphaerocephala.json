The plant has a fibrous root system and thrives in saturated soils, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems. Its flowers are often visited by insects, contributing to its role in pollination networks. Rhynchospora sphaerocephala is also valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological significance in maintaining wetland biodiversity."
