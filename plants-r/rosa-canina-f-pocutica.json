    "intro": "Rosa canina f. pocutica, commonly known as the Pocutic rose, is a botanical variant of the dog rose. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and smaller, more delicate flowers compared to the typical Rosa canina. The plant produces red-orange hips that are often used in traditional medicine and culinary applications. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges and hedgerows. Its foliage is dark green and its stems are covered in thorns, typical of the Rosa genus."
