    "intro": "Rosa jundzillii, commonly known as the Jundzillii rose, is a species native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces fragrant, semi-double flowers in shades of pink to red. The plant has dark green, serrated leaves and produces thorny stems, typical of many rose species. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and somewhat challenging plant to grow in cultivation."
