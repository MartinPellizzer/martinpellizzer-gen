    "intro": "Rubus evadens, commonly known as the creeping raspberry, is a species of brambles native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and thorny stems, which help it spread across the ground. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or orange in color, developing from clusters of tiny drupes. Its leaves are compound, with three to five leaflets, and are often covered in fine hairs. Rubus evadens is often found in moist, disturbed soils along stream banks and in open woodlands."
