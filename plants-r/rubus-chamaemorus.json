    "intro": "Rubus chamaemorus, commonly known as the cloudberry, is a low-growing shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It produces small, yellow-orange berries that are highly prized for their tart flavor and nutritional value. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit, with woody stems that root at the nodes. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges and a dark green upper surface. The cloudberry thrives in acidic, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in boggy or wetland environments."
