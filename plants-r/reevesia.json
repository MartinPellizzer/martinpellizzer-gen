    "intro": "Reevesia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, leafless stems and elongated, white or pale green flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. Native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia, Reevesia thrives in humid, shaded environments with high air humidity. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Due to its delicate nature and habitat specificity, Reevesia is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is often considered a conservation concern."
