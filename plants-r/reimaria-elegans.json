    "intro": "Reimaria elegans, commonly known as the elegant reindeer orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. The plant is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, fragrant, white or pale purple flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often covered in a fine, silvery down. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Reimaria elegans is considered a vulnerable species."
