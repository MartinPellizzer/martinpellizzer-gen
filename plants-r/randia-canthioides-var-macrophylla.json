    "intro": "Randia canthioides var. macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaved randia, is a tropical shrub native to the Americas. It is characterized by its glossy, ovate leaves that can grow up to 15 cm in length. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom in summer, followed by red, fleshy berries. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in coastal areas and disturbed soils. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
