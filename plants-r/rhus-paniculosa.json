    "intro": "Rhus paniculosa, commonly known as the smooth sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and turn bright red in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in panicles, which are followed by red, fuzzy berries that are a food source for birds. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is adapted to a variety of soil types. Rhus paniculosa is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
