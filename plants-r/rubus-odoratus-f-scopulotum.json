    "intro": "Rubus odoratus f. scopulotum, commonly known as the rock raspberry, is a variant of the common raspberry that thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and smaller, often reddish berries compared to the typical raspberry. The plant produces fragrant, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by edible fruits in the summer. It is native to regions of Europe and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and edible yield."
