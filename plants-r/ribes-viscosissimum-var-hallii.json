It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces edible berries that are typically red or orange when mature, though they are often covered in a sticky resin. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands and streamside habitats. This variety is notable for its ornamental value and its role in supporting local wildlife."
