    "intro": "Rhinanthus major var. serotinus, commonly known as the late common tickseed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family, which includes several parasitic and hemiparasitic species. This plant is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom late in the growing season, typically from July to September. It grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and woodland edges. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from the roots of other plants while also performing photosynthesis."
