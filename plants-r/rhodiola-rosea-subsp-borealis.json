    "intro": "Rhodiola rosea subsp. borealis, commonly known as the Arctic rhodiola, is a perennial plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and small, pink or white flowers that bloom in late summer. This subspecies is adapted to harsh, cold climates and can thrive in nutrient-poor soils. It is often found in tundra and alpine environments, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local ecosystems. The plant is also valued for its potential medicinal properties, though further research is needed to confirm its efficacy."
