    "intro": "Rhyncholepis haeankeana, commonly known as the Haeank Island fern, is a rare and endemic species native to the Haeank Island in South Korea. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in rocky crevices or dense undergrowth. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
