    "intro": "Rhododendron acrophilum, commonly known as the alpine rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Asia, particularly in the Himalayas. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often found in high-altitude environments where temperatures are cooler and the climate is more temperate. The plant typically produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, which bloom in the spring. Its leaves are usually leathery and dark green, adapted to withstand harsh alpine conditions. Rhododendron acrophilum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
