    "intro": "Rosa canina subsp. squarrosa, commonly known as the squarrose dog rose, is a subspecies of the dog rose native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, reddish stems and small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant typically grows as a shrub, reaching heights of up to 2 meters, and is often found in woodland edges and hedgerows. Its leaves are pinnate, with five to seven leaflets, and the fruit is a red, hairy rose hip that matures in the autumn. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in herbal medicine."
