    "intro": "Rumex lanceolatus, commonly known as narrowleaf sorrel, is a perennial herb native to North America. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are often reddish at the base and have a distinctive sour taste due to the presence of oxalic acid. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, along roadsides, and in woodland edges. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters during the spring and early summer. The leaves and young stems are sometimes used in culinary applications, though they should be consumed in moderation due to their high oxalic acid content."
