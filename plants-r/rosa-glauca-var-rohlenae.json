    "intro": "Rosa glauca var. rohlenae, commonly known as the Rohlen's blue rose, is a rare and striking variant of the Rosa glauca species. It is characterized by its pale blue to lavender-colored petals, which are often described as having a delicate, ethereal appearance. This plant is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. Its flowers typically bloom in late spring to early summer, and it is valued for its ornamental beauty and horticultural rarity. Due to its limited distribution and specific environmental requirements, it is considered a challenging plant to cultivate outside its native habitat."
