    "intro": "Rubus moluccanus var. fontinalis, commonly known as the Fontinalis blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and thorny stems, which help it to climb and spread across vegetation. The leaves are typically trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the flowers are small, white, and clustered in cymes. The fruit, a dark purple to black berry, is edible and has a tart flavor, often used in local cuisines. This variant is valued for its ornamental qualities and its role in traditional herbal medicine."
