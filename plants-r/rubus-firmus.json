It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its thorny stems and dense clusters of dark purple to black berries. The plant is perennial, with woody growth that becomes more compact over time. Its leaves are typically trifoliate, with serrated edges, and its flowers are small, pink to white, appearing in early summer. The berries are edible when ripe but have a tart flavor and are often used in jams and wines."
