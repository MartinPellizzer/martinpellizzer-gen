    "intro": "Rubus malifolius, commonly known as sourberry or false blackberry, is a species of flowering plant in the rose family, Rosaceae. It is a shrub that typically grows in temperate regions, characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces edible berries that are tart and often used in jams or as a flavoring agent. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they consist of three leaflets, and are typically covered in fine hairs. Rubus malifolius is also notable for its medicinal uses in traditional herbal remedies."
