It is characterized by its dark, shiny berries and thorny stems, which are typical features of the Rubus genus. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are often used in culinary applications despite their tart flavor. Its leaves are typically trifoliate, with a serrated edge and a hairy texture. This species thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or shrubland habitats."
