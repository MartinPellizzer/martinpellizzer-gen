    "intro": "Ranunculus montanus var. ayachicus, commonly known as the Ayachic Mountain Crowfoot, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are typically hairy and adapted to cold, arid conditions. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of white, yellow, and orange, often with a distinctive yellow center. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and mountain slopes. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
