    "intro": "Ranunculus peltatus subsp. sphaerospermus, commonly known as the globe-fruit buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, rounded, globular fruit that resembles a small sphere, giving it its subspecific name. The plant features palmate leaves with five to seven lobes and produces showy, yellow flowers with numerous petals. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
