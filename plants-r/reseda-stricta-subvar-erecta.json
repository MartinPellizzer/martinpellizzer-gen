    "intro": "Reseda stricta subvar. erecta, commonly known as upright sickleweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States. It is a low-growing perennial with slender, erect stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has needle-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and gravelly slopes. Reseda stricta subvar. erecta is known for its drought tolerance and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its hardy nature."
