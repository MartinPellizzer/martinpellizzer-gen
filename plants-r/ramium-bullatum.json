It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems and small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces tiny, oval-shaped fruits called achenes, which are often covered in fine hairs. Ramium bullatum is typically found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal medicine."
