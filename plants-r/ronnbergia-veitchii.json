    "intro": "Ronnbergia veitchii, commonly known as the Veitch's torch orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its vibrant orange-red flowers with a distinctive torch-like shape. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are elongated and grass-like, often forming a rosette pattern around the base. Due to its rarity and unique appearance, Ronnbergia veitchii is highly valued in horticulture and conservation efforts."
