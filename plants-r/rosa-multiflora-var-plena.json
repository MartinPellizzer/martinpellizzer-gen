    "intro": "Rosa multiflora var. plena, commonly known as the double-flowered multiflora rose, is a cultivar of the multiflora rose, which is native to East Asia. It is characterized by its dense, bushy growth habit and its profuse blooming of double flowers, which have multiple layers of petals. The plant is evergreen in warmer climates and deciduous in colder regions, showcasing attractive foliage throughout the year. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to form thick hedges. However, it is considered invasive in some areas due to its rapid spread and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
