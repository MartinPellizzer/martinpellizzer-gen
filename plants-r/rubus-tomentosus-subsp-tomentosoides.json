It is characterized by its dense, white-tomentose (woolly) foliage and thorny stems. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black when mature. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or forested habitats. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
