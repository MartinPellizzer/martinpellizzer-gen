    "intro": "Rosa sulphurea var. multiplex, commonly known as the golden sand rose, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow flowers, which bloom in clusters and are often tinged with orange or red hues. The plant has woody stems that are covered in a dense layer of fine, hairy foliage, which helps it retain moisture in its harsh environment. Its leaves are narrow and linear, typically arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. This species is well adapted to dry conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
