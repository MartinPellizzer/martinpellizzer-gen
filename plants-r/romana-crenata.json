    "intro": "Romana crenata, commonly known as the wavy leaf plant, is a species of flowering plant in the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, wavy-edged leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, a typical feature of the Apiaceae family. Romana crenata is native to parts of Europe and Asia and is often found in moist, temperate environments. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
