It features showy, cup-shaped flowers with 5 to 15 petals, typically in shades of yellow, orange, or red. The plant has a short, stout stem that often branches near the top, supporting the bright blossoms. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three deeply lobed leaflets, and are covered in fine hairs. Ranunculus regelianus thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine landscapes."
