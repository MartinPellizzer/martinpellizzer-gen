It is characterized by its showy, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows as an evergreen shrub with dense, leathery leaves that are mid to dark green in color. It prefers acidic, well-drained soils and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes. Its ornamental value is largely due to its fragrant, showy blooms and compact growth habit."
