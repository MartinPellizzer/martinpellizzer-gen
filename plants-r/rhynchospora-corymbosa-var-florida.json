    "intro": "Rhynchospora corymbosa var. florida, commonly known as Florida marsh sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to the wetlands of the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of pale green to brown flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its botanical structure supports its role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
