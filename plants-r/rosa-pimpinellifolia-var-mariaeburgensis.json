    "intro": "Rosa pimpinellifolia var. mariaeburgensis, commonly known as the Mariaeburgensis rock rose, is a rare and ornamental shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, thorny stems, and clusters of small, fragrant pink or white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are typically trifoliate, with finely serrated edges, and the plant is well adapted to rocky and well-drained soils. It is often cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and unique floral display, though it remains a less common variety in horticultural collections. This variant is distinguished by its specific geographic origin and subtle differences in flower color and foliage compared to the typical Rosa pimpinellifolia."
