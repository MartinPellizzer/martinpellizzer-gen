    "intro": "Ricinus communis subvar. purpurascens, commonly known as the crimson or purple castor plant, is a variant of the castor oil plant characterized by its striking purplish foliage. This plant is native to tropical regions and thrives in warm, humid climates. Its leaves are large, palmately lobed, and often exhibit a vibrant purple hue, especially under full sun. The plant produces distinctive spiny capsules that contain toxic seeds, which are used in traditional medicine and as a source of castor oil. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been cultivated for both aesthetic and practical purposes."
