    "intro": "Rauvolfia nukuhivensis, commonly known as the Hawaiian rauvolfia, is a member of the Apocynaceae family and is native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a climbing shrub characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink. The plant produces small, berry-like fruits that contain seeds surrounded by a fleshy, orange pulp. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
