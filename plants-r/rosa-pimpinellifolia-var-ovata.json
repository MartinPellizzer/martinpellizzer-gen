It features small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in spring. The plant has dark green, oval-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stems. It is well adapted to rocky and dry environments, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping. Its ornamental value comes from its delicate flowers and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
