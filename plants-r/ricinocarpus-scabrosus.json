    "intro": "Ricinocarpus scabrosus, commonly known as the rough-leafed ricin tree, is a tropical plant belonging to the family Euphorbiaceae. It is characterized by its woody structure and palm-like leaves that are often covered in a rough, scaly texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers followed by distinctive, spiny fruits containing toxic seeds. It is native to parts of Southeast Asia and is known for its potential medicinal properties. However, it is also noted for containing toxic compounds, making it a plant of both interest and caution."
