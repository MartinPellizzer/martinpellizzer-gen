    "intro": "Romulea requienii var. parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered romulea, is a striking bulbous perennial plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its compact, grass-like foliage and clusters of delicate, bell-shaped flowers. The blooms, typically ranging in color from pale yellow to orange, are produced in late summer and early autumn. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its unique flower structure and ability to bloom reliably under suitable conditions."
