It is characterized by its glabrous, or smooth, leaf surfaces and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed sites such as tundra and rocky slopes. Its botanical features include narrow, grass-like leaves and spikelets that are often clustered at the ends of the stems. This variety is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments."
