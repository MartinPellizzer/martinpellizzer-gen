    "intro": "Rhynchospora gracillima subsp. gracillima, commonly known as the slender beak sedge, is a perennial herb native to wetland and marsh habitats in North America. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm, with narrow, grass-like leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets. The plant produces triangular, three-angled fruiting structures called nutlets, which are characteristic of the Cyperaceae family. It thrives in saturated soils and is often found in areas with standing water or frequent flooding. Due to its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils, it is an important component of these ecosystems."
