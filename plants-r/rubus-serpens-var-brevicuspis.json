    "intro": "Rubus serpens var. brevicuspis, commonly known as the short-hair raspberry, is a species of bramble native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and small, trifoliate leaves with short, stiff hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, red berries that are typically edible and have a tart flavor. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
