    "intro": "Ritchiea balbi, commonly known as the Balbi's cycad, is a rare and ancient plant belonging to the Cycadaceae family. It is native to the island of New Caledonia, where it grows in humid, forested environments. The plant has a stout, unbranched trunk that is often covered in a fibrous, spongy material. Its leaves are pinnate, with a feathery appearance, and it produces cones rather than flowers. Due to its restricted habitat and threats from deforestation, Ritchiea balbi is considered endangered and is protected in its native region."
