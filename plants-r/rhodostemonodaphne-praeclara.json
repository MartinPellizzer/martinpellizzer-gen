    "intro": "Rhodostemonodaphne praeclara, commonly known as the golden-flowered daphne, is a rare and striking plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of fragrant, yellow-orange flowers that bloom during the wet season. The plant belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is known for its unique floral structure, which includes a brightly colored cupule surrounding the true flowers. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species in its native range."
