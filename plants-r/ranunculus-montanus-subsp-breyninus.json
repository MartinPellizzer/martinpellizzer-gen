    "intro": "Ranunculus montanus subsp. breyninus, commonly known as the Alpine buttercup, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers with five petals and a hairy, glandular stem. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, often in mountainous areas. Its leaves are palmately lobed and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens despite its challenging growth requirements."
