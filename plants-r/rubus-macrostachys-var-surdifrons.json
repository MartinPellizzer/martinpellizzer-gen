It is characterized by its large, thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated margins. The plant produces aggregate fruits composed of numerous small, dark purple to black drupes. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in moist, shaded environments. Due to its vigorous growth, it can become invasive in certain areas outside its native range."
