    "intro": "Raphanistrum segetum, commonly known as the field millet or wild wheatgrass, is a flowering plant in the grass family Poaceae. It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows in disturbed soils and along field edges. The plant has slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are arranged in spikelets, and it produces small, dry fruits called caryopses. Raphanistrum segetum is often considered a weed but has potential for use in forage and erosion control."
