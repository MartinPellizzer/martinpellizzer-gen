The plant produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often appearing in spring. It thrives in cool, moist, acidic soils and is often found in high-altitude forests and alpine meadows. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
