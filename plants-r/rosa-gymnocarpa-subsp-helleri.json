    "intro": "Rosa gymnocarpa subsp. helleri, commonly known as the Heller's naked-seed rose, is a rare subspecies native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its thornless stems and simple, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy underside. The flowers are typically pink to reddish in color, with five petals and a prominent, hairy central style. This subspecies produces small, round, naked seeds that are dispersed by wind, a unique adaptation for its alpine habitat. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and hardy nature in cooler climates."
