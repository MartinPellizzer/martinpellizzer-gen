    "intro": "Rapuntium glabrifolium var. mundianum, commonly known as the smooth-leafed rapuntium, is a variant of the rapuntium plant characterized by its smooth, lance-shaped leaves. It is native to specific regions in South America, particularly in the Andean foothills. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by spherical, greenish fruits. Its leaves are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, and the plant is adapted to grow in rocky, well-drained soils. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
