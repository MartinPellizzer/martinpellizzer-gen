    "intro": "Rubus lucrosus, commonly known as the blackberry bramble, is a thorny shrub native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant produces edible berries that ripen to a dark purple or black color, often used in jams and pies. It thrives in moist, woodland habitats and is known for its vigorous growth and ability to spread through runners. The plant's botanical features make it both a valuable food source and an invasive species in some regions."
