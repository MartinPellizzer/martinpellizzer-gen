    "intro": "Rumex obtusifolius subsp. subalpinus, commonly known as Alpine broadleaf sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to alpine and subalpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered with a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in loose clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in mountain meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its hardy nature, it is well adapted to cold climates and can tolerate frost and low light conditions."
