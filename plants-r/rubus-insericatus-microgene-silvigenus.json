    "intro": "Rubus insericatus microgene silvigenus, commonly known as the silverleaf blackberry, is a shrub native to temperate regions of Asia. It features dark, thorny stems covered in a dense layer of silvery-white hairs, which give it its distinctive appearance. The leaves are compound, with three to five leaflets that are elliptical and have a finely serrated margin. Its flowers are small, white to pinkish, and appear in clusters, followed by edible berries that are typically dark purple to black. This plant thrives in woodland edges and shaded areas, preferring moist, well-drained soils."
