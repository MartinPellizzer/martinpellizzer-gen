    "intro": "Ranunculus rotundifrons, commonly known as the round-leaved buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It features a basal rosette of rounded, palmate leaves that are typically hairy and have a distinctive waxy coating. The plant produces showy yellow flowers with five broadly spreading sepals, lacking true petals. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
