    "intro": "Rubus serpens subsp. napophiloides, commonly known as the creeping blackberry, is a perennial shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and thornless stems, which allow it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, edible berries that are typically dark red to black in color. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a serrated margin, while the flowers are white and clustered in inflorescences. This subspecies is often found in moist, sandy soils along the edges of swamps and in wetlands."
