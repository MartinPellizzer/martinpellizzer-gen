It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in acidic, well-drained soils and thrives in partial to full shade. Its leaves are evergreen, leathery, and arranged in whorls around the stem. This species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in cooler, moist climates."
