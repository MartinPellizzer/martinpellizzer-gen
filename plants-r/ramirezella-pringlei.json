It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants such as buckwheat and sorrel. The plant is characterized by its delicate, clustered inflorescences and small, often greenish or reddish flowers. It typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky slopes, adapting to the harsh environmental conditions of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
