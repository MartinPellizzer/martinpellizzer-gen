    "intro": "Rosa tomentosa var. varians, commonly known as the woolly rose or variable woolly rose, is a shrub-like plant native to parts of Asia, including China and the Himalayas. It is characterized by its dense, woolly gray foliage and fragrant pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters and has thorny stems, which are a common feature in many rose species. Its leaves are usually compound, with multiple leaflets that are covered in a fine, fuzzy layer. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is well-suited to temperate climates."
