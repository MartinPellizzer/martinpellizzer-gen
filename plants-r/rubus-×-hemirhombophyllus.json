    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 hemirhombophyllus, commonly known as the Himalayan blackberry, is a hybrid plant species originating from the cross between Rubus ellipticus and Rubus parvifolius. It is characterized by its thorny stems and dense, mat-forming growth habit, which allows it to thrive in a variety of soil types. The plant produces large, dark purple to black berries that are rich in antioxidants and commonly used in culinary applications. It is native to the mountainous regions of Asia, particularly the Himalayas, and is well adapted to temperate climates. Due to its vigorous growth and fruit production, it is both a valued agricultural crop and an invasive species in some regions."
