    "intro": "Rhododendron plebeium, commonly known as the purpleleaf rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage that displays a striking purple hue, particularly on the underside of the leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soil and prefers cool, moist climates with partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
