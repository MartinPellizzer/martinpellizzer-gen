    "intro": "Rosa canina f. falsa, commonly known as the false dog rose, is a botanical variant of the dog rose. It is characterized by its smaller, often yellowish flowers compared to the typical red blooms of Rosa canina. The plant typically grows as a shrub with thorny stems and pinnately compound leaves. Its fruits, known as hips, are similar in appearance to those of the common dog rose but may differ in size and color. This subspecies is often found in woodland edges and rocky soils across Europe."
