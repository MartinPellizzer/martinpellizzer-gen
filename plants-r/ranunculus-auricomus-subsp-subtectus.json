    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus subsp. subtectus, commonly known as the shieldleaf buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It features distinctive yellow flowers with five broadly ovate petals that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The leaves are palmately divided with a waxy coating, and the plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as stream banks and forest floors. It is characterized by its short, stout rhizomes and produces small, smooth-seeded fruits. This subspecies is often found in association with other moisture-loving plants in its native environment."
