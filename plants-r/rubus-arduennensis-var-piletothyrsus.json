    "intro": "Rubus arduennensis var. piletothyrsus, commonly known as the Arduennes bramble, is a variant of the Arduennes blackberry, native to specific regions of Central America. It is characterized by its dense, thorny growth habit and dark purple to black berries that ripen in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest understories, preferring well-drained, loamy soils. Its foliage consists of trifoliate leaves with serrated edges, and it produces pale yellow flowers in early spring. This variant is valued for both its ornamental qualities and its role in local ecosystems."
