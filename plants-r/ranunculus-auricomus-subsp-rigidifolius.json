    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus subsp. rigidifolius, commonly known as the rigid-leaved buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features showy yellow flowers with five petal-like sepals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The subspecies is distinguished by its stiff, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
