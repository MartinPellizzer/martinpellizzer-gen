    "intro": "Rosa canina f. subattenuata, commonly known as the attenuated dog rose, is a botanical variant of the common dog rose, characterized by its elongated, slender petals. It typically features pale pink to white flowers with a delicate fragrance, blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has thorny stems and heart-shaped leaves, typical of the Rosa genus. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun, making it suitable for hedgerows and garden borders. This form is often noted for its more open growth habit compared to the typical Rosa canina."
