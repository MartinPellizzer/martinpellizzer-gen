    "intro": "Rhododendron nudipes f. kyushumontanum, commonly known as the Kyushu mountain rhododendron, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern Japan. It features broad, leathery leaves that are dark green and densely packed, providing a lush backdrop for its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The blooms, which are typically pink to reddish in color, appear in early spring and are borne in clusters along the stems. This variety is well adapted to acidic, well-drained soils and thrives in partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its dense foliage and long-lasting floral display."
