    "intro": "Rosularia adenotricha subsp. chitralica, commonly known as the Chitral rosebush, is a member of the Rosaceae family and is native to the high-altitude regions of northern Pakistan. It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial shrub with dense clusters of small, fleshy, pinkish-red leaves. The plant produces showy, solitary flowers with five petals, typically in shades of white to pale pink. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
