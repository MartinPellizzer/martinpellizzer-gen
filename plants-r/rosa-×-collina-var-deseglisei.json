    "intro": "Rosa \u00d7 collina var. deseglisei, commonly known as the Desert Rose or Desert Banksia, is a hybrid shrub native to the arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with dense, rounded foliage that is often covered in fine, silvery hairs. The plant produces showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Rosa \u00d7 collina var. deseglisei is well-suited for xeriscaping and thrives in full sun with minimal water requirements."
