    "intro": "Ranunculus inconcinnus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features delicate, yellow flowers with five petals and a hairy, upright stem. The plant has palmately divided leaves that are typically narrow and deeply lobed. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
