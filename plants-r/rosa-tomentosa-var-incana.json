    "intro": "Rosa tomentosa var. incana, commonly known as the woolly rose or the fuzzy shrub rose, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, grayish-white pubescence covering the stems, leaves, and flowers, which gives it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink to red, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are elliptical with serrated edges and are covered in fine, soft hairs. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively hardy, thriving in well-drained soil and full sun."
