    "intro": "Ricinocarpos villosus var. intermedius, commonly known as the woolly thornwood, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, thorny growth and hairy foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its thorny structure, it is sometimes used as a living fence or for erosion control."
