    "intro": "Rudbeckia flexuosa, commonly known as the zigzagged coneflower, is a North American native plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive, zigzagging stems and bright yellow to orange flower heads that resemble small cones. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a hairy texture, while the flowers bloom from late summer into early fall. Rudbeckia flexuosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing nectar for pollinators."
