    "intro": "Railliardia molokaiensis, commonly known as the Molokai marsh orchid, is a rare and endangered flowering plant native to the island of Molokai in Hawaii. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, small, and delicate orchid-like flowers. The plant typically grows in wetland or marshy habitats, where it thrives in the moist, nutrient-rich soils. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, it is critically endangered, making conservation efforts essential for its survival. Its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements make it a significant species for studying island endemism and ecological adaptation."
