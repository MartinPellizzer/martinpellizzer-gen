    "intro": "Racosperma neurocarpum, commonly known as the narrow-leafed wattle, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, often zigzagging stems and bipinnate leaves. The plant produces yellow pea-like flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, woody pods containing seeds. It is typically found in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its ornamental value and ability to fix nitrogen, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and for soil stabilization."
