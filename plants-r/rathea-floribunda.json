    "intro": "Rathea floribunda, commonly known as the golden bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has lanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Rathea floribunda thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period and low maintenance requirements."
