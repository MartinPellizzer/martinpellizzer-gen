It features thorny stems and dark green, ovate leaves with serrated margins. The plant produces clusters of small, pale pink to white flowers in late spring to early summer. Its foliage remains dense and attractive throughout the growing season. It is well-suited for rock gardens and coastal landscapes due to its drought tolerance and hardiness."
