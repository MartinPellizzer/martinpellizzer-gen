    "intro": "Rhinanthus obscurus, commonly known as the common yellow rattle, is an annual flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom from June to August, typically in dry grasslands and open habitats. The plant has slender, branching stems and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. Rhinanthus obscurus plays an important role in promoting biodiversity by stimulating the growth of surrounding grasses through its parasitic behavior."
