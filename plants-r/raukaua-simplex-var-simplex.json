    "intro": "Raukaua simplex var. simplex, commonly known as the silver tree, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its silvery, fuzzy leaves that reflect light and help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. It is a member of the Proteaceae family, which includes many plants adapted to nutrient-poor soils. This species is often found in coastal and inland regions, thriving in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils."
