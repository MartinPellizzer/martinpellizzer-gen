    "intro": "Racosperma inceanum subsp. conforme, commonly known as the coastal wattle, is a shrub native to the eastern coast of Australia. It is characterized by its yellow floral spikes and pinnate leaves, which are typical features of the legume family. The plant thrives in sandy or coastal soils and is often found in dune environments. It plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for local wildlife. Due to its resilience to salt spray and wind, it is sometimes used in coastal revegetation projects."
