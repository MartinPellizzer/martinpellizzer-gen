    "intro": "Rhamphicarpa ajugifolia, commonly known as the purple marsh orchid, is a flowering plant native to wetland and marsh habitats in the southeastern United States. It is a perennial herb with slender, erect stems that bear lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces dense clusters of small, violet or purple flowers, which are typically arranged in a spike-like inflorescence. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to thrive in waterlogged soils, and it plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological significance in swamp and marsh environments."
