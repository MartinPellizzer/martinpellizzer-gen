    "intro": "Ranunculus palustris var. corsicus, commonly known as Corsican water buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, such as along riverbanks and in damp meadows. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with a waxy surface and bright yellow flowers with five petals. It produces small, greenish fruits that contain several seeds. This variant is distinguished by its slightly smaller size and more compact growth compared to the typical Ranunculus palustris."
