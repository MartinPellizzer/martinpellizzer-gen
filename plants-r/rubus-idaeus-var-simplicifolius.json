It is characterized by its simple, lobed leaves that differ from the typical compound leaves of other raspberry varieties. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are similar in appearance to the common raspberry. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its edible berries. This variety is valued for its hardiness and potential for use in both culinary and ornamental settings."
