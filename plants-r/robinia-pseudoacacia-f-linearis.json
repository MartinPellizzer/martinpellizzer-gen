It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically narrower than those of the typical species. The plant is native to the southeastern United States and is often found in woodland edges and open areas. Its flowers are small, yellow, and clustered in racemes, producing a distinctive, fragrant scent. The bark is smooth and grayish, becoming fissured with age, and the plant is known for its rapid growth and adaptability to various soil types."
