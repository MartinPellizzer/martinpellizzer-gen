    "intro": "Rhynchosia capitata, commonly known as the \"cowpea\" or \"yardlong bean,\" is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and South America. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and compound leaves with small, ovate leaflets. The plant produces clusters of yellow, pea-like flowers that give way to elongated, green pods containing edible seeds. Rhynchosia capitata is a legume, meaning it has the ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic bacteria in its root nodules. It is often cultivated for its nutritious seeds, which are rich in protein and used in various cuisines."
