    "intro": "Rhinanthus crista-galli var. glaber, commonly known as the naked brome or glabrous common tickseed, is a flowering plant in the family Plantaginaceae. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is typically found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It has smooth, hairless leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits. This variety is often confused with other Rhinanthus species due to its similar appearance."
