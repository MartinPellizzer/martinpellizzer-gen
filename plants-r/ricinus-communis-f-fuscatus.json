    "intro": "Ricinus communis f. fuscatus, commonly known as the black leaf castor, is a variant of the castor oil plant characterized by its dark, almost black foliage. This cultivar is notable for its striking contrast between the dark leaves and the typical orange or red flowers of the species. The plant is a tropical shrub that can grow up to several meters in height, featuring hairy stems and spiny leaves. It produces unique seed capsules that split open to release toxic seeds, which contain ricin, a potent toxin. Despite its hazardous seeds, the plant is cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its dramatic appearance."
