    "intro": "Rubus corylifolius var. balticus, commonly known as the Baltic blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to eastern Europe and parts of Russia. It is characterized by its dark purple to black berries, which are typically larger and more elongated than those of the common blackberry. The plant produces trifoliate leaves with serrated edges, and its thorny stems are often covered in fine, white hairs. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils. The berries are used in jams, wines, and traditional foods, and the plant has some medicinal uses in folk remedies."
