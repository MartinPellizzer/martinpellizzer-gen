    "intro": "Ranunculus cymbalaria f. microphyllus, commonly known as the small-leaved water crowfoot, is a aquatic or semi-aquatic plant characterized by its finely divided, often floating leaves. It typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, and its leaves are small, heart-shaped, and arranged in a rosette. The plant produces yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom from spring to summer. It is native to parts of Europe and Asia and is often found in wetlands, ditches, and along the edges of ponds. This variety is distinguished by its reduced leaf size compared to the typical form of Ranunculus cymbalaria."
