    "intro": "Rubus saxatilis var. spinulosus, commonly known as the bristly blackberry, is a perennial shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and dark green, lobed leaves that are often covered in fine, bristly hairs. The plant produces small, aggregated fruits that ripen to a dark purple or black color, typically in late summer. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated for its edible berries and ornamental value."
