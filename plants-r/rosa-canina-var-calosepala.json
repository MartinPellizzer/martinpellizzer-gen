    "intro": "Rosa canina var. calosepala, commonly known as the silky rose or woolly dog rose, is a variant of the dog rose characterized by its soft, fuzzy sepals. This plant is native to parts of Europe and Asia, often found in woodland edges and scrub habitats. Its flowers are typically pink to red, with five petals and a distinctive, hairy calyx. The shrub produces hips, which are the fruit, and these are often used in herbal remedies. The botanical features of this variety make it a notable species in both horticulture and ecological studies."
