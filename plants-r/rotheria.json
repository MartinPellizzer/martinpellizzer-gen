    "intro": "Rotheria, commonly known as the silverleaf plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its silver-gray leaves, which are covered in fine, soft hairs. The flowers are typically small and clustered, often in terminal or axillary inflorescences. Rotheria species are native to regions of southern Africa and are adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. These plants are often used in traditional medicine and as ornamental plants due to their attractive foliage."
