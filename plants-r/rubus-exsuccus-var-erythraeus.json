    "intro": "Rubus exsuccus var. erythraeus, commonly known as the red-fruited bramble, is a shrub native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, red, edible berries that ripen in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky soils and scrublands. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and its flowers are white with five petals. The berries are often used in jams and wines due to their tart flavor and high acidity."
