    "intro": "Rumex \u00d7 gentilis, commonly known as the broad-leaved dock, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Rumex obtusifolius and Rumex crispus. It is characterized by its large, broad, arrow-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is commonly found in meadows, waste areas, and along roadsides. Rumex \u00d7 gentilis is a perennial herb that can spread through both seeds and rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in various habitats."
