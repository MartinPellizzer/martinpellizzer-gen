It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and fleshy, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on long, slender pedicels. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated as a houseplant or in hanging baskets."
