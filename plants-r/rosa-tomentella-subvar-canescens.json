    "intro": "Rosa tomentella subvar. canescens, commonly known as the woolly shrub rose, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, grayish-white pubescent foliage and clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. Its stems are woody and often covered in a thick layer of fine, white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
