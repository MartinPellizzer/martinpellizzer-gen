It is characterized by its distinctive, wavy-edged leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by reddish-brown, triangular seed pods. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in wet meadows. Curly dock is known for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally for its astringent and anti-inflammatory effects."
