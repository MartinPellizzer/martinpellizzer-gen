    "intro": "Rubus praecox f. praecox, commonly known as the early blackberry, is a shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and prickly stems, with trifoliate leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in the spring, followed by edible blackberries that ripen in late summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and thickets. This variety is valued for both its ornamental appeal and its fruit, which is used in culinary and commercial applications."
