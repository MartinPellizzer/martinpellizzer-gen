    "intro": "Ranunculus ololeucos, commonly known as the white buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features delicate, showy flowers with five white petals and a yellow center, typically blooming in early spring. The plant has a basal rosette of heart-shaped leaves and produces slender, hairy stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Its botanical name reflects its historical association with the Greek word for \"butter,\" due to its yellow center resembling butter."
