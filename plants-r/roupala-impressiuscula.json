    "intro": "Roupala impressiuscula, commonly known as the narrow-leaf roupala, is a small evergreen shrub native to the eastern regions of South Africa. It typically grows in coastal and mountainous areas, preferring well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade. The plant is characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves that are often adorned with distinctive white or silver markings. Its small, pale yellow flowers appear in spring, followed by dark blue berries that are a food source for birds. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
