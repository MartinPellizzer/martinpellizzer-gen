    "intro": "Romulea flava var. minor, commonly known as the lesser yellow orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its striking yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, forming a basal rosette, while its flowers are borne on tall, slender stalks. This variant is distinguished by its smaller flowers and more compact growth compared to the typical form of Romulea flava."
