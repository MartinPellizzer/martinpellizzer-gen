It is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, with thorny stems and compound leaves. The plant produces aggregate fruits, known as berries, which are dark purple to black in color when mature. These berries are edible and have a tart flavor, often used in jams and pies. The plant is adapted to a variety of soil types and thrives in full sun to partial shade."
