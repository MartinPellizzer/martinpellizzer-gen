    "intro": "Ricinus purpurascens, commonly known as the purple-cup castor oil plant, is a striking member of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its unique, spiky, reddish-purple bracts that encase its small yellow flowers. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain toxic seeds, which are used in traditional medicine and as a source of castor oil. Its foliage is large, palmately lobed, and often has a velvety texture. Ricinus purpurascens is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been cultivated in botanical gardens and as a landscape plant in warm climates."
