    "intro": "Rumicastrum arenicola, commonly known as the sand dune spurge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to coastal regions of North America. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dune ecosystems where it plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. It is adapted to harsh coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. Its presence is an indicator of healthy, undisturbed coastal habitats."
