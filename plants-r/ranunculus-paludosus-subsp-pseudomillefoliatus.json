    "intro": "Ranunculus paludosus subsp. pseudomillefoliatus, commonly known as the marsh buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It features delicate, usually yellow flowers with five to seven petals, and its leaves are typically divided into lobes, resembling those of a fern. The plant thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in marshes, wet meadows, and along the edges of ponds. It is characterized by its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed wetland areas. The subspecies pseudomillefoliatus is distinguished by its more finely divided leaves compared to the typical form of R. paludosus."
