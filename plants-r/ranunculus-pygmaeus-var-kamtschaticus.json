    "intro": "Ranunculus pygmaeus var. kamtschaticus, commonly known as the Kamtschatka dwarf buttercup, is a small, herbaceous perennial native to the coastal regions of the Russian Far East. It features delicate, bright yellow flowers with five to seven petals, typically less than 2 centimeters in diameter. The plant grows in moist, sandy soils along rocky shores and has a low, spreading growth habit. Its leaves are trifoliate, with finely divided lobes, and it is often found in coastal habitats where it tolerates salt spray and strong winds. This variety is closely related to other ranunculus species but is distinguished by its unique geographic distribution and compact morphology."
