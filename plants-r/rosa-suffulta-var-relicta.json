    "intro": "Rosa suffulta var. relicta, commonly known as the relic rose, is a rare and ancient variety of the rose family. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense, dark green foliage. The plant produces fragrant, semi-double pink flowers that bloom in late summer. Native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. Due to its limited distribution and historical significance, it is considered a valuable species for botanical study and conservation efforts."
