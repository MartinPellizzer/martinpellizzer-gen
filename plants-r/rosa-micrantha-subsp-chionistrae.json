    "intro": "Rosa micrantha subsp. chionistrae, commonly known as the alpine rose, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant produces oval, hairy leaves with a serrated margin, typical of many rose species. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with similar climatic conditions."
