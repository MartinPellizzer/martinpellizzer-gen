    "intro": "Rebutia colorea, commonly known as the rainbow cactus, is a species of cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and vibrant, colorful flowers that range from yellow to red. The plant has thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. Its leaves are typically modified into spines, providing protection from herbivores. Rebutia colorea is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
