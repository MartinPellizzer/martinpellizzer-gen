    "intro": "Rueppelia, commonly known as the mountain rue, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rutaceae. These plants are native to southern Africa, particularly in regions with arid or semi-arid climates. Rueppelia species are typically shrubs or small trees, characterized by their aromatic leaves and small, fragrant flowers. They often have smooth, greyish bark and are adapted to thrive in rocky or well-drained soils. The genus includes several species, some of which are used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
