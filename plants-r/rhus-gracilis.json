    "intro": "Rhus gracilis, commonly known as slender sumac, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in partial to full sun. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, fuzzy berries in the fall. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a serrated edge, often turning bright red in the autumn. Rhus gracilis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to provide habitat for wildlife."
