It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces aggregate fruits, which are typically dark red to black in color and have a tart, slightly sweet flavor. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its edible berries. The plant's botanical features make it a popular choice for both ornamental and culinary purposes."
