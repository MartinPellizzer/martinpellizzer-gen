    "intro": "Relbunium ciliatum, commonly known as the silky sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Europe and northern Africa. It is a low-growing perennial herb with slender stems and small, clustered leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are typically linear and have a distinctive ciliate margin, giving it its scientific name. Relbunium ciliatum is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
