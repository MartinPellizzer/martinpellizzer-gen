    "intro": "Rosa canina var. mitis, commonly known as the sweet briar rose, is a variant of the dog rose that is native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is a shrub characterized by its thorny stems and fragrant, pink to white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, red, hairy fruits called hips, which are rich in vitamin C and used in traditional medicine. Its leaves are compound, with five to seven leaflets, and it thrives in well-drained soil in full sun. The sweet briar rose is also valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in hedgerows and gardens."
