    "intro": "Rotang maximus, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a tropical tree native to Central and Southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, dark reddish-brown heartwood that is highly valued for its durability and fine grain. The plant has a straight trunk and can grow up to 30 meters tall, with broad, palmate leaves that are often used for shade. Its flowers are small and fragrant, typically white or pale yellow, and it produces small, round fruits containing winged seeds. Due to overharvesting, Rotang maximus is now listed as an endangered species in many regions."
