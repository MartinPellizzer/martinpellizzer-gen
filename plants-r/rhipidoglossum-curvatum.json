    "intro": "Rhipidoglossum curvatum, commonly known as the curved tongue fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive, curved fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense, fibrous root system that helps anchor it in place. The leaves are usually leathery and have a unique, elongated shape that sets it apart from other fern species."
