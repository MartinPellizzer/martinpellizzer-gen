    "intro": "Rubus viridis var. atrocaulis, commonly known as the black-stemmed bramble, is a variant of the green bramble species native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dark, almost black stems and leaves that are typically serrated with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters, which are followed by edible, raspberry-like fruits. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils. Due to its vigorous growth, it can become invasive in certain environments."
