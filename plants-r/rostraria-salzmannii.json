    "intro": "Rostraria salzmannii, commonly known as the Salzmann's rostraria, is a rare and unique plant species belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated, and often curved fruit structure, which resembles a beak or a nose, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, preferring well-drained soils and cool climates. Its leaves are finely divided and aromatic, similar to other members of the carrot family. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Rostraria salzmannii is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
