    "intro": "Rhododendron dauricum var. sempervirens, commonly known as the Daurian evergreen rhododendron, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It features broad, leathery leaves that remain green throughout the growing season, providing year-round foliage. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, pink to white flowers in early spring, which are followed by elliptical, dark blue berries. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. This variety is valued for its hardiness and ornamental appeal in temperate climates."
