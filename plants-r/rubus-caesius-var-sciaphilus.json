    "intro": "Rubus caesius var. sciaphilus, commonly known as the shadow raspberry, is a rare variant of the common raspberry found in shaded, forested environments. It produces small, dark red berries that are typically smaller than those of the standard Rubus caesius. The plant has compound leaves with serrated edges and thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its flowers are usually pale pink and appear in clusters, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to its limited habitat, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
