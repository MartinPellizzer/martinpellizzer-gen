It is characterized by its dense, grayish-white pubescence that covers its stems and leaves, giving it a soft, velvety appearance. The plant produces fragrant, semi-double pink to red flowers in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are compound, with ovate to elliptic leaflets that are often hairy beneath. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal and fragrance."
