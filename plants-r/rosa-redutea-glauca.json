    "intro": "Rosa redutea glauca, commonly known as the glaucous rose, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its pale blue to white flowers and fuzzy, bluish-gray foliage. Native to certain regions of Asia, this plant typically grows in woodland or scrub habitats. The leaves are simple and alternate, with a distinctive waxy coating that gives them their characteristic glaucous appearance. It produces small, aggregate fruits known as rose hips, which are important for seed dispersal."
