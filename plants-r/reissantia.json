    "intro": "Reissantia, commonly known as the sacred lotus, is a striking aquatic plant native to tropical regions. It features large, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and red, often floating on the water's surface. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that provide shade and support for aquatic life. Its roots are submerged, absorbing nutrients from the water while anchoring the plant. Reissantia is revered in many cultures for its symbolic and medicinal properties."
