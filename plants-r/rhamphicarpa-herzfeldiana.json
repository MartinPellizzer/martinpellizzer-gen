It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and showy, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant is adapted to survive in dry environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems and leaves. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain seeds dispersed by wind. Due to its unique appearance and hardiness, it is often cultivated in xeriscapic gardens."
