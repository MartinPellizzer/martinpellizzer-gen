It typically grows in rocky, alpine, or subalpine habitats, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant features basal leaves that are palmately lobed and showy yellow flowers with five petals. It is characterized by its short stature and hairy stems, which help it withstand harsh environmental conditions. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
