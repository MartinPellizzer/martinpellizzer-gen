    "intro": "Rosa montana var. crepinii, commonly known as the Crepin's shrub rose, is a compact, deciduous shrub native to central and eastern Europe. It features upright, thorny stems and clusters of small, fragrant pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has dark green, glossy leaves that provide a lush backdrop to its showy blooms. It is well-suited for rock gardens or as a border plant due to its hardiness and ornamental value. Rosa montana var. crepinii is also valued for its resistance to common rose diseases."
