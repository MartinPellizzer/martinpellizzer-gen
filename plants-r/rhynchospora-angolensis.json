    "intro": "Rhynchospora angolensis, commonly known as the Angola sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes grass-like plants known as sedges. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy environments, such as swamps and riverbanks, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its slender, triangular stems are often clustered, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets. Rhynchospora angolensis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
