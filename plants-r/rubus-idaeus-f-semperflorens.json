    "intro": "Rubus idaeus f. semperflorens, commonly known as the everblooming raspberry, is a cultivar of the red raspberry plant. It is characterized by its continuous flowering and fruiting throughout the growing season, unlike typical raspberries that have a more limited bloom period. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red, though some varieties may exhibit other colors. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, making it suitable for cultivation in temperate climates. This form is prized for its ornamental value and extended harvest period."
