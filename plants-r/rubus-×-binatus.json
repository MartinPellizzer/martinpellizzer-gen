    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 binatus, commonly known as the blackberry raspberry, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between blackberries (Rubus ursinus) and raspberries (Rubus idaeus). It exhibits characteristics of both parent species, with thorny stems and aggregate fruits that are typically red to black in color. The plant is deciduous, shedding its leaves in autumn, and thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, and it produces fruit in the summer months. The hybrid is valued for its culinary uses, particularly in jams and desserts, due to its sweet and tart flavor profile."
