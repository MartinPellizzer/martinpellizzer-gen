    "intro": "Rhododendron lancifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Asia, particularly in China, Korea, and Japan. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy, with a leathery texture. The plant produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to red, often appearing in late spring to early summer. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Rhododendron lancifolium is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its fragrance."
