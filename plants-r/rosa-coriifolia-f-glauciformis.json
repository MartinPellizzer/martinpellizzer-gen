    "intro": "Rosa coriifolia f. glauciformis, commonly known as the glaucous form of the Chinese rose, is a compact shrub characterized by its distinctive, thornless stems and clusters of fragrant, pale pink to white flowers. The leaves are ovate to elliptical, with a slightly hairy surface that gives them a soft, velvety texture. This variety is noted for its unique glaucous (bluish-gray) hue on the leaf surfaces, which sets it apart from the typical green foliage of other Rosa species. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. The plant is also valued for its winter hardiness and ability to bloom reliably in cooler climates."
