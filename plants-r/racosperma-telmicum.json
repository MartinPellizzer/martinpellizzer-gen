    "intro": "Racosperma telmicum, commonly known as the coastal acacia, is a shrub native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often prostrate stems and bipinnate leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in racemes, which are typically followed by slender, woody pods. It is well adapted to saline and sandy soils, making it a common sight in coastal dunes and maritime environments. Racosperma telmicum plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for small insects and birds."
