    "intro": "Rubus hebecarpos microgene subriglandulosus, commonly known as the small-fruited bramble, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its thorny stems and small, aggregate fruits. The leaves are typically trifoliate, with serrated margins, and the plant produces white to pale pink flowers in the spring. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies in its native habitat. The subspecies is distinguished by its subrugose (slightly rough) surfaces and reduced glandular structures."
