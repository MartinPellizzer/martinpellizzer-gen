    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus subsp. hallstaensis, commonly known as the Hallstaen's buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central and Eastern Europe. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and rocky slopes. The plant features palmately divided leaves and produces showy, yellow flowers with five petals. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated sepals that resemble small leaves. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, this subspecies is considered endangered in many parts of its range."
