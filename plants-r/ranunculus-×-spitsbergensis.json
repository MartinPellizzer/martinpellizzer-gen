It features showy, cup-shaped flowers in a range of colors including yellow, orange, and red, often with a dark center. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are typically hairy and adapted to cold climates. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for alpine gardens. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in rock gardens and as a border plant in colder regions."
