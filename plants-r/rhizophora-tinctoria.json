    "intro": "Rhizophora tinctoria, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a species of mangrove tree native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its extensive root system, which includes prop roots that help stabilize the tree in tidal waters. The plant has small, simple leaves that are often covered in a waxy layer to reduce water loss. It produces small, white flowers that are pollinated by insects, followed by dark purple or black berries containing seeds. This species plays a vital role in coastal ecosystems by preventing erosion and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms."
