    "intro": "Robinia breviloba, commonly known as the dwarf false acacia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and have a distinctive grayish-green color. The plant produces fragrant, yellowish-white flowers in racemes during the spring, which are attractive to pollinators. Its bark is smooth and light gray, becoming fissured with age, and it has a shallow, spreading root system. Robinia breviloba is often found in sandy soils and is adapted to coastal and inland dune environments."
