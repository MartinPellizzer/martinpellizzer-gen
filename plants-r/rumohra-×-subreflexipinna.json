    "intro": "Rumohra \u00d7 subreflexipinna, commonly known as the hybrid fern, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Rumohra adiantiformis and Rumohra filix-mas. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically light green with a subtle sheen. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in humid, shady environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardens."
