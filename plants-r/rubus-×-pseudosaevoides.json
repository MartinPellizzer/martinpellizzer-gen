    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 pseudosaevoides, commonly known as the blackberry raspberry hybrid, is a deciduous shrub belonging to the Rosaceae family. It is a natural hybrid between Rubus ursinus (blackberry) and Rubus idaeus (raspberry), resulting in a plant with unique botanical characteristics. The plant typically has thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. Its flowers are usually pink or white, and the fruit is a aggregate of small drupes, often resembling both blackberries and raspberries. This hybrid is valued for its ornamental appeal and edible fruits, though it can be somewhat invasive in certain regions."
