    "intro": "Rhamnus uninervis, commonly known as the single-veined buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters, featuring upright, often spiny stems and alternate, simple leaves with a single prominent vein. The leaves are usually elliptical or ovate, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and they turn yellow in the fall. It produces small, greenish flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by dark blue-black berries that are attractive to birds. The plant is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
