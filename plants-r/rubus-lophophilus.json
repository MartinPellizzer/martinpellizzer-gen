    "intro": "Rubus lophophilus, commonly known as the woolly blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and thorny stems, which provide protection against herbivores. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black in color. Its flowers are usually pink or white, and they bloom in early summer. Rubus lophophilus thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forest understories."
