    "intro": "Rubus moluccanus var. paniculatus, commonly known as the Moluccan raspberry, is a shrub native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically trifoliate or pinnate, and its clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant produces edible berries that are similar in appearance to raspberries but have a distinct flavor. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is cultivated in some regions for both horticultural and culinary purposes."
