    "intro": "Ranunculus cymbalaria f. exilis, commonly known as the slender water crowfoot, is a aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, featuring delicate, floating or submerged leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually finely divided and may appear as thread-like structures. This variety is characterized by its reduced size compared to the typical Ranunculus cymbalaria, with shorter stems and smaller flowers."
