    "intro": "Rapistrum scabrum, commonly known as rough hawksbeard, is an annual flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many other well-known flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its rough, hairy leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. It typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Rapistrum scabrum is often considered a weed but has been studied for its potential in phytoremediation due to its ability to absorb heavy metals."
