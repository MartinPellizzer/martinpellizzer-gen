    "intro": "Rumex dimorphophyllus, commonly known as the two-leaf sorrel, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive leaves, which are divided into two different shapes on either side of the stem, giving it its scientific name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are edible and have a tangy, sour flavor due to the presence of oxalic acid. It is also noted for its small, greenish flowers that appear in clusters during the spring and summer months."
