    "intro": "Ranunculus pendulus, commonly known as the hanging buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features delicate, nodding flowers with five to eight yellow petals and a hairy, yellow center, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has finely divided, feathery leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and stream banks. Ranunculus pendulus is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its charming appearance."
