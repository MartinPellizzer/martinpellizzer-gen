    "intro": "Rumex spinosus, commonly known as prickly sorrel, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its serrated, spiny leaves and bright yellow flowers that appear in early spring. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are edible but contain oxalic acid, which can be toxic in large quantities. The plant is often used in traditional medicine for its purported diuretic and anti-inflammatory properties."
