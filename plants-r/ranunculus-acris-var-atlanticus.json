    "intro": "Ranunculus acris var. atlanticus, commonly known as the Atlantic meadow buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to coastal regions of North America. It features showy yellow flowers with 5 to 15 sepals that resemble petals, and it typically grows in moist, sandy soils along dunes and tidal flats. The plant has a basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves with distinctive veins and hairy surfaces. It is adapted to salt spray and wind exposure, making it a resilient species in harsh coastal environments. Its botanical characteristics make it an important component of coastal ecosystems and a subject of ecological study."
