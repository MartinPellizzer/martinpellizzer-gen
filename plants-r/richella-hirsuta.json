It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, with a central disc surrounded by ray florets. Richella hirsuta is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to full sun exposure."
