    "intro": "Racosperma striatifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to Australia and is characterized by its slender, often zigzagging stems and small, narrow leaves with a distinctive striated pattern. The plant produces yellow pea-like flowers, which are typically arranged in racemes, contributing to its common name. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal or semi-arid regions. Racosperma striatifolium is a hardy shrub that plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native wildlife."
