    "intro": "Reseda tomentosa, commonly known as woolly reseda, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a perennial herb with hairy, gray-green foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are often covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Reseda tomentosa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental qualities and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
