    "intro": "Railliardia demissifolia var. dolichophylla, commonly known as the long-leaf railliardia, is a rare and striking orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, often with a subtle purple hue at the base. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
