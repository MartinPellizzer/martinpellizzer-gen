    "intro": "Restrepia limbata, commonly known as the dwarf lady's slipper orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and features a single, small, greenish-white flower with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often among mosses and lichens on forest floors. Its leaves are usually broad and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native habitat. Restrepia limbata is valued for its unique floral structure and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental appeal."
