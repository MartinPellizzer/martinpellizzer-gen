It is characterized by its narrow, elliptic leaves and small, dark purple to black berries. The plant typically grows in woodland areas and along stream banks, preferring moist, well-drained soils. Its flowers are white and appear in clusters, and the fruit develops from the fertilized flowers. This form is notable for its distinct leaf shape and is often found in shaded environments."
