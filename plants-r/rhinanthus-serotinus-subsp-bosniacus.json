    "intro": "Rhinanthus serotinus subsp. bosniacus, commonly known as the Bosnian yellow rattle, is a flowering plant native to the Balkan region. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients through its root system. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Its subspecific name, *bosniacus*, reflects its geographical origin in Bosnia and Herzegovina."
