    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus subsp. firmulus, commonly known as the yellow avens, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers with five petals and a prominent central stigma, which are typically 1\u20132 inches in diameter. The plant features trifoliate leaves with serrated edges, and its stems are often hairy. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The subspecies firmulus is distinguished by its more robust growth and slightly different leaf morphology compared to the typical form of R. auricomus."
