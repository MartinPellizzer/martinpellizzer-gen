    "intro": "Rebutia nigricans var. albispina, commonly known as the white-spined rebutia, is a member of the Cactaceae family native to South America. It is a low-growing, compact cactus with short, cylindrical stems that are often ribbed and covered in white spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking contrast to its green foliage. Its succulent nature allows it to store water efficiently, making it well adapted to arid environments. It is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation due to its hardiness and ornamental appeal."
