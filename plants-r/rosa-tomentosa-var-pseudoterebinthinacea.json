    "intro": "Rosa tomentosa var. pseudoterebinthinacea, commonly known as the hairy rose or the Turkish rose, is a shrub native to the eastern Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, grayish-white pubescence covering its stems and leaves, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically pink to red in color, blooming in the spring. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets, and the plant is often cultivated for ornamental purposes. It is relatively drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils."
