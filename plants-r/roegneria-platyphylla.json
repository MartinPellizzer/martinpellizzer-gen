    "intro": "Roegneria platyphylla, commonly known as the flatleaf wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, flat blades that are typically less than 1 inch in width. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers, which are often tinged with green or reddish hues. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to temperate climates with cold winters. Roegneria platyphylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil."
