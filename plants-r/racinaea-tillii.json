    "intro": "Racinaea tillii, commonly known as the Till's racinaea, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Central America. It is characterized by its unique, elongated inflorescence and strikingly colored, intricate flowers that display a blend of purple and green hues. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree bark and drawing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its leaves are elongated and leathery, adapted to the humid, shaded conditions of its natural habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Racinaea tillii is considered a conservation concern."
