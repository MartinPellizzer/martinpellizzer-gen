    "intro": "Rupicapnos numidica subsp. caput-plataleae, commonly known as the Algerian mountain heath, is a shrub native to the Maghreb region of North Africa. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of small, tubular flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in sunny, well-drained environments. Its leaves are leathery and aromatic, often used in traditional medicine. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable in some areas."
