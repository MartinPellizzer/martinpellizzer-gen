    "intro": "Rosa fedtschenkoana var. lageniformis, commonly known as the Himalayan rose, is a rare and endangered species native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dark red to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has woody stems and produces small, elliptical leaves with a hairy texture. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its mountainous habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat loss, it is considered a conservation priority."
