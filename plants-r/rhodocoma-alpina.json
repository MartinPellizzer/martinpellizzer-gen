    "intro": "Rhodocoma alpina, commonly known as the alpine rhodocoma, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its erect, branching stems and clusters of small, tubular flowers. The plant typically blooms in spring, producing vibrant pink to purple flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Rhodocoma alpina thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, harsh alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
