    "intro": "Rosa pomifera var. engadinensis, commonly known as the Engadine rose, is a rare and unique species native to the Swiss Alps. It is characterized by its large, edible, apple-like fruit called a \"pomme de rose,\" which is both ornamental and historically significant. The plant produces fragrant, pink to white flowers in early summer, followed by the development of its distinctive fruit. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is typically found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
