    "intro": "Rumex \u00d7 theflungii, commonly known as the hybrid sorrel, is a naturally occurring hybrid between Rumex acetosa (common sorrel) and Rumex acetobipinus (broad-leafed sorrel). It is characterized by its distinctive leaves, which are typically heart-shaped with a reddish or purple coloration on the veins. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, and it thrives in moist, shady environments. It is often found in woodland areas and along stream banks, where it can spread through both sexual and vegetative means. Due to its ornamental appeal and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain regions."
