    "intro": "Rhododendron viscosum f. hispidum, commonly known as the hairy alpine azalea, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of eastern North America. It features dense, dark green, leathery leaves that are covered in fine, fuzzy hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of showy, pinkish-white to pale red flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in cool, moist, acidic soils and partial to full shade, making it well-suited for woodland gardens. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is often cultivated in specialty gardens and conservation efforts."
