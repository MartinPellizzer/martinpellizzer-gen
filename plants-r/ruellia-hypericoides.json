    "intro": "Ruellia hypericoides, commonly known as the creeping ruellia, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy and have a slightly rough texture. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple, blooming from late spring to early fall. Ruellia hypericoides thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and woodland edges. Its rapid growth and spreading habit make it an effective ground cover in shaded or partially sunny environments."
