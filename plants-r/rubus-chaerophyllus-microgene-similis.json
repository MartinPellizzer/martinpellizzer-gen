    "intro": "Rubus chaerophyllus microgene similis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dark purple to black berries, which are typically small and have a tart flavor. The plant has compound leaves with serrated edges and produces white or pale pink flowers in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
