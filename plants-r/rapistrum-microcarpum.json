    "intro": "Rapistrum microcarpum, commonly known as the dwarf cress, is a small annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of about 10\u201330 centimeters and has small, alternate leaves that are oval to lance-shaped. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in racemes, followed by small, rounded pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in fields, along roadsides, and in wet meadows. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
