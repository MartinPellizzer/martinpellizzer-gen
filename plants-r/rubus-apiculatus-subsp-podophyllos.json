    "intro": "Rubus apiculatus subsp. podophyllos, commonly known as the purple-leaf bramble, is a shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its thorny stems and trifoliate leaves that often display a striking purple or reddish hue. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in the spring, followed by edible, red berries in the summer. It thrives in woodland edges and moist soils, and is often found in the understory of deciduous forests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
