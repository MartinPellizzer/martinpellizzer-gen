    "intro": "Rosularia sempervivoides, commonly known as the stonecrop, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features rosettes of fleshy, waxy leaves that are typically blue-green in color, adapted to store water and withstand drought. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the summer months. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it an ideal plant for arid and semi-arid climates."
