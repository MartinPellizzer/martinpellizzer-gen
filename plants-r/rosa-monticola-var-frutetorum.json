    "intro": "Rosa monticola var. frutetorum, commonly known as the Alpine rose or mountain rose, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and clusters of fragrant, semi-double pink or white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in well-drained, rocky soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets with a slightly serrated edge. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in cooler climates."
