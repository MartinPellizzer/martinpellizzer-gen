    "intro": "Rhododendron chaetomallum var. chamaephytum, commonly known as the dwarf rhododendron, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It features dense, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and elliptical in shape. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Due to its compact size and ornamental value, it is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover in shaded landscapes."
