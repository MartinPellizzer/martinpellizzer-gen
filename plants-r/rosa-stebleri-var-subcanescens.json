    "intro": "Rosa stebleri var. subcanescens, commonly known as the silver-haired rose, is a compact shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features small, pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a delicate touch to its foliage. The plant is characterized by its silvery-gray, hairy leaves that give it its common name and provide a striking contrast to its pink blooms. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and unique foliage texture."
