    "intro": "Rubus valligenus, commonly known as the alpine raspberry, is a species of bramble native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and produces small, edible berries that are typically red or yellow in color. The plant has compound leaves with serrated edges and produces white or pink flowers in the spring. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and alpine settings."
