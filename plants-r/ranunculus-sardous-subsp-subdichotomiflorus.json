    "intro": "Ranunculus sardous subsp. subdichotomiflorus, commonly known as the Sardinian crowfoot, is a rare and endemic species found primarily in the Mediterranean island of Sardinia. It is characterized by its delicate, trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish flowers with five petals. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as mountainous regions and forested areas. Its botanical features include a short, stout rhizome and a basal rosette of leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
