It features small, oval leaves that are densely covered in white to greyish woolly hairs, giving it a distinctive, fluffy appearance. The plant produces small, pale pink to white flowers in late spring to early summer. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. It is relatively hardy and thrives in well-drained soil with full sun to partial shade."
