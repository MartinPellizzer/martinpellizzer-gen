It features basal leaves that are arrow-shaped, with a distinctive narrow, pointed tip, and rough, serrated edges. The plant produces tall, erect flowering stems that bear small, greenish-white flowers in dense clusters. It thrives in moist, rich soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and disturbed areas. Its botanical characteristics make it a common weed in agricultural and riparian habitats."
