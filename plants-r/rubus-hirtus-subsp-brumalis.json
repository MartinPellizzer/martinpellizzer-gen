    "intro": "Rubus hirtus subsp. brumalis, commonly known as the winter raspberry, is a shrub native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, aggregate fruits that ripen in late summer to early autumn. The plant produces white to pale yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by the development of its edible berries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or along stream banks. This subspecies is notable for its ability to survive cold temperatures, making it a hardy component of temperate ecosystems."
