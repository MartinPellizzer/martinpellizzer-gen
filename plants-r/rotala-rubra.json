    "intro": "Rotala rubra, commonly known as red waterwheel plant, is a species of aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of bright red to orange-red leaves, which give it its striking visual appeal.

Rotala rubra is popular in aquariums due to its vibrant color and ease of maintenance."
