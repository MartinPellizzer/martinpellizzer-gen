    "intro": "Ranunculus repens f. hirsutus, commonly known as the hairy creeping buttercup, is a low-growing perennial plant characterized by its hairy stems and leaves. It typically thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies. The plant produces showy yellow flowers with numerous petals, which bloom in early spring. Its hirsute (hairy) foliage distinguishes it from other ranunculus species. This variant is well adapted to wet environments and is often used in wetland restoration projects."
