    "intro": "Ridleyandra flammea, commonly known as the flameback or flame-barked tree, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, flame-like bark that peels off in thin, papery layers, revealing a bright orange or red inner surface. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree, reaching heights of up to 15 meters. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a glossy appearance. Ridleyandra flammea is valued for its ornamental bark and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a landscape plant."
