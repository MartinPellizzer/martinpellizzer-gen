    "intro": "Rosa abietina f. typica, commonly known as the Alpine rose, is a rare and frost-resistant shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dark green, leathery leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun exposure. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a botanically significant species within the Rosa genus."
