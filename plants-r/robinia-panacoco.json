    "intro": "Robinia panacoco, commonly known as the false acacia, is a deciduous leguminous tree native to the southeastern United States. It features compound leaves with oval-shaped leaflets and produces fragrant, yellowish-white flowers in spring. The tree is characterized by its strong, woody thorns and is often found in open woodlands and along riverbanks. Its seeds are encased in pod-like fruits that split open to release the seeds. The plant has a deep root system and is known for its ability to fix nitrogen, improving soil fertility."
