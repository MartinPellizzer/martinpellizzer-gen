    "intro": "Rosa tomentosa var. littoralis, commonly known as the coastal rose, is a shrub native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and clusters of fragrant pink flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to salt-laden air and coastal winds. Its leaves are typically covered in a fine white tomentum, which helps reduce water loss. This species is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
