It features delicate, yellow flowers with 5 to 15 sepals that are often mistaken for petals. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a hairy texture that distinguishes it from other varieties. The species is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive, early spring blooms."
