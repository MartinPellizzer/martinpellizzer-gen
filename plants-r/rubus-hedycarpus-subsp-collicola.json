    "intro": "Rubus hedycarpus subsp. collicola, commonly known as the alpine blackberry, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is a shrub that typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or alpine habitats. The plant produces small, dark berries that are edible, though they are not as commonly cultivated as other Rubus species. Its leaves are usually trifoliate, with a hairy texture, and the plant has a robust root system adapted to harsh climates. The subspecies is notable for its resilience to cold temperatures and its role in local ecosystems."
