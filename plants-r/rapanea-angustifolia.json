It features dense, glossy, dark green leaves that are typically narrow and elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by red, fleshy berries. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its compact growth habit and attractive foliage. Rapanea angustifolia prefers well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it suitable for garden borders and hedges."
