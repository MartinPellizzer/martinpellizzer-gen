    "intro": "Rosa vosagiaca var. asperifolia, commonly known as the roughleaf rose, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and compound leaves with a rough, hairy texture. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of pink to red, typically in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in horticulture."
