    "intro": "Rumex hydrolapathus, commonly known as water sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features alternate, broadly ovate leaves with a waxy coating and prominent veins, often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are borne on slender, branching stalks. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats."
