    "intro": "Rubus obsessus, commonly known as the torment weed, is a species of bramble native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its prickly stems and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces red, edible berries that are often used in jams and desserts. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its aggressive growth habit makes it a common invasive species in certain regions."
