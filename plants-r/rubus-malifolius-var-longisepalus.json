    "intro": "Rubus malifolius var. longisepalus, commonly known as the long-sepaled blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to certain regions of Asia. It is characterized by its dark purple to black berries, which are typically larger and more elongated than those of the standard Rubus malifolius. The plant produces compound leaves with serrated edges and has a thorny stem structure typical of the Rubus genus. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, with five sepals that are notably elongated, giving it its specific epithet. This variety is valued for its culinary use, particularly in jams and desserts, due to its rich flavor and firm texture."
