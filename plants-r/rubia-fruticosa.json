    "intro": "Rubia fruticosa, commonly known as woodruff, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe, western Asia, and northwestern Africa. It is characterized by its creeping, woody stems and fragrant, small white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces small, dark blue berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Rubia fruticosa is valued for its aromatic properties and has been used in traditional herbal medicine and as a flavoring agent."
