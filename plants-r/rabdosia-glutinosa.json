    "intro": "Rabdosia glutinosa, commonly known as sticky rabdosia, is a perennial herb native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which includes many aromatic plants. The plant is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in a sticky resin. It produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, arranged in whorled clusters. The sticky resin exudes from the leaves and stems, giving the plant its common name and contributing to its unique ecological interactions."
