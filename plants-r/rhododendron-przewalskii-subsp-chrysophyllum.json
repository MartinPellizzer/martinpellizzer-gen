    "intro": "Rhododendron przewalskii subsp. chrysophyllum, commonly known as the golden-leaved rhododendron, is a rare and ornamental plant native to the Himalayas and parts of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its striking golden-yellow foliage, which contrasts beautifully with its deep red or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude forests and shrublands, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are leathery and evergreen, providing year-round interest in the landscape. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable species for botanical study and conservation efforts."
