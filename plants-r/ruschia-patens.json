    "intro": "Ruschia patens, commonly known as the spreading ruschia, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is a low-growing, succulent perennial that thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. The plant features fleshy, upright stems and produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange. It is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its compact growth habit. Ruschia patens is drought-tolerant and requires minimal maintenance once established."
