    "intro": "Rubus rigidus var. chrysocarpus, commonly known as the golden-fruited blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dark, thorny stems and clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early summer. The fruit, which is typically a dark red to black berry, is notable for its distinctive golden coloration on the surface. This plant thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges or shaded areas. Its botanical features make it a unique subject for both horticultural study and ecological research."
