It features erect, hairy stems that bear palmately divided, bright yellow flowers with 5-7 lobes. The leaves are trifoliate or pinnately divided, with serrated margins, and are covered in fine, silky hairs. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. This subspecies is notable for its ornamental value and is cultivated in gardens for its striking, early spring blooms."
