    "intro": "Rosa viscaria var. scopulorum, commonly known as the rock rose, is a perennial shrub native to the rocky habitats of the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. The plant produces rose-like blooms in late spring to early summer, which are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are dark green, leathery, and arranged in odd-pinnate patterns, contributing to its ornamental appeal. This hardy species is well adapted to poor, well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
