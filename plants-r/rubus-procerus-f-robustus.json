    "intro": "Rubus procerus f. robustus, commonly known as the robust raspberry, is a variant of the trailing blackberry species native to South America. It is characterized by its vigorous growth habit and thorny stems, which help it climb and spread across various substrates. The plant produces aggregate fruits composed of small, dark red drupes that are typically harvested when fully ripe. Its leaves are palmately lobed, with a rough texture and a fragrant aroma when crushed. This form is valued for its hardiness and potential use in both ornamental and culinary applications."
