    "intro": "Robinia undulata, commonly known as the wavy-leaf false acacia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which have a wavy or undulating margin, giving it its common name. The plant produces fragrant, yellowish-white flowers in racemes during the spring, followed by pod-like fruits that contain seeds. Its bark is thick and fissured, often appearing rough and flaky. Robinia undulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping due to its hardiness and adaptability."
