    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 nudiflorens, commonly known as the nakedflower bramble, is a hybrid species within the Rubus genus, characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves. It is native to parts of Europe and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that appear before the leaves in early spring. Its fruits, known as blackberries, are edible and commonly used in culinary applications. Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural and natural settings."
