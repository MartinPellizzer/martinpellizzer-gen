    "intro": "Robbairea major, commonly known as the giant flame vine, is a striking tropical climbing plant native to parts of South America. It is characterized by its large, showy, flame-colored flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. The plant has heart-shaped, velvety leaves that are often used in traditional medicine by indigenous communities. Its rapid growth habit and vigorous vines make it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. However, due to its invasive potential, it is often considered a weed in certain regions."
