    "intro": "Rosa micrantha var. coquozii, commonly known as the Coquoz's rose, is a rare and delicate species native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant has slender, thornless stems and lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forested areas at high altitudes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
