    "intro": "Rhus semialata var. purpurea, commonly known as purpleleaf sumac, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically bright green on top and purple underneath, giving it its distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by red, fuzzy berries that are a food source for birds. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in disturbed soils along roadsides and in open woodlands. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping and erosion control."
