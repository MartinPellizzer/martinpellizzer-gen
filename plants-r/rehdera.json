    "intro": "Rehdera, commonly known as the \"tropical orchid,\" is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia, where they thrive in humid, warm climates. Rehdera species typically feature showy, fragrant flowers with intricate patterns and vibrant colors, often in shades of white, yellow, and pink. They are epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants without being parasitic, often found in forest canopies. Their botanical significance lies in their ornamental value and their role in biodiversity within their native ecosystems."
