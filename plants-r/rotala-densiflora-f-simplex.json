    "intro": "Rotala densiflora f. simplex, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water lettuce, is a variant of the water lettuce species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and narrow, waxy leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant thrives in shallow freshwater environments and is often found in ponds, lakes, and slow-moving rivers. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually appearing in clusters near the water's surface. This plant is valued in aquatic gardening for its ornamental appeal and ability to help control algae growth in water features."
