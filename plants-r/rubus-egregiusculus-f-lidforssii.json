    "intro": "Rubus egregiusculus f. lidforssii, commonly known as the small evergreen raspberry, is a rare and compact shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, edible berries that ripen in late summer. The plant is notable for its evergreen nature, which allows it to retain its leaves year-round, making it a unique addition to gardens in mild climates. Its botanical features include small, bracteate flowers and a generally dwarf growth habit, which makes it suitable for container cultivation. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
