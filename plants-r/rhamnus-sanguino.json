It is native to parts of Europe and Asia, where it typically grows in woodlands and along stream banks. The plant is characterized by its small, oval leaves and clusters of yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring. Its fruit is a small, smooth, and usually red or orange drupe, which ripens in late summer. Rhamnus sanguino is often used in traditional medicine for its purported digestive and anti-inflammatory properties."
