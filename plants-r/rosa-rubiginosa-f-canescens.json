    "intro": "Rosa rubiginosa f. canescens, commonly known as the gray rose or silver rose, is a shrub-like plant native to southern Europe and parts of the Middle East. It is characterized by its pale pink to white flowers and its distinctive silvery-gray foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant has thorny stems and is often found in rocky or dry habitats. It is a member of the Rosaceae family and is valued for its ornamental qualities. The foliage and flowers are covered in a fine, powdery coating that helps reduce water loss in arid environments."
