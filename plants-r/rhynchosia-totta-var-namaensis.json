It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and distinctive seed pods. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are often clustered together. Its seeds are encased in hard, spiny pods, which help in seed dispersal by attaching to animal fur or clothing. This species is adapted to arid environments and is often found in sandy or rocky soils."
