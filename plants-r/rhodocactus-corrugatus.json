    "intro": "Rhodocactus corrugatus, commonly known as the corrugated rhodocactus, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of Mexico. It features a cylindrical stem covered with distinctive, ridged, and corrugated patterns that give it its common name. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically borne at the top of the stem. It is adapted to survive in dry conditions with minimal water requirements. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
