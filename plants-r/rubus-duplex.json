    "intro": "Rubus duplex, commonly known as the double blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its dark purple to black berries, which are typically smaller than those of other Rubus species. The plant has compound leaves with three to five leaflets, and its stems are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The fruit is edible but can be tart, and it is sometimes used in local foraging traditions."
