It is characterized by its upright, often sparsely branched stems and small, dandelion-like leaves. The flowers are typically yellow and arranged in a composite head, with both ray and disk florets. Rigidella species are often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands. They are generally herbaceous perennials, though some species may be annual."
