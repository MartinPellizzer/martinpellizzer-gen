    "intro": "Rhododendron taxifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of East Asia, including China, Korea, and Japan. It is characterized by its dark green, elliptical leaves that are narrow and leathery, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces showy clusters of bell-shaped flowers, typically in shades of pink, red, or white, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers cool, moist climates with partial shade. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and landscapes where it adds vibrant color to the early spring flora."
