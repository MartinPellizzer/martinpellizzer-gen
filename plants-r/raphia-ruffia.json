    "intro": "Raphia ruffia, commonly known as the African fan palm, is a large, robust palm native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of large, fan-shaped leaves that can reach several meters in diameter. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers followed by elongated, three-lobed fruits that contain a single seed. Raphia ruffia is adapted to grow in wet, swampy areas and is often used for its strong, fibrous leaves in traditional crafts. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
