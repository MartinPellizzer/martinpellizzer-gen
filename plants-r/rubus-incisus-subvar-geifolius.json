    "intro": "Rubus incisus subvar. geifolius, commonly known as the alpine blackberry, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, thorny stems and trifoliate leaves with deeply incised lobes. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black in color. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its hardy nature, it is adapted to cold climates and can survive in harsh environmental conditions."
