    "intro": "Randia audasii, commonly known as the redroot sandcherry, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States. It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, often found in coastal areas. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and often have a slightly rough texture. Randia audasii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in coastal landscaping due to its salt tolerance."
