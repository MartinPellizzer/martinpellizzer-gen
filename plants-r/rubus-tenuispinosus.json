    "intro": "Rubus tenuispinosus, commonly known as the slender-spined blackberry, is a species of brambles native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its thin, spiny stems and small, dark purple to black berries. The plant typically grows in moist, wooded areas and thrives in partial to full shade. Its foliage consists of trifoliate leaves with serrated edges, and it produces white or pale pink flowers in the spring. The fruit is edible, though often tart, and is used in jams and pies in some regions."
