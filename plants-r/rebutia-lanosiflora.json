    "intro": "Rebutia lanosiflora, commonly known as the woolly rebutia, is a species of cactus native to South America, specifically Brazil. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are covered in dense, woolly white hairs, which help to reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically borne on short, branched inflorescences. It is a slow-growing, compact plant that thrives in well-draining soil and full sun. Due to its unique appearance and ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a decorative cactus in arid gardens and collections."
