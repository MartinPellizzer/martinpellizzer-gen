    "intro": "Rhodorhiza fruticulosa, commonly known as the coral root orchid, is a flowering plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is a small, herbaceous perennial that lacks chlorophyll and relies on mycorrhizal associations with fungi for nutrients. The plant produces delicate, pink or white flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It is native to the eastern United States and thrives in moist, shaded environments. Due to its specialized growth habits, it is often found in forest understories and is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
