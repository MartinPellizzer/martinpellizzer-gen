    "intro": "Rawsonia lucida, commonly known as the white-flowered rock rose, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in coastal or mountainous regions. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine, white or greyish coating, which helps reduce water loss. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and visual interest."
