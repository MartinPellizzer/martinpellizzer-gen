    "intro": "Ranunculus nivalis subsp. sulphureus, commonly known as the sulphur yellow buttercup, is a low-growing perennial herb native to alpine regions of Europe. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations, often found in mountain meadows and scree slopes. The plant produces bright yellow flowers with five broadly ovate petals, and its leaves are palmately divided into lobes. It is notable for its ability to withstand cold temperatures and is often among the first plants to emerge in spring. The subspecies is distinguished by its vibrant yellow coloration, which is more intense than that of the typical R. nivalis."
