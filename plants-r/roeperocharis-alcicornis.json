    "intro": "Roeperocharis alcicornis, commonly known as the woolly sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has succulent leaves that are covered in fine, woolly hairs, which help reduce water loss in its dry habitat. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in rocky outcrops or along coastal dunes. Roeperocharis alcicornis is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low rainfall, making it a resilient species in harsh environments."
