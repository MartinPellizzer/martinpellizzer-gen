    "intro": "Reynosia cuneifolia, commonly known as the California buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 3 to 5 inches long and have a lance-shaped appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by dark blue, fleshy berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in chaparral and coastal scrub habitats. Reynosia cuneifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
