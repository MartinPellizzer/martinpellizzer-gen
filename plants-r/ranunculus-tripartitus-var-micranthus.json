    "intro": "Ranunculus tripartitus var. micranthus, commonly known as the small-flowered buttercup, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, yellow flowers with five petals and a distinctive, hairy stem. The leaves are typically trifoliate, meaning they are divided into three leaflets, which is a key identifying feature. This variant is smaller than the typical Ranunculus tripartitus, with more compact flowers and shorter stems. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks."
