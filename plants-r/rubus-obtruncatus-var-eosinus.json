    "intro": "Rubus obtruncatus var. eosinus, commonly known as the pink-fruited blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive pink to red berries, which are smaller and more acidic than typical blackberries. The plant has thorny stems and trifoliate leaves, typical of the Rubus genus. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, and it produces aggregate fruits composed of tiny drupes. This variety is often found in woodland edges and moist habitats, thriving in partial shade."
