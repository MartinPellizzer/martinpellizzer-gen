    "intro": "Rumex \u00d7 dobrogensis, commonly known as the Dobrogian sorrel, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Rumex acetosa (common sorrel) and Rumex acetobulus (broad-leaved sorrel). It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically reddish in color and covered with fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are borne on erect, branching stems. It thrives in moist, fertile soils and is often found in wet meadows and along riverbanks. Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits a range of morphological variations, making it a subject of interest in botanical studies."
