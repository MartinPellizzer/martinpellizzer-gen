    "intro": "Rottboellia maitlandii, commonly known as the maitland grass, is a tropical and subtropical annual grass species native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically arranged in a whorled pattern. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in dense spikelets, which are often wind-pollinated. Rottboellia maitlandii is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in full sun, making it a common weed in agricultural and urban settings. Its rapid growth and adaptability contribute to its widespread distribution in warm climates."
