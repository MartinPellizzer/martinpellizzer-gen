    "intro": "Racosperma excelsum subsp. angustum, commonly known as narrow-leaf wattle, is a member of the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod-bearing fruits. It is a shrub or small tree native to the tropical regions of northern Australia, particularly in the Northern Territory and Queensland. The plant features narrow, linear leaves and produces yellow flowers in globular clusters, typical of many wattles. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a deep root system that enables it to survive in poor soils. The subspecies angustum is distinguished by its narrower leaves compared to other subspecies of Racosperma excelsum."
