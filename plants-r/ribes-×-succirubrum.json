    "intro": "Ribes \u00d7 succirubrum, commonly known as the hybrid gooseberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is a cross between *Ribes sanguineum* (red gooseberry) and *Ribes velutianum* (blue gooseberry), resulting in a plant with distinctive botanical features. The leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have serrated margins, while the flowers are typically pink or red, with five petals. The fruit is a small, rounded berry that changes color from green to red or orange as it matures. This plant thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it a popular choice for ornamental and edible gardens."
