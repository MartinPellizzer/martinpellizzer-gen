It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and showy, bell-shaped flowers. The leaves are typically leathery and have a distinctive white or pale green venation, which sets it apart from other rhododendron species. The flowers, which are usually pink or white, bloom in late spring to early summer. This plant thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, forested habitats."
