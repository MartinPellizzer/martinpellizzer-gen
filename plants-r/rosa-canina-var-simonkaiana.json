    "intro": "Rosa canina var. simonkaiana, commonly known as the Hungarian rose, is a shrub native to Central Europe. It features thorny stems and pinnately compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces fragrant, pink to white flowers in the spring, which are followed by orange-red hips in the fall. These hips are edible and contain numerous seeds, making the plant valuable for both ornamental and ecological purposes. It is often found in open woodlands and along stream banks, thriving in well-drained soils."
