It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its climbing habit and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences. Its roots and stems contain alkaloids, which have been studied for potential medicinal properties. However, it is not widely cultivated or used in traditional medicine compared to other species in the Rauvolfia genus."
