    "intro": "Rubus scanicus, commonly known as the Swedish blackberry, is a species of bramble native to northern Europe. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, dark red to black berries. The plant typically grows in woodland edges, hedgerows, and moist soils, preferring temperate climates. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the flowers are white with five petals. The berries are edible, though often tart, and are used in local culinary traditions."
