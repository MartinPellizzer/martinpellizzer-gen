    "intro": "Robinia variegata, commonly known as the variegated false acacia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It features compound leaves with a distinctive variegated pattern of green and white, which adds ornamental value to gardens. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, typical of the Fabaceae family. Its flowers are usually pale yellow and appear in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The bark is smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age, and the plant is adapted to well-drained soils in full sun."
