    "intro": "Rhododendron primuliflorum, commonly known as the spring beauty rhododendron, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically produces bright pink to red blooms, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to form dense, evergreen foliage throughout the year."
