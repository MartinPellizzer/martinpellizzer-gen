    "intro": "Rebutia senilis var. aurescens, commonly known as the golden rebutia, is a compact, low-growing cactus native to South America. It features pale green to blue-gray stems that are often covered in white or pale blue spines. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically borne on short pedicels. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its slow growth rate and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and container cultivation."
