It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its striking yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and has a short, unbranched stem. Its flowers are typically borne in a single, terminal raceme and are often visited by pollinators such as bees and flies. Romulea luteiflora is adapted to grow in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in open grasslands."
