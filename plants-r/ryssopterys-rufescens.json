    "intro": "Ryssopterys rufescens, commonly known as the rusty-veined fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds with a distinctive rusty-brown coloration on the underside of the leaves. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, this plant thrives in humid, shaded environments. The fronds are typically narrow and elongated, with small, rounded pinnae that give it a finely textured appearance. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and conservation efforts in its native habitats."
