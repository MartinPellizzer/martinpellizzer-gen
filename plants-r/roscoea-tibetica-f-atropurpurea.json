    "intro": "Roscoea tibetica f. atropurpurea, commonly known as the purple-leafed roscoea, is a rhizomatous herbaceous plant native to the high altitudes of the Tibetan Plateau. It features striking, lance-shaped leaves that are typically a deep purple or reddish-purple in color, which distinguish it from the typical green foliage of the species. The plant produces showy, red-orange flowers in late summer, arranged in a spadix enclosed by a large, colorful spathe. It thrives in cool, moist environments and requires partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its unique foliage and dramatic floral display."
