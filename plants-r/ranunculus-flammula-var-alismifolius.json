    "intro": "Ranunculus flammula var. alismifolius, commonly known as the water buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and bright yellow flowers. It is native to wetlands and moist meadows in Europe and Asia, where it thrives in shallow water or damp soil. The plant's leaves are typically alternate and have a distinctive, almost lily-like appearance, contributing to its common name. Its flowers, which bloom in early spring, are usually solitary and have five petals. The species is noted for its ability to tolerate fluctuating water levels, making it an important indicator plant for wetland ecosystems."
