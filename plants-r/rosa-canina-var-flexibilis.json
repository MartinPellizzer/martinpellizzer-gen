    "intro": "Rosa canina var. flexibilis, commonly known as the dog rose or flexible rose, is a variant of the dog rose species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces fragrant pink or white flowers in spring, which give way to red, hairy fruits called hips in autumn. Rosa canina var. flexibilis is notable for its medicinal uses, particularly the hips, which are rich in vitamin C and used in herbal remedies. It thrives in well-drained soil and is often found in hedgerows and woodland edges."
