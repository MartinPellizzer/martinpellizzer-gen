It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in disturbed soils. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in warm climates."
