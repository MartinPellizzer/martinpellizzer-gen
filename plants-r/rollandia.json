    "intro": "Rollandia, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Rollandia is often found in wetlands and along riverbanks, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. It is also known for its ability to spread rapidly, making it an invasive species in some regions."
