    "intro": "Rhamnus elliptica, commonly known as the elliptic buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It typically grows to a height of 6 to 10 feet and features small, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by black, berry-like fruits that are toxic to humans and animals. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, and it is often found in moist woodland habitats. Rhamnus elliptica is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
