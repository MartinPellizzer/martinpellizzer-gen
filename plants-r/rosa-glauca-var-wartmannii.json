    "intro": "Rosa glauca var. wartmannii, commonly known as the Wartmann's blue rose, is a rare and ornamental species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. This variant is characterized by its pale blue to lavender-colored flowers, which bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows as a shrub with thorny stems and dark green, oval-shaped leaves. Its botanical features include dense, glandular hairs on the foliage and flowers that are often fragrant. Due to its limited distribution and unique coloration, it is highly valued in horticulture and botanical collections."
