    "intro": "Rhipsalis riocampanensis, commonly known as the Rio Campanense mistletoe cactus, is a unique epiphytic cactus native to Central America. It is characterized by its delicate, branched stems that often hang from trees, giving it a cascading appearance. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom during the rainy season, typically in the summer months. Its leaves are reduced to small, hair-like structures, and it relies on its host for support rather than soil. Rhipsalis riocampanensis is adapted to humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests."
