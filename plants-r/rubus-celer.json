    "intro": "Rubus celer, commonly known as the swift blackberry, is a species of bramble native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits known as berries, which are typically dark red to black in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight, often found in woodland edges and disturbed areas. Due to its hardy nature, Rubus celer is both ecologically significant and occasionally considered a weed in agricultural settings."
