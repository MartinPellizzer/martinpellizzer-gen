    "intro": "Rubus micans subsp. subrotundus, commonly known as the glossy blackberry, is a shrub native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and thorny stems, which help it cling to supports. The leaves are usually elliptical or ovate, with a glossy, dark green upper surface and a lighter, often hairy underside. Its flowers are small, white, and clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by dark purple to black berries. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its edible fruits."
