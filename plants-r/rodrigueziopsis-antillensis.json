    "intro": "Rodrigueziopsis antillensis, commonly known as the Antillean rodriguezia, is a rare flowering plant native to the Caribbean. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its palm-like appearance, with a stout, woody stem and large, palmately lobed leaves. It produces showy, yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
