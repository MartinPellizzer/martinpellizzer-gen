    "intro": "Rhus cismontana, commonly known as smooth sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and turn bright red in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in panicles, followed by red, fuzzy fruits that are an important food source for wildlife. Smooth sumac thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in open woodlands, fields, and along roadsides. It is also known for its ability to tolerate a variety of soil types and is relatively drought-resistant."
