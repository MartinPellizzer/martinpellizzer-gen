It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in the Pamir and Tien Shan ranges. The plant is characterized by its bright yellow, cup-shaped flowers with numerous stamens and a showy, hairy center. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a distinctive serrated edge. This variant is highly sought after by botanists and horticulturists due to its ornamental value and limited distribution."
