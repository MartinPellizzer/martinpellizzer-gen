    "intro": "Rhododendron aurigeranum, commonly known as the golden crown rhododendron, is a striking evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage that ranges from dark green to almost black, providing a lush backdrop for its showy flowers. The plant produces large, pendulous clusters of funnel-shaped blooms, typically in shades of pink to white, which appear in late spring to early summer. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and requires partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Due to its ornamental value and limited natural range, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and specialized collections."
