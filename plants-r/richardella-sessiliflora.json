    "intro": "Richardella sessiliflora, commonly known as the sessile-flower richardella, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
