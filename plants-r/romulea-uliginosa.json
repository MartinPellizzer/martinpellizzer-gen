    "intro": "Romulea uliginosa, commonly known as the bog romulea, is a perennial bulbous plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, showy flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in wet, acidic soils, often found in marshy areas or along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are grass-like and form a dense rosette, while its flowers are usually yellow or orange with a purple or brownish hue. Romulea uliginosa is adapted to moist environments and plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and nectar for pollinators."
