    "intro": "Rubia scandens, commonly known as creeping raspberry, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trailing stems that can root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground or climb over other plants. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are heart-shaped with a slightly hairy texture, and the plant is often found in woodland areas or along streambanks. Rubia scandens is also known for its use in traditional medicine and as a source of dye."
