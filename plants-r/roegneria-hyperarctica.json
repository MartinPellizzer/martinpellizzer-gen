    "intro": "Roegneria hyperarctica, commonly known as Arctic timothy, is a perennial grass species native to Arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in cold, nutrient-poor environments and is adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions. Roegneria hyperarctica plays a crucial role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for Arctic flora and fauna."
