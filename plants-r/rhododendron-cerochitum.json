    "intro": "Rhododendron cerochitum, commonly known as the alpine rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Asia, particularly in the Himalayas. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist climates with well-drained soil. The plant features broad, leathery leaves that are often dark green and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its flowers are usually pink or red, appearing in clusters and blooming in late spring to early summer. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in temperate regions."
