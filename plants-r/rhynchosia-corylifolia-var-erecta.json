It features large, palmately compound leaves with three to five leaflets, often with a distinctive heart-shaped base. The plant produces yellow, pea-like flowers that are followed by long, slender pods containing several kidney-shaped seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along forest edges. Its botanical characteristics make it an important species in ecological studies and traditional medicine."
