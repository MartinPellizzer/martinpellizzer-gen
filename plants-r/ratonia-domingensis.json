    "intro": "Ratonia domingensis, commonly known as the Dominican ratonia, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean island of Hispaniola. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, and has opposite, ovate leaves. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, and it produces small, dark berries as fruit. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
