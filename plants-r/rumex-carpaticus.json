    "intro": "Rumex carpaticus, commonly known as the Carpathian sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Carpathian Mountains. It features a robust rhizomatous root system and lance-shaped leaves with a reddish underside. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are edible and have a tart, sour flavor due to the presence of oxalic acid. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
