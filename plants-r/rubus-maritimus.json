    "intro": "Rubus maritimus, commonly known as the coastal raspberry, is a perennial shrub native to coastal regions of North America. It is characterized by its prickly stems and trifoliate leaves, which are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that ripen to a red color, often used in local foraging. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to salt spray and wind exposure. Rubus maritimus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing food for wildlife."
