    "intro": "Rubus eustephanos var. glanduliger, commonly known as the glandular blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is characterized by its thorny stems and dark, juicy berries that ripen in late summer. The leaves are typically compound, with three to five leaflets, and the plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in early spring. This variety is notable for its glandular hairs that cover its stems and leaves, giving it a distinctive texture and appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or shrubland habitats."
