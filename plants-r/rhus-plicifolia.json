It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and have a smooth, glossy surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by red, fuzzy berries that are a food source for birds and wildlife. Rhus plicifolia thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or along roadsides.
