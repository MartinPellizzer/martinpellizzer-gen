    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 argutispinus, commonly known as the thimbleberry, is a hybrid species within the Rubus genus, characterized by its distinctive thimble-shaped fruit. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are usually yellow to orange in color when ripe. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated margins, and the plant has prickly stems that provide some protection. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and edible fruits, though it is less commonly cultivated than other Rubus species."
