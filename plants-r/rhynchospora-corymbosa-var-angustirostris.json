    "intro": "Rhynchospora corymbosa var. angustirostris, commonly known as the narrow-beaked spike-rush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland environments in North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, characterized by its triangular stems and spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds, thriving in moist to saturated soils. Its flowers are small and clustered, with three stamens and a single pistil, typical of the sedge family. The variety angustirostris is distinguished by its narrow, elongated bracts and a more slender, pointed inflorescence compared to the typical form."
