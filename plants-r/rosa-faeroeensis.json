    "intro": "Rosa faeroeensis, commonly known as the Faeroese rose, is a rare and endemic species native to the Faroe Islands. It is a shrub-like plant with slender, thorny stems and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant's leaves are alternate, simple, and covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps protect it from the harsh coastal climate. Its flowers are typically pink or red, with five petals and numerous stamens, typical of the Rosaceae family. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Rosa faeroeensis is considered a vulnerable species."
