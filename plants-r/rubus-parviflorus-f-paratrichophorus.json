    "intro": "Rubus parviflorus f. paratrichophorus, commonly known as the pale-flowered blackberry, is a botanical variant of the blackberry plant. It is characterized by its smaller, pale pink to white flowers, which distinguish it from the more typical red or pink blooms of other Rubus species. The leaves are typically trifoliate, with a serrated margin, and the plant produces small, dark purple to black berries. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils. This form is of interest to botanists due to its unique floral morphology and genetic variation."
