    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 infestifrons, commonly known as the invasive blackberry, is a hybrid species within the Rubus genus. It is characterized by its thorny stems and aggregate fruits, which are typically dark purple to black in color. The plant is native to the eastern United States but has spread widely due to its aggressive growth habit. It thrives in a variety of soil types and can tolerate both full sun and partial shade. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets make it a significant ecological concern in many regions."
