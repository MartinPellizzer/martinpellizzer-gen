    "intro": "Racosperma cangaiense, commonly known as the Canga tree, is a species of leguminous plant native to the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. It is characterized by its deciduous habit, with compound leaves that are often trifoliate or pinnate. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, and it has a deep root system adapted to nutrient-poor soils. It plays an important ecological role in its habitat, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a threatened species in its native range."
