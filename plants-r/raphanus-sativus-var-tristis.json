    "intro": "Raphanus sativus var. tristis, commonly known as the black radish, is a biennial plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its dark purple or black skin and elongated, fleshy root that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which are typical of the mustard family. Its leaves are pinnately lobed and can be edible when young, though they are often less palatable than the root. This variety is cultivated for its root, which is used in various culinary and medicinal applications."
