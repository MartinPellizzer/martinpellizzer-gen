    "intro": "Ranunculus altifidus, commonly known as the alpine buttercup, is a flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its delicate, yellow flowers with numerous petals and a hairy, upright stem. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine meadows, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are palmately divided and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. Ranunculus altifidus is a member of the Ranunculaceae family, known for its showy flowers and often toxic compounds."
