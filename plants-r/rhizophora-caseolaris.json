    "intro": "Rhizophora caseolaris, commonly known as the mangrove apple or white mangrove, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rhizophoraceae. It is characterized by its distinctive pneumatophores, which are specialized root structures that help the plant breathe in waterlogged soils. The plant thrives in coastal areas, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions, where it plays a crucial role in stabilizing shorelines. Its small, yellowish flowers are followed by edible berries that provide food for various wildlife species. Rhizophora caseolaris is an important component of mangrove ecosystems, contributing to biodiversity and coastal protection."
