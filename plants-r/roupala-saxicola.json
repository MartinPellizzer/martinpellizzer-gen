    "intro": "Roupala saxicola, commonly known as the rock roupala, is a small evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and dark green, leathery leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by spherical, red berries. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
