    "intro": "Rhamnus senticosa, commonly known as the sticky buckthorn, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its small, oval leaves that are often covered in a sticky resin, giving the plant its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in the spring, which are followed by dark, fleshy berries in the fall. Its leaves and berries contain compounds that have been used in traditional medicine for their astringent properties. Rhamnus senticosa is adapted to harsh, arid environments and is often found in rocky or semi-desert habitats."
