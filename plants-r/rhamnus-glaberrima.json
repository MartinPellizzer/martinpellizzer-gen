    "intro": "Rhamnus glaberrima, commonly known as the smooth buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and small, elliptical leaves that are typically glossy on the upper surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, which are followed by dark blue berries that are edible for birds and mammals. Rhamnus glaberrima is often found in moist, well-drained soils in woodland edges and along streambanks. Its botanical features make it an important component of native plant communities and a valuable food source for wildlife."
