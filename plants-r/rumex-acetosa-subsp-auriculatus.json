    "intro": "Rumex acetosa subsp. auriculatus, commonly known as the auriculate sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its heart-shaped leaves with auriculate (ear-like) lobes at the base. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in the spring, which are borne on erect, leafy stems. Its leaves are edible and have a sour taste due to the presence of oxalic acid. The species is also noted for its ability to thrive in a variety of light conditions, from full sun to partial shade."
