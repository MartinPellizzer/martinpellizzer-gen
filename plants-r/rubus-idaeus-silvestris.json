It is characterized by its thorny stems, pinnately compound leaves, and aggregate fruits composed of small, bright red drupes. The plant typically grows in woodland edges, hedgerows, and disturbed soils, preferring partial shade to full sun. Its flowers are white or pale pink, and it produces edible berries that are rich in vitamin C and antioxidants. The plant is also valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in herbal medicine."
