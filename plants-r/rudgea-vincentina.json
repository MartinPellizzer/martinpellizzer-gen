    "intro": "Rudgea vincentina, commonly known as Vincent's rudgea, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or mountainous terrain, thriving in cool, humid climates. Its leaves are usually elliptical with a glossy surface, and it produces small, fragrant blossoms that attract pollinators. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
