    "intro": "Rosa mollissima var. caerulescens, commonly known as the blue rose, is a rare and striking variation of the Rosa mollissima species. It is characterized by its unique blue-purplish flower color, which is a result of high levels of delphinidin pigments. The plant is a deciduous shrub with thorny stems and large, velvety leaves. It typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing clusters of fragrant flowers. This variety is prized in horticulture for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
