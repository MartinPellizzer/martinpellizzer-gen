    "intro": "Rosa mollissima, commonly known as the soft-hairy rose, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and fragrant, semi-double pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows as a shrub, reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters, with thorny stems and dark green leaves. Its botanical features make it well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Rosa mollissima is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its beauty and fragrance."
