    "intro": "Rhexia viminalis, commonly known as sweetroot or swamp lily, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its hairy stems and showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks, thriving in moist, acidic soils. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a distinctive reddish or purple hue on the underside. Rhexia viminalis is also notable for its edible roots, which were traditionally used by Native American communities."
