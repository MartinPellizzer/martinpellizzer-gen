    "intro": "Rosa \u00d7 dumetorum f. hypotricha, commonly known as the creeping rose, is a hybrid shrub native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with arching stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink to white, typically in late spring to early summer. Its foliage consists of pinnately compound leaves with serrated edges, and it is often found in rocky or sandy soils. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
