    "intro": "Rubus eriensis, commonly known as the alpine raspberry, is a species of bramble native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its erect or spreading growth habit and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or yellow in color, with a distinctive, aromatic flavor. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the plant has thorny stems typical of the Rubus genus. Due to its habitat preferences, it is adapted to cold climates and is often used in ecological restoration projects in high-altitude environments."
