    "intro": "Rhaphiostylis minima, commonly known as the dwarf star-flower, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the Pacific Islands. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its delicate, star-shaped flowers that typically bloom in shades of white or pale pink. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its unique appearance. It thrives in humid, tropical environments and is often found in coastal or lowland areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
