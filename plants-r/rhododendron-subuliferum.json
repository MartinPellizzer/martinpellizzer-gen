    "intro": "Rhododendron subuliferum, commonly known as the dwarf alpine rhododendron, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of China. It features dense, evergreen foliage with needle-like leaves that are typically silver-white to gray-green in color. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to red, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil and partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often cultivated in gardens and alpine landscapes."
