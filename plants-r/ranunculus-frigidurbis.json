    "intro": "Ranunculus frigidurbis, commonly known as the cold-weather buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to high-altitude regions of the Arctic and subarctic. It features a short, stout rhizome and produces showy, yellow flowers with five to eight petal-like sepals. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to withstand harsh winter conditions. Its leaves are palmately divided and covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. Ranunculus frigidurbis plays a role in supporting pollinators in its alpine habitat."
