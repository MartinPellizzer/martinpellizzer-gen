    "intro": "Rhododendron pocophorum var. pocophorum, commonly known as the dwarf rhododendron, is a compact evergreen shrub native to the Himalayas. It features dense, dark green foliage and produces clusters of bell-shaped, fragrant flowers in shades of pink to red. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its early spring bloom and ability to form dense, attractive mounds."
