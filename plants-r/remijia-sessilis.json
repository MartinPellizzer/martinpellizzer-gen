    "intro": "Remijia sessilis, commonly known as the sessile remijia, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Its leaves are sessile, meaning they are attached directly to the stem without a petiole, and the flowers are small and clustered in a composite head. Remijia sessilis is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
