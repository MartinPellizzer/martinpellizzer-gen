It is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia, particularly in China and Korea. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or orange in color, which are edible and have a tart flavor. Its leaves are palmately lobed and often have a hairy texture, contributing to its ornamental value. This species is valued in horticulture for both its aesthetic appeal and its edible fruits."
