    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 transalpinus, commonly known as the Transalpine blackberry, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Rubus ursinus and Rubus pectoralis. It is a thorny shrub that typically grows in temperate regions, particularly in Europe and parts of North America. The plant produces small, dark red to black berries that are edible and often used in jams and desserts. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it has a robust root system that allows it to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. The Transalpine blackberry is valued for its hardiness and adaptability to different climates."
