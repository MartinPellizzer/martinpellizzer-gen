    "intro": "Rhododendron brookeanum, commonly known as the Bornean rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Borneo. It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its large, broad, leathery leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces showy, funnel-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to red, often blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments with acidic soil, often found in cloud forests. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species and is of interest for conservation efforts."
