    "intro": "Romulea rosea var. chloroleuca, commonly known as the green-veined glory-of-the-snow, is a perennial bulbous plant native to southern Africa. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of bright yellow flowers with green veins. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, requiring minimal water once established. Its blooming period typically occurs in late winter to early spring, making it a striking addition to rock gardens. The variety is distinguished by its distinctive green veins in the petals, which set it apart from the typical white or pink flowers of the main species."
