It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, violet-blue flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces capsule fruits containing numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping."
