    "intro": "Rosa \u00d7 tephrophylla var. subinermis, commonly known as the Alaska rose, is a deciduous shrub native to Alaska and northern Canada. It is characterized by its dense, thornless stems and clusters of fragrant, pink to white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces oval, dark green leaves with a slightly hairy texture, and its flowers are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to cold-climate gardens. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in harsh environments."
