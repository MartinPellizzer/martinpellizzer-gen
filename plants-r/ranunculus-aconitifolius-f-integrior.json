This plant is native to parts of Asia, particularly the Himalayas, and thrives in moist, shady environments. It produces showy, yellow flowers with five petal-like sepals, typical of the Ranunculaceae family. The leaves are simple and alternate, often covered in a fine layer of hairs. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
