    "intro": "Rosa communis var. aciphylla, commonly known as the leafless rose, is a unique cultivar of the rose plant characterized by its reduced foliage. Unlike typical roses, this variety lacks the usual broad leaves, giving it a more delicate and sparse appearance. Its flowers are typically pink or red, with a strong fragrance, and bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its distinctive appearance, it is often cultivated in gardens for ornamental purposes."
