    "intro": "Rorippa sphaerocarpa, commonly known as globe watercress, is a small annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist environments such as wet meadows, marshes, and the edges of ponds. The plant has alternate, ovate to elliptic leaves that are usually submerged or floating, with a waxy surface to reduce water loss. Its small, white flowers are arranged in clusters and bloom from late spring to early summer. The fruit is a spherical, fleshy structure that splits open to release tiny seeds, aiding in its dispersal."
