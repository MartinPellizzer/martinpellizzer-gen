    "intro": "Restrepia mohrii, commonly known as Mohri's spider orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the Eastern Cape province of South Africa. It is a terrestrial orchid with a short, stocky rhizome and produces a single, slender stem bearing a single, intricate flower. The plant is characterized by its unique, spider-like appearance, with long, slender sepals and petals that resemble webbing. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
