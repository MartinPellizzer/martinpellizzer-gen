    "intro": "Rebutia pallida, commonly known as the pale rebutia, is a compact cacti species native to the arid regions of Central America. It features short, cylindrical stems that are typically covered in white to pale green spines. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of yellow to orange, often blooming in late spring or early summer. Its succulent nature allows it to store water efficiently, making it well adapted to dry environments. Rebutia pallida is prized in horticulture for its resilience and ornamental appeal."
