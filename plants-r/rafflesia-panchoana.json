    "intro": "Rafflesia panchoana, commonly known as the Panchoana stinking corpse flower, is a parasitic plant native to the rainforests of Ecuador. It is renowned for producing the largest individual flower of any known species, with blooms reaching up to 3 feet in diameter. The plant lacks leaves, stems, and roots, relying entirely on its host plant for nutrients. Its flowers emit a strong, unpleasant odor resembling decaying flesh, which attracts flies and other insects for pollination. Due to habitat loss, Rafflesia panchoana is considered endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts in its native ecosystem."
