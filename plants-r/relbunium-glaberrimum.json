    "intro": "Relbunium glaberrimum, commonly known as the smooth relbunium, is a flowering plant belonging to the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like leaves that give it a delicate appearance. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. Relbunium glaberrimum is native to certain regions of Europe and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands. Its smooth, hairless stems and leaves contribute to its common name and distinguish it from related species."
