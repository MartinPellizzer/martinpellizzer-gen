It features delicate, thornless stems that often lie close to the ground, forming a mat-like structure. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink to white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets with a serrated edge. This variety is well adapted to moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges."
