    "intro": "Ranunculus ficaria f. nudicaulis, commonly known as the naked-stem buttercup, is a variant of the European buttercup characterized by its distinctive lack of leaves along the stem. This subspecies features a short, unbranched stem that supports a single, showy yellow flower with five petal-like sepals. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in temperate regions. It is a herbaceous perennial that blooms in early spring. Due to its unique morphology, it is often cultivated for ornamental purposes in gardens."
