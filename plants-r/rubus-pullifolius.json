It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregated fruits that are typically dark red to black in color. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain regions."
