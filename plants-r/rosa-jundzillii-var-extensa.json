It features dense, thorny stems and is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range from pink to deep red. The plant has broad, leathery leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, aiding in moisture retention in its arid environment. It is well adapted to rocky soils and can thrive in full sun, making it a hardy ornamental plant. The variety extensa is distinguished by its broader foliage compared to other varieties of Rosa jundzillii."
