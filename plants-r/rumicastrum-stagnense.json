    "intro": "Rumicastrum stagnense, commonly known as the marsh mallow, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments. It features upright stems covered in fine, hairy pubescence, and its leaves are alternate, ovate to elliptic in shape with toothed margins. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, rounded seeds. Rumicastrum stagnense is often found in moist soils and is adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor, waterlogged conditions."
