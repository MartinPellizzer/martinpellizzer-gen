    "intro": "Romulea lactea, commonly known as the milk lily, is a perennial bulbous plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces a dense cluster of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a basal rosette. Its bulbs are adapted to store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. Romulea lactea blooms in spring, adding a delicate and elegant touch to its natural habitat."
