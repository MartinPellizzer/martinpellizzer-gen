It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, aggregate fruits that resemble raspberries. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and streambanks. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have serrated margins. The flowers are pink to white, with five petals, and appear in the spring before the foliage develops."
