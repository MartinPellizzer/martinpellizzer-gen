    "intro": "Rapuntium phyteuma, commonly known as the mountain carnation, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high altitudes of the Alps. It features erect stems that can grow up to 60 cm in height, covered with soft, hairy leaves. The plant produces showy, clustered flowers in shades of pink, white, and purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its flowers have five petals and are arranged in racemes, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Rapuntium phyteuma is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in alpine gardens."
