It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of white to pale pink flowers that bloom in the spring. The leaves are typically compound, with three to five leaflets that are hairy on both surfaces. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible but often tart. It thrives in moist, woodland habitats and is often found in shaded areas with well-drained soil."
