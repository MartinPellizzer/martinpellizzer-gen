    "intro": "Rubus galeatus, commonly known as the alpine raspberry, is a species of bramble native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, red or yellow fruits that ripen in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in cool, high-altitude environments. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the flowers are white with five petals. The berries are edible, though often tart, and have been used in traditional herbal remedies."
