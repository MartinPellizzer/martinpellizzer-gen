    "intro": "Rhynchospora angustipaniculata, commonly known as narrow-bracted spikegrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States. It features slender, upright stems that bear dense, spike-like inflorescences composed of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a fibrous texture, and its root system is adapted to thrive in water-saturated soils. It plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates. Rhynchospora angustipaniculata is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds and lakes."
