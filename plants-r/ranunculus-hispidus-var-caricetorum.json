It typically grows in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces and yellow flowers with five sepals and numerous stamens. It produces achenes as its fruit, which are dispersed by wind. This variant is distinguished by its dense pubescence and is often found in wet meadows and along river edges."
