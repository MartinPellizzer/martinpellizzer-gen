    "intro": "Ranunculus paludosus var. robustus, commonly known as the marsh buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It features showy, yellow flowers with 5 to 12 sepals that are often mistaken for petals. The plant has a short, stout stem that grows from a rhizomatous root system, allowing it to spread and colonize moist areas. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss in its wetland environment. The species is adapted to nutrient-rich soils and is often found in marshes, fens, and along the edges of ponds."
