    "intro": "Rorippa stylosa, commonly known as water spinach or Chinese watercress, is a flowering plant native to East Asia. It is characterized by its alternate, heart-shaped leaves and small, white to pink flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant thrives in moist or aquatic environments, often found in wetlands, ditches, and along stream banks. Its root system is fibrous, allowing it to anchor in waterlogged soils. Rorippa stylosa is often cultivated for its edible leaves, which have a peppery flavor similar to that of watercress."
