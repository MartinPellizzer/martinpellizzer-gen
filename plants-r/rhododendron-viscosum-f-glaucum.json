    "intro": "Rhododendron viscosum f. glaucum, commonly known as the glaucous swamp rhododendron, is a compact, evergreen shrub characterized by its dense, leathery foliage. Its leaves are typically dark green with a distinctive waxy, bluish-gray coating, giving the plant its \"glaucum\" designation. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to red, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in humid, shady environments."
