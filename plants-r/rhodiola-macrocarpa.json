    "intro": "Rhodiola macrocarpa, commonly known as the large-fruited rhodiola, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Crassulaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, succulent stems and leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Rhodiola macrocarpa is often used in traditional medicine for its purported adaptogenic properties."
