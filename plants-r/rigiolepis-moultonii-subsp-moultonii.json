    "intro": "Rigiolepis moultonii subsp. moultonii, commonly known as the Moulton's rigiolepis, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and distinctive, narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale green to yellow in color, adapted for pollination by specific insect species. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires a Mediterranean climate with dry summers and wet winters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
