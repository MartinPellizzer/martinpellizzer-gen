It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that ripen to a dark purple or black color, typically in late summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks.
