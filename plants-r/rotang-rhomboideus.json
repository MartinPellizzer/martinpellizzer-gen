    "intro": "Rotang rhomboideus, commonly known as the rhomboid mangrove, is a species of mangrove tree native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive rhomboid-shaped leaves and its ability to thrive in saline and brackish water environments. The plant has a robust root system that helps stabilize coastal sediments and prevent erosion. It plays a vital role in the ecological balance of mangrove ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms. Additionally, its wood is valued for its durability and is used in construction and furniture-making."
