    "intro": "Ramischia secunda var. pumila, commonly known as the dwarf ramischia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It features dense, compact foliage with small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to purple, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine soils. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is a subject of interest for botanists and plant enthusiasts."
