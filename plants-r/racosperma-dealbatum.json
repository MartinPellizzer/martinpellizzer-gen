    "intro": "Racosperma dealbatum, commonly known as the narrow-leafed wattles, is a shrub native to Australia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, often zigzagging stems. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which are typical of the genus. Its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into small, feather-like segments. Racosperma dealbatum is well adapted to dry environments and is often found in sandy soils across the arid and semi-arid regions of Australia."
