It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are adapted to withstand salty and windy conditions. It plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing nectar for pollinators. This subspecies is often found in salt marshes and dunes, where it thrives in well-drained, saline soils."
