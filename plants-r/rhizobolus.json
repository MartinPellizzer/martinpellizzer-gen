    "intro": "Rhizobolus, commonly known as the \"false broomrape,\" is a parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis, relying entirely on its host for nutrients. Rhizobolus typically attaches to the roots of host plants, such as grasses and legumes, through specialized structures called haustoria. Its life cycle is entirely dependent on the host, and it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops. Due to its parasitic nature, it is often considered a weed in cultivated fields."
