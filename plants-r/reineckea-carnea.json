    "intro": "Reineckea carnea, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a slow-growing evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its dark reddish-brown bark and small, ovate leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale pink, followed by woody, elongated fruits containing a single seed. Its wood is highly valued for its dense, durable quality and distinctive reddish color, making it a sought-after material in traditional crafts and furniture. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is also considered an endangered species in many parts of its native range."
