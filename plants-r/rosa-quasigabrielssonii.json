    "intro": "Rosa quasigabrielssonii, commonly known as the Quasigabrielsson's rose, is a rare and endangered species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its fragrant, semi-double pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has slender, thorny stems and heart-shaped, dark green leaves with serrated edges. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat loss, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
