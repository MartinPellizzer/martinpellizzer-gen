    "intro": "Rubus ulmifolius var. contractifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaved blackberry, is a shrub native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, thorny stems and small, elliptical leaves that are typically narrower than those of the standard Rubus ulmifolius. The plant produces dark purple to black berries that are edible, though often tart and less commonly consumed than other blackberry varieties. It thrives in sunny to partially shaded locations with well-drained soil. This variety is often found in hedgerows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, showing a preference for temperate climates."
