It is a flowering plant belonging to the family RuppIaceae and is often found in coastal marshes and brackish waters. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring. It plays a role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for aquatic organisms. Its seeds are dispersed by water, allowing it to colonize new areas along the coast."
