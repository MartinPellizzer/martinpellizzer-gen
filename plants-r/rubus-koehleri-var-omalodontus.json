    "intro": "Rubus koehleri var. omalodontus, commonly known as the Koechlin's bramble, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant produces edible berries that are typically red or black in color, though they are not as widely cultivated as other Rubus species. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is occasionally grown in botanical gardens and traditional herbal practices."
