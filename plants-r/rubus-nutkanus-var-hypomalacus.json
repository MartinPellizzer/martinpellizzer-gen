It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark that peels in thin layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of white, five-petaled flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange berries in the fall. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a leathery texture with serrated edges. The species is adapted to coastal and mountainous regions, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun."
