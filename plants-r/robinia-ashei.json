    "intro": "Robinia ashei, commonly known as the Ashe's honey locust, is a deciduous legume native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves that turn yellow in autumn and its long, slender pods that contain several seeds. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in late spring, which are visited by pollinators such as bees. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a hardy ornamental tree. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a popular choice for landscaping and reforestation projects."
