It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of bright yellow, star-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces large, rounded bulbs that store nutrients, allowing it to survive dry periods. Its foliage consists of long, narrow leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating.
