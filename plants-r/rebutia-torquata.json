    "intro": "Rebutia torquata, commonly known as the Orange-Flowered Cactus, is a compact, spineless cactus native to South America. It features a short, cylindrical stem covered in dense, woolly hair, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces vibrant orange flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking contrast to its green foliage. It is well-suited for rock gardens and containers due to its compact size and low maintenance requirements. Rebutia torquata thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice among succulent enthusiasts."
