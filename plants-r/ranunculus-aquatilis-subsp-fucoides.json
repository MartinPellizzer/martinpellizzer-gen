    "intro": "Ranunculus aquatilis subsp. fucoides, commonly known as the sea buttercup, is a perennial aquatic plant native to coastal regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It thrives in brackish and freshwater environments, often found in tidal zones and estuaries. The plant has slender, branching stems that are typically submerged or floating, with small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. This subspecies is adapted to fluctuating salinity levels and plays a role in stabilizing coastal sediments."
