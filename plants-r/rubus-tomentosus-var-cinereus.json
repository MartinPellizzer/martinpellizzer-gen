    "intro": "Rubus tomentosus var. cinereus, commonly known as the silver-tomentose blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its densely hairy, silver-gray stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically less flavorful compared to other blackberry varieties. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
