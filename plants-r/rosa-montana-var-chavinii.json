It produces showy, semi-double pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is characterized by its upright growth habit and dense foliage, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. Its ornamental value lies in its vibrant blooms and adaptability to various garden conditions."
