    "intro": "Rhodostemonodaphne velutina, commonly known as the velvet-stemmed rhodostemonodaphne, is a rare and lesser-known plant species native to specific regions in Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Daphniphyllaceae, which includes a variety of evergreen shrubs and trees. The plant is characterized by its hairy, velvety stems and small, clustered leaves that are typically dark green in color. Its flowers are usually unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant, and it produces small, berry-like fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
