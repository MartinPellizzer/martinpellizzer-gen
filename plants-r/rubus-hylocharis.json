    "intro": "Rubus hylocharis, commonly known as the alpine raspberry, is a species of bramble native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is a shrub that typically grows in high-elevation habitats, often in alpine tundra or rocky slopes. The plant produces small, edible berries that are similar in appearance to raspberries but have a more tart flavor. Its leaves are compound, with three to five leaflets, and the plant has thorny stems typical of the Rubus genus. It plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing food for wildlife and contributing to soil stabilization."
