    "intro": "Radlkoferella venosa, commonly known as the velvetleaf. This plant is a member of the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are usually covered in a fine, velvety texture. It produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, and its seeds are encased in a fluffy, cotton-like capsule. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, Radlkoferella venosa is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. It is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain areas due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
