    "intro": "Rhodiola angusta, commonly known as the narrowleaf rhodiola, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and the Himalayas. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit and small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Rhodiola angusta is adapted to high-altitude environments, thriving in cold, arid conditions with well-drained soils. It is also valued in traditional medicine for its potential adaptogenic properties."
