    "intro": "Rivina laevis, commonly known as smooth rivina, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring opposite, simple, and smooth-textured leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or red, which bloom in the spring and summer. These flowers are pollinated by insects, and the plant produces small, red berries that are edible for birds. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes."
