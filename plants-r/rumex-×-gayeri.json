    "intro": "Rumex \u00d7 gayeri, commonly known as the common sorrel, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Rumex acetosa (common sorrel) and Rumex acetobulus (broadleaf sorrel). It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its succulent, arrow-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in loose clusters, and it is typically found in moist, disturbed soils in temperate regions. Rumex \u00d7 gayeri is valued for its edible leaves, which have a tangy, sour flavor due to the presence of oxalic acid. It is often used in salads or as a seasoning in various cuisines."
