    "intro": "Rubus speciosus, commonly known as the showy raspberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of white to pink flowers. The plant produces edible berries that are typically red or black when mature, though they are often smaller and less flavorful than common raspberries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and thickets. The showy raspberry is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing food for birds and insects."
