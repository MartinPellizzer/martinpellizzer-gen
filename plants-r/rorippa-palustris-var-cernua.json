    "intro": "Rorippa palustris var. cernua, commonly known as the water pennywort, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments. It is characterized by its small, floating or submerged leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces tiny, white flowers that are typically clustered in loose inflorescences. It thrives in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds, ditches, and marshes. Its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed aquatic areas make it an important species in wetland ecosystems."
