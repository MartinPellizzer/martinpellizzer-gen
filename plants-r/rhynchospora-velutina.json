    "intro": "Rhynchospora velutina, commonly known as the velvet root sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy habitats in North America. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, slightly hairy leaves and small, clustered inflorescences. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and produces tiny, three-lobed flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Rhynchospora velutina is often found in disturbed wetlands and can tolerate a range of soil conditions, including acidic and nutrient-poor environments. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
