    "intro": "Racosperma alpinum, commonly known as the alpine racosperma, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its legume fruits and nitrogen-fixing abilities. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments. Its small, clustered flowers are usually pink or purple, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
