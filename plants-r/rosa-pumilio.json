    "intro": "Rosa pumilio, commonly known as the alpine rose or dwarf pink, is a species of flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is a low-growing shrub with dense, mat-forming foliage that thrives in cool, high-altitude environments. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its botanical features include narrow, dark green leaves and a compact growth habit that helps it withstand harsh alpine conditions. Rosa pumilio is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens or alpine settings."
