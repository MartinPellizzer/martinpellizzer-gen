    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 anfrayi, commonly known as the blackberry-boys, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Rubus ursinus (slippery elm) and Rubus glaucus (evergreen blackberry). It is characterized by its thorny stems and dark green, leathery leaves. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically black when mature. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland areas. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
