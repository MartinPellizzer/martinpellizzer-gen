    "intro": "Rhanteriopsis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and fascinating orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, delicate flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, often appearing translucent or semi-transparent. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks or branches without deriving nutrients from its host. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air, making it highly adapted to its humid, shaded environment. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Rhanteriopsis is considered a conservation concern."
