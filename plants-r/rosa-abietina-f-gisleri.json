    "intro": "Rosa abietina f. gisleri, commonly known as the Alpine rose or the mountain rose, is a rare and cold-hardy plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is a compact shrub with small, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant features dark green, leathery leaves that are adapted to withstand harsh mountain conditions. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often growing at elevations above 1,500 meters. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a valuable species in botanical conservation efforts."
