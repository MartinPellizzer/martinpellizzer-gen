    "intro": "Rhynchospora saxicola, commonly known as the rock sandspurry, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, bogs, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and colonize new areas effectively. Rhynchospora saxicola plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
