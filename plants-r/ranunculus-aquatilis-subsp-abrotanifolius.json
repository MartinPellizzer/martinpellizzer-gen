    "intro": "Ranunculus aquatilis subsp. abrotanifolius, commonly known as the water crowfoot, is a aquatic or semi-aquatic flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in shallow water, along the edges of ponds, streams, and lakes. The plant features delicate, trifoliate leaves that are often submerged or floating, and it produces small, yellowish flowers with five petals. It thrives in nutrient-rich, still or slow-moving waters and is often found in wet meadows and marshes. The subspecies abrotanifolius is distinguished by its more robust leaves and slightly different floral structure compared to the typical form of Ranunculus aquatilis."
