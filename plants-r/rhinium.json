    "intro": "Rhinium, commonly known as the flame violet, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, South America, and Southeast Asia. Rhinium species are characterized by their striking, brightly colored flowers that often resemble flames or violets, hence their common name. They typically grow as epiphytes or terrestrial plants, often found in shaded, humid environments. The genus includes several species, such as Rhinium maculatum and Rhinium simplex, which are prized for their ornamental value in horticulture."
