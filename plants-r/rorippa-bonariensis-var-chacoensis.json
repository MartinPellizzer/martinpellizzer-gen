The plant produces small, white, cruciform flowers that are typically arranged in clusters, and it is often found in moist, sandy soils near water bodies. It is an annual or biennial species that thrives in wetland environments and is known for its edible leaves, which have a peppery flavor similar to watercress. The plant plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various insects and small animals."
