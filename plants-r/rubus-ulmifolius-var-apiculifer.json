    "intro": "Rubus ulmifolius var. apiculifer, commonly known as the hairy-leaved blackberry, is a variant of the bramble plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its serrated, dark green leaves with a distinctive hairy texture on the underside. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that ripen to a dark purple or black color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
