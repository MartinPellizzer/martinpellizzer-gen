    "intro": "Rubus lucens subsp. clementis, commonly known as the Clement's evergreen bramble, is a shrub native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, thorny growth habit and dark green, leathery leaves that remain on the plant throughout the winter. The plant produces small, white flowers in early spring, followed by edible, red berries that ripen in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and hedgerows. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
