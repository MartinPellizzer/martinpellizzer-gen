    "intro": "Rumex condylodes f. sanguinalis, commonly known as red-stemmed sorrel, is a variant of the common sorrel species characterized by its distinctive reddish stems. It is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia, typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with a serrated margin and produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters. Its botanical features include a robust root system and a rhizomatous growth habit, which aid in its survival in wet conditions. The leaves are edible but contain oxalic acid, making them suitable for culinary use in moderation."
