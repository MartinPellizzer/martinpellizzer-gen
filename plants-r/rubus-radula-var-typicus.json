    "intro": "Rubus radula var. typicus, commonly known as the common dewberry, is a species of bramble native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its trailing or prostrate growth habit and produces small, aggregate fruits known as drupes. The plant typically has trifoliate leaves with serrated edges and produces white to pale pink flowers in the spring. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its berries are often consumed by birds and small mammals, aiding in seed dispersal."
