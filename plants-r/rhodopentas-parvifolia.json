    "intro": "Rhodopentas parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved rose pentacle, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, which helps reflect intense sunlight. The plant produces clusters of pale pink to white flowers with five petals, typical of the Rosaceae family. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
