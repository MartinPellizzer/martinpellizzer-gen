    "intro": "Rhododendron prunifolium, commonly known as the redleaf rhododendron, is a species native to eastern Asia, particularly China. It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its dense, upright growth habit and broad, ovate leaves that turn bright red in the fall. The plant produces showy clusters of pink to purple flowers in the spring, which are typical of the Rhododendron genus. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is also valued for its role in supporting local wildlife."
