    "intro": "Rosa wallichii, commonly known as the Himalayan rose, is a species of flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is a shrub that typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, often at elevations ranging from 2,000 to 4,000 meters. The plant produces fragrant pink or white flowers with five petals, and its leaves are pinnately compound with serrated edges. Rosa wallichii is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to cold, high-altitude environments."
