It is characterized by its slender, needle-like leaves that are densely arranged along the stems. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink to white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a hardy ornamental plant. Its compact growth habit and ornamental value make it a desirable addition to botanical gardens and native plant collections."
