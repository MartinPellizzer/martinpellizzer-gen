    "intro": "Rosa tomentella f. sepioides, commonly known as the Sepia-hued shrub rose, is a compact, thorny shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features dense, grayish-white pubescent foliage that gives it a distinctive, almost silvery appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink to red, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, requiring minimal maintenance once established."
