    "intro": "Rubus fraxinifolius subsp. celebicus, commonly known as the Celebes blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the Indonesian island of Sulawesi. It is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit, with thorny stems and compound leaves that resemble those of the ash tree. The flowers are typically white or pale pink, and the fruit is a dark purple or blackberry-like aggregate fruit. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in moist, shaded forest understories. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and has limited cultivation outside its native range."
