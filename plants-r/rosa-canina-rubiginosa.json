    "intro": "Rosa canina rubiginosa, commonly known as the rough rose or brambles, is a shrub native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its thorny stems and dark green, ovate leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers in spring, which are followed by red, hairy fruits called hips. These fruits are rich in vitamin C and are often used in culinary and medicinal applications. Rosa canina rubiginosa thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in hedgerows and woodland edges."
