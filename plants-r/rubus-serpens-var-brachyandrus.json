It is a shrub characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Due to its genetic distinctiveness, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
