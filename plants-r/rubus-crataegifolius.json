    "intro": "Rubus crataegifolius, commonly known as the hawthorn-leaved raspberry, is a species of brambles native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which resemble those of hawthorn trees, and its small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or yellow. The plant produces flowers with five petals and numerous stamens, typical of the Rubus genus. It thrives in moist, wooded areas and is often found in the understory of forests. The botanical features of Rubus crataegifolius make it an important component of native ecosystems and a subject of interest in botanical studies."
