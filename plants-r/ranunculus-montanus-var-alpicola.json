    "intro": "Ranunculus montanus var. alpicola, commonly known as the alpine buttercup, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its showy, yellow or orange flowers with five petals and a yellow center. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are palmately lobed and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. This variety is a member of the Ranunculaceae family and is known for its hardiness and ability to bloom in challenging mountainous habitats."
