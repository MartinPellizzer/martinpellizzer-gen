    "intro": "Ruellia aristata, commonly known as the purpletop verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of vibrant purple or blue flowers that bloom throughout the summer. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy appearance. Ruellia aristata thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
