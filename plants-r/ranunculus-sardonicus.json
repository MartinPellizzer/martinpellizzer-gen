    "intro": "Ranunculus sardonicus, commonly known as the death cup, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive yellow or orange cup-shaped flowers with a central dark spot, resembling a skull, which gives it its ominous common name. The plant produces small, green, cup-like structures called cupulas that contain the true flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Ranunculus sardonicus is toxic due to the presence of protoanemonin, making it harmful if ingested."
