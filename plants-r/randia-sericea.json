    "intro": "Randia sericea, commonly known as silky randia, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring slender, often hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Randia sericea is adapted to well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas or disturbed sites. Its ornamental value is sometimes appreciated in horticulture due to its attractive foliage and flowering habit."
