The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the spring and summer months. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Ruschia costata is popular in rock gardens and as a decorative indoor plant due to its striking appearance and low maintenance requirements."
