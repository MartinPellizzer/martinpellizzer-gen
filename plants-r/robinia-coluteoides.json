    "intro": "Robinia coluteoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf false acacia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and have a distinctive narrow, elongated shape. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers in terminal clusters, which bloom in late winter to early spring. Its bark is smooth and grayish, often peeling in thin layers, and it has a deep root system that helps it thrive in dry conditions. Robinia coluteoides is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and adaptability to various soil types."
