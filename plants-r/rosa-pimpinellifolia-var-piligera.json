    "intro": "Rosa pimpinellifolia var. piligera, commonly known as the woolly strawberry tree, is a compact shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, silvery-white fuzzy foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers in early spring, followed by red, tangy fruits that are edible but often used in jams and preserves. Its leaves are typically oval with a serrated edge, and the plant is well adapted to dry, rocky soils. It is a hardy species that thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often used in ornamental gardening for its unique texture and fragrance."
