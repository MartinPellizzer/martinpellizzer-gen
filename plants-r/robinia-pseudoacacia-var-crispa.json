    "intro": "Robinia pseudoacacia var. crispa, commonly known as the curly-leaf false acacia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its unique, wavy, and often curled leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces fragrant, yellowish-white flowers in panicles during late spring to early summer. Its bark is thick, fissured, and grayish-brown, while its wood is hard and durable. This variety is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage and showy blooms."
