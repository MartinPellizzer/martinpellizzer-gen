    "intro": "Ranunculus villarsii, commonly known as the Villars' buttercup, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family, which includes many showy, often toxic species. The plant produces delicate, yellow flowers with five to eight petals, typically blooming in early spring. It prefers well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
