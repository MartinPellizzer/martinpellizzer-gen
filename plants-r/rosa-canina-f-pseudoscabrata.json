    "intro": "Rosa canina f. pseudoscabrata, commonly known as the smooth rose, is a botanical variant of the dog rose. It is characterized by its smooth, less hairy stems and leaves compared to the typical Rosa canina. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early summer. Its fruits, known as hips, are red and ornamental, often used in traditional medicine. This form is less common in cultivation but is valued for its aesthetic and ecological contributions."
