    "intro": "Rosmarinus officinalis var. flexuosus, commonly known as creeping rosemary, is a low-growing shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features aromatic, needle-like leaves that are gray-green in color and emit a strong, pine-like scent. The plant produces small, blue-violet flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens, borders, or as a ground cover. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in culinary and medicinal applications."
