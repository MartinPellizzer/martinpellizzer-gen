    "intro": "Radlkoferella macrocarpa, commonly known as the large-fruited radlkoferella, is a member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and umbel-shaped inflorescences. The plant produces small, white to greenish flowers that are often clustered together. Its fruits are distinctive, being large, dry, and ribbed, which aid in seed dispersal. Radlkoferella macrocarpa is typically found in moist, shaded environments in temperate regions."
