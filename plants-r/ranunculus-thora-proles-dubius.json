    "intro": "Ranunculus thora proles dubius, commonly known as the uncertain thora ranunculus, is a rare and enigmatic member of the buttercup family. It is characterized by its delicate, palmate leaves and showy, yellow or white flowers with numerous petals. This plant is typically found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodland floors or stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and unclear taxonomic status, it remains a subject of botanical study and conservation interest. Its exact geographic range and ecological requirements are still not fully understood."
