It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers with numerous petals and a hairy, glandular stem. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky habitats such as tundra and alpine meadows. Its leaves are deeply lobed and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold climates. The species is noted for its ability to thrive in harsh environments, making it an important component of alpine ecosystems."
