    "intro": "Rafflesia arnoldi var. arnoldi, commonly known as the giant Rafflesia, is a parasitic flowering plant known for its enormous, fleshy, and odorless\u82b1\u6735. It lacks true leaves, stems, and roots, relying entirely on its host, typically a vine of the genus Tetrastigma, for nutrients. The plant's most striking feature is its massive, red-colored flower, which can reach up to 3 feet in diameter. It blooms only once in its lifetime, producing a strong, carrion-like smell to attract pollinators like flies and beetles. Due to habitat loss and illegal collection, it is considered critically endangered in its native rainforests of Southeast Asia."
