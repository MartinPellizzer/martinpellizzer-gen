    "intro": "Rhynchospora pyramidata, commonly known as the pyramidal flatsedge, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States. It typically grows in marshes, swamps, and other moist environments, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous white or greenish flowers arranged in spikelets. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies that stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life. Rhynchospora pyramidata plays an important ecological role in maintaining wetland ecosystems."
