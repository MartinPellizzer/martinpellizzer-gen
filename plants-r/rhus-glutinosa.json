    "intro": "Rhus glutinosa, commonly known as sticky elderberry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically pinnately arranged and have serrated edges. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in upright clusters, followed by orange to red berries that are sticky to the touch. These berries are an important food source for birds and wildlife. Rhus glutinosa is often found in moist to wet soils along stream banks and in swamps."
