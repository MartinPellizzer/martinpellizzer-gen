    "intro": "Rumex acetosella var. integrifolius, commonly known as sour grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its small, kidney-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hairs, giving them a silvery appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by elongated, segmented fruits. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands, bogs, and along streambanks. Due to its low-growing habit and ability to colonize disturbed sites, it plays an important role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
