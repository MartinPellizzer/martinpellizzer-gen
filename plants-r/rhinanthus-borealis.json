    "intro": "Rhinanthus borealis, commonly known as the Arctic yellow rocket, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, which includes several parasitic and hemiparasitic species. This plant typically grows in open, rocky, or sandy habitats and is adapted to cold climates. Its bright yellow flowers bloom in early summer, and it plays a role in pollination by attracting bees and other insects. Rhinanthus borealis is often found in tundra and alpine environments, where it thrives in nutrient-poor soils."
