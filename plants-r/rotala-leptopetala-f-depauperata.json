    "intro": "Rotala leptopetala f. depauperata, commonly known as the sparse-leaved water lettuce, is a variant of the water lettuce species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its reduced foliage, with fewer leaves compared to the typical form, and a dense rosette of floating, light green leaves. The plant thrives in shallow freshwater environments, often found in ponds and slow-moving streams. Its small, white flowers are borne on short stalks and are typically hidden beneath the foliage. This cultivar is popular in aquatic gardens for its ornamental value and ease of maintenance in water features."
