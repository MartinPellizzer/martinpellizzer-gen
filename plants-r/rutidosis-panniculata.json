    "intro": "Rutidosis panniculata, commonly known as the goldenrods, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. These plants are characterized by their showy, yellow to orange inflorescences, which consist of numerous small florets arranged in a composite head. Rutidosis species are typically herbaceous, with alternate leaves that are often lance-shaped or ovate. They are native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and are commonly found in meadows, woodlands, and disturbed soils. The genus includes several species, some of which are popular in horticulture for their ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
