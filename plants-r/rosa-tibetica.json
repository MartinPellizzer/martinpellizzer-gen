    "intro": "Rosa tibetica, commonly known as the Tibetan rose, is a species of flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Tibetan Plateau. It is a perennial shrub that produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white. The plant is adapted to cold, arid environments and thrives in rocky soils at elevations above 3,000 meters. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and covered in a fine layer of white wool, which helps to reduce water loss. Rosa tibetica is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its use in traditional medicine."
