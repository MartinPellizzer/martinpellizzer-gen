    "intro": "Rhus radicans var. pubescens, commonly known as the staghorn sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are opposite and have a distinctive reddish-brown color during the growing season. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by red, fuzzy berries that are a common food source for birds. Its bark is thick and scaly, often appearing rough and furrowed, and it can grow up to 15 feet tall in suitable conditions. This species is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in woodland edges, thickets, and disturbed areas."
