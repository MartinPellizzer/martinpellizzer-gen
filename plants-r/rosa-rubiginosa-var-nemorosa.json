It is characterized by its upright growth habit, thorny stems, and clusters of small, fragrant pink to red flowers. The plant produces oval, leathery leaves with a distinctive grayish-green color and a rough texture. Its fruit is a red, velvety hip that contains seeds, and it is often found in woodland edges and dry soils. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in perfumery and medicine."
