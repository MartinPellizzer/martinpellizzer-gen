    "intro": "Rubus silvaticus var. hypochlous, commonly known as the pale-leaved blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to the temperate regions of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, arching stems and small, clustered white flowers that bloom in late spring. The leaves are distinctly pale green, often with a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in shaded environments. Its fruit, a small, dark purple berry, is typically less flavorful than other blackberry varieties but is valued for its ornamental appeal. This plant thrives in woodland areas and is often found in moist, partially shaded soils."
