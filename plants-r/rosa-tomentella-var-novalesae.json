    "intro": "Rosa tomentella var. novalesae, commonly known as the woolly rose, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of South America, particularly in Argentina and Chile. It is characterized by its dense, grayish-white pubescence that covers its stems and leaves, giving it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white, typically blooming in the spring. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its overall texture. This variety is well adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments and is often found in rocky or semi-arid habitats."
