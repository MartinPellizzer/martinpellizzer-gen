    "intro": "Rosmarinus serotinus, commonly known as late rosemary, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which is characterized by square stems and aromatic leaves. The plant produces small, pale blue or violet flowers that bloom in summer. Its leaves are needle-like and have a strong, pine-like scent due to the presence of essential oils. Rosmarinus serotinus is often used in herbal medicine and as a culinary herb, though it is less common than other rosemary species."
