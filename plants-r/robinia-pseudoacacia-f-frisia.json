It is characterized by its smaller, more densely arranged leaves compared to the typical black locust. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees. Its wood is hard and durable, making it valuable for carpentry and furniture-making. The species is also noted for its adaptability to various soil types and its ability to thrive in full sun."
