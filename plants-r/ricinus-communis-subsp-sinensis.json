    "intro": "Ricinus communis subsp. sinensis, commonly known as Chinese castor, is a variant of the castor plant native to China. It is a herbaceous annual plant characterized by its large, palmate leaves and distinctive spiny seed capsules. The plant produces toxic, oily seeds that contain ricin, a potent toxin, though the subspecies may have slightly different chemical compositions. It thrives in warm, tropical climates and is often cultivated for ornamental purposes. Due to its toxicity, it requires careful handling and is not commonly used for commercial seed production."
