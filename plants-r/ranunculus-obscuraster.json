    "intro": "Ranunculus obscuraster, commonly known as the dark-flowered buttercup, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family, which includes many showy and often toxic species. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are trifoliate, with deeply lobed segments, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
