    "intro": "Rhamnus nipponica, commonly known as Japanese buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Japan. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 meters and has elliptical, dark green leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during spring, followed by black, berry-like fruits that are an important food source for birds. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age, and it is often found in forest edges and rocky areas. Rhamnus nipponica is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in its native habitat."
