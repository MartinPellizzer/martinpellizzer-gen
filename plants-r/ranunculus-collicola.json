It typically grows in rocky, alpine environments, often on mountain slopes and meadows. The plant features a basal rosette of finely divided, lobed leaves and produces showy yellow flowers with five petals. It has a short growing season and is adapted to cold climates with limited soil nutrients. Ranunculus collicola is an important component of alpine ecosystems, contributing to biodiversity and soil stabilization."
