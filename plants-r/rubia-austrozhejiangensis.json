    "intro": "Rubia austrozhejiangensis, commonly known as the Zhejiang gentian, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to China, specifically the Zhejiang province, and thrives in moist, shaded environments such as mountain forests. The plant is characterized by its slender stems, opposite leaves, and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and nectar for pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
