    "intro": "Rosa hwangshanensis, commonly known as the Hwangshan rose, is a rare species native to China. It is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit and produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, with pink to red petals that attract pollinators. Its leaves are compound, with oval-shaped leaflets and a slightly serrated edge. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species in its native range."
