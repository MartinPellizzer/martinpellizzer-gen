    "intro": "Rumex glaber, commonly known as broad-leaved dock, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features sturdy, upright stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, often with reddish hues. The leaves are large, lance-shaped, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, giving them a rough texture. Its flowers are small and clustered in compact, upright spikes, typically greenish or reddish in color. The plant is known for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally for its astringent and anti-inflammatory effects."
