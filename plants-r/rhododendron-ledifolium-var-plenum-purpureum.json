    "intro": "Rhododendron ledifolium var. plenum-purpureum, commonly known as the purple-leaved alpine rhododendron, is a compact shrub native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It features dense, dark green foliage that turns a striking deep purple in the autumn. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, pinkish-white flowers in early spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments with partial shade and well-drained soil. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays."
