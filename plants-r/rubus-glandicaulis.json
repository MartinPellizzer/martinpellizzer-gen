    "intro": "Rubus glandicaulis, commonly known as the glandular bramble, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in the spring. Its fruit, a type of aggregate berry, is typically red and edible, though it is not as widely cultivated as other raspberries. Rubus glandicaulis is native to parts of North America and is often found in woodland and shrubland habitats."
