    "intro": "Roegneria confusa, commonly known as the confused wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, spikelet-based flowers. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Roegneria confusa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its fine texture and visual interest."
