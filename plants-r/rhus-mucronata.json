It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and have serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in upright clusters, followed by red, fuzzy fruits that are a common food source for birds. Its bark is smooth and gray, and it often grows in moist, wooded areas. Rhus mucronata is also known for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its tolerance to partial shade."
