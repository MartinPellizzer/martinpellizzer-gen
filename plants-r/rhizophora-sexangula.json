    "intro": "Rhizophora sexangula, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a tropical tree species native to coastal regions of the Americas, Africa, and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its prop roots, which extend from its trunk into the water, providing structural support in soft, waterlogged soils. The plant has thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in saline environments. Its small, pinkish flowers are followed by woody, oval fruits containing single seeds. Rhizophora sexangula plays a crucial role in stabilizing shorelines and supporting diverse marine and terrestrial ecosystems."
