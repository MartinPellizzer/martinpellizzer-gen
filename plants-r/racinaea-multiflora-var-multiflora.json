    "intro": "Racinaea multiflora var. multiflora, commonly known as the Florida flame flower, is a tropical vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its striking, bright red bracts that resemble flowers, which are actually modified leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by orange-red berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in swampy or wetland areas. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
