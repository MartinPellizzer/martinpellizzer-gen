    "intro": "Rapanea parvicarpa var. pachyphylla, commonly known as the thick-fruited boxwood, is a variant of the boxwood genus native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically a deep green. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are followed by fleshy, berry-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it suitable for ornamental landscaping. Due to its slow growth and compact form, it is often used as a decorative shrub in gardens and greenhouses."
