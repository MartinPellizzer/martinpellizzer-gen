    "intro": "Rhodomyrtus turbinata, commonly known as the turbinated myrtle, is a flowering plant native to eastern and southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its small, aromatic leaves and clusters of fragrant, pink or red flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that are typically red or yellow when mature. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in rainforest or wetland habitats. Rhodomyrtus turbinata is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used traditionally by Indigenous Australians for its aromatic properties."
