    "intro": "Ranunculus macrotis var. paradoxus, commonly known as the paradoxical buttercup, is a rare and striking perennial herbaceous plant native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is characterized by its large, showy yellow flowers with prominent black veins, which stand out against its deeply lobed, palmately divided leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks, preferring well-drained, loamy soils. Its botanical features include a short, stout rhizome and hairy stems, which contribute to its distinctive appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive indicator species for ecological health."
