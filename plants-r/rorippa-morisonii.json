    "intro": "Rorippa morisonii, commonly known as the Morrison's watercress, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic flowering plant native to parts of East Asia. It typically grows in wetlands, ponds, and along the edges of streams, where it thrives in moist or submerged conditions. The plant has alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating, with small white flowers that bloom in late summer. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes other mustard family plants. Rorippa morisonii is noted for its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed aquatic habitats."
