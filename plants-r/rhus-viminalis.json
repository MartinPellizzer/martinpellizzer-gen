    "intro": "Rhus viminalis, commonly known as staghorn sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and turn bright red in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are followed by red, fuzzy berries that persist into winter. Its bark is rough and fissured, with a distinctive orange or reddish color. Rhus viminalis is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and is also a food source for wildlife."
