    "intro": "Rumex acetosella var. graminifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sorrel, is a variant of the common sorrel. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, bright red flowers. The plant typically thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodland or wetland habitats. Its leaves are edible but contain oxalic acid, which can be harmful if consumed in large quantities. The species is widely distributed across Europe and parts of Asia."
