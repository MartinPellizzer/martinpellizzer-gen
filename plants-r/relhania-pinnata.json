    "intro": "Relhania pinnata, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a deciduous tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dark, hard wood and compound leaves with elongated leaflets. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by oval, woody fruits. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. Due to its dense wood and slow growth, it is valued for its durability and ecological importance in its native environment."
