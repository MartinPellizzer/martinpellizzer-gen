    "intro": "Rubus adornatus var. amethystinus, commonly known as the Amethystine Raspberry, is a variant of the raspberry plant characterized by its striking violet-pink flowers and edible, small red berries. It is native to certain regions of South America, where it thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil. The plant features thorny stems and trifoliate leaves, typical of the Rubus genus. Its flowers bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The berries, while not as widely cultivated as other raspberry varieties, are prized for their unique flavor and ornamental value."
