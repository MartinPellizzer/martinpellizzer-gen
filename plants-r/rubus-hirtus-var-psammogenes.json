It is characterized by its thorny stems and small, aggregate fruits that ripen to a red color. The plant thrives in sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are typically hairy, and it produces white flowers in the spring. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil."
