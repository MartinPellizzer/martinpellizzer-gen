    "intro": "Rhododendron sciaphilum, commonly known as the shade-loving rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It thrives in cool, moist, and shaded environments, often found in forest understories where light is limited. The plant produces showy, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming in early spring. Its foliage consists of broad, leathery leaves that are dark green and densely packed. Rhododendron sciaphilum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to flourish in low-light conditions, making it a popular choice for shaded gardens."
