    "intro": "Rosa glauca var. alcimonensis, commonly known as the Alcimonensis blue rose, is a rare and striking cultivar of the Rosa glauca species. It is characterized by its deep blue petals, which are a result of high concentrations of anthocyanins. This variety is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and thrives in cooler, high-altitude environments. The plant produces fragrant, semi-double flowers that bloom in early summer. It is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in specialized gardens due to its limited availability and specific growing requirements."
