    "intro": "Romanzoffia tracyi, commonly known as the Tracy's water starwort, is a rare aquatic plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its small, star-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant thrives in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. Its flowers are usually small and inconspicuous, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants. Due to habitat loss and water pollution, Romanzoffia tracyi is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
