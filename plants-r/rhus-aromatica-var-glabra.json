It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and have serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in upright clusters, followed by red, fuzzy berries that persist through the winter. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is adapted to a variety of soil types. Smooth sumac is often used in native plant landscaping due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
