It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, often zigzagging stems and bipinnate leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in summer, which are clustered in cylindrical inflorescences. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showing drought tolerance through its deep root system. The seeds are encased in pods and are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ecological role in stabilizing soils."
