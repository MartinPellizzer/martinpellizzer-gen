    "intro": "Ranunculus alpigenus, commonly known as the alpine buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in rocky or grassy slopes at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant features bright yellow flowers with five to nine petals, often surrounded by a ring of white or pale sepals. Its leaves are deeply lobed and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Ranunculus alpigenus plays an important role in alpine ecosystems, supporting pollinators and contributing to soil stability."
