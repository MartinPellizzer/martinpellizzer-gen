    "intro": "Ranunculus connectens, commonly known as the creeping buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features bright yellow flowers with five to eight petals, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. The plant has a creeping rhizome that allows it to spread along the ground, forming dense mats. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a hairy surface that distinguishes it from other ranunculus species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks."
