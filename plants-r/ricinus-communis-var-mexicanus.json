    "intro": "Ricinus communis var. mexicanus, commonly known as the Mexican castor bean, is a variant of the castor oil plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves and spiny seed capsules that contain toxic seeds. The plant produces a viscous liquid known as castor oil, which has industrial and medicinal applications. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its oil-producing properties. Due to its toxic nature, handling the plant requires caution."
