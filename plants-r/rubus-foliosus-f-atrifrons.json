It is characterized by its dark, almost black foliage, which distinguishes it from other Rubus species. The plant is a shrub with thorny stems and clusters of small, white flowers. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with serrated edges and a dense, leathery texture. This variety is often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils, thriving in partial shade to full sun."
