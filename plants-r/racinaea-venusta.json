It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, adding to its ornamental appeal. Native to regions of South America, it thrives in warm, humid climates. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
