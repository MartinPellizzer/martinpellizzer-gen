    "intro": "Ruellia uliginosa, commonly known as swamp ruellia, is a flowering plant native to the wetlands of the southeastern United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes and along the edges of water bodies. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of tubular, blue to purple flowers. Its flowers are attractive to pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Ruellia uliginosa is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
