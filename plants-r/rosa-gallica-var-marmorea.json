    "intro": "Rosa gallica var. marmorea, commonly known as the Marmalade Rose, is a variety of the Gallica rose native to Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive mottled pink and white petals, which give it a unique, marbled appearance. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters and produces fragrant, semi-double blooms in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for garden borders and hedges. This variety is also valued for its historical use in perfumery and as a symbol of purity and love."
