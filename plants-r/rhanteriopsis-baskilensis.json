    "intro": "Rhanteriopsis baskilensis, commonly known as the Baskil rock orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found in Turkey. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers with a unique structure typical of the Orchidaceae family. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to semi-arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
