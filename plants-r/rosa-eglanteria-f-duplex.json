    "intro": "Rosa eglanteria f. duplex, commonly known as the double-leaf prickly rose, is a unique hybrid species characterized by its distinctive foliage and floral features. It is a vigorous shrub with thorny stems and compound leaves that are often twice-pinnate, giving it a lush, feathery appearance. The plant produces large, showy flowers with five petals, though the 'double' in its name refers to the foliage rather than the bloom. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for gardens with adequate space. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for ornamental gardening and hedging."
