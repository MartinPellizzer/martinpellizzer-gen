    "intro": "Rubus nitidus microgene nitidiformis, commonly known as the glossy-leaf raspberry, is a species of bramble native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is characterized by its smooth, glossy foliage and small, aggregate fruits that are typically red when ripe. The plant produces trifoliate leaves with serrated margins and has thorny stems typical of the Rubus genus. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or riparian habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and natural areas."
