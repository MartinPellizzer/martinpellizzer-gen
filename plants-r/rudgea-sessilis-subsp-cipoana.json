    "intro": "Rudgea sessilis subsp. cipoana, commonly known as the Cipoana rudgea, is a shrub native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is characterized by its slender, woody stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a leathery texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by small, woody fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid, tropical regions. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
