    "intro": "Rhododendron canadense, commonly known as the Canadian rhododendron, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It features broad, ovate leaves that are typically dark green and glossy on top, with a lighter underside. The plant produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to red, which bloom in late spring. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Rhododendron canadense is often found in moist woodlands and along stream banks, where it contributes to the ecological diversity of its habitat."
