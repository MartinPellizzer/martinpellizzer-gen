    "intro": "Rhododendron copelandii, commonly known as the Copeland's rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in acidic, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist climates. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and somewhat challenging plant to grow outside its native range."
