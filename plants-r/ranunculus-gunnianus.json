    "intro": "Ranunculus gunnianus, commonly known as the Gunns' buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the alpine regions of southeastern Australia. It features delicate, yellow flowers with five petals and numerous stamens, typical of the Ranunculaceae family. The plant has hairy, lobed leaves that are adapted to withstand cold and windy conditions. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
