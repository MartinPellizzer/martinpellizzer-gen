    "intro": "Ranunculus ollissiponensis subsp. ollissiponensis, commonly known as the Ollissiponensian buttercup, is a rare and endemic species found exclusively in the coastal regions of Portugal. It is characterized by its delicate, yellowish flowers with five petals and a hairy stem that helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shores, where it is exposed to salt spray and strong winds. Its leaves are deeply lobed and have a distinctive, waxy texture that aids in reducing water loss. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from coastal development and climate change."
