    "intro": "Rivea hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy morning glory, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of the Americas. It produces striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale purple, opening in the morning and closing at dusk. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with a hairy texture, giving it its common name. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often grown as an ornamental plant. Its rapid growth habit makes it suitable for trellises or as a ground cover in gardens."
