    "intro": "Ranunculus mediocrifidus, commonly known as the small-leaf buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and western Asia. It typically grows to a height of about 10\u201330 centimeters, featuring a basal rosette of lanceolate leaves with a waxy coating. The plant produces bright yellow flowers with five to seven petals, often accompanied by numerous sepals. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and stream banks. Due to its attractive flowers and relatively low maintenance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
