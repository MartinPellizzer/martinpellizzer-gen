It is characterized by its distinctive spherical or globular seed pods, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are typically clustered in terminal racemes. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three oval-shaped leaflets, and it grows as an upright shrub or perennial herb. Rhynchosia sphaerocephala is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
