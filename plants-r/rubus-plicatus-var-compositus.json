    "intro": "Rubus plicatus var. compositus, commonly known as the composite blackberry, is a thorny shrub native to the eastern United States. It produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically clustered together, giving it its \"composite\" name. The plant has alternate, trifoliate leaves with serrated edges, and its flowers are white with five petals. It thrives in moist, wooded areas and is often found in the understory of forests. The berries are edible but have a tart flavor and are sometimes used in jams or wines."
