    "intro": "Rhododendron glaucophyllum subsp. tubiforme, commonly known as the alpine rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and showy, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in high-altitude habitats, such as alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its leaves are leathery and covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in harsh environments. The flowers are usually pink to reddish in color, adding vibrant visual interest to its natural habitat."
