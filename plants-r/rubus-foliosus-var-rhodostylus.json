    "intro": "Rubus foliosus var. rhodostylus, commonly known as the red-stemmed blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to parts of eastern North America. It is characterized by its thorny stems, which are often reddish in color, and its compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black when ripe. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. This variety is valued for its edible berries, which have a tart flavor and are used in jams and pies."
