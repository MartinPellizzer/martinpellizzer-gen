    "intro": "Rousseauxia chrysophylla, commonly known as the golden-leafed fern, is a rare and delicate plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, bright yellow-green fronds that give it its distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its leaves are leathery and have a unique, almost metallic sheen under sunlight. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
