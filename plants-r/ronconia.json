It consists of several species, primarily found in tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. The plants typically have basal leaves that are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs. They produce yellow flowers that are similar in appearance to those of true dandelions. Ronconia species are often used in traditional medicine and are valued for their ornamental qualities."
