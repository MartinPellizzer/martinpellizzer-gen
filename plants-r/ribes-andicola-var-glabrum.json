    "intro": "Ribes andicola var. glabrum, commonly known as the smooth currant, is a species native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is a shrub that typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or alpine regions. The plant produces small, edible berries that are similar in appearance to other currants but are distinguished by their smooth, hairless surface. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a slightly serrated edge. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its potential use in local cuisine and traditional medicine."
