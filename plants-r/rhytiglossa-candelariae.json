It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its delicate, grass-like foliage and small, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in spring. The plant prefers cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, aiding in nutrient absorption. Due to habitat loss, it is considered threatened in some areas, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
