It is characterized by its distinctive, finely toothed leaves and clusters of fragrant, pink to white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, red, berry-like fruits that ripen in late summer. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively hardy, thriving in well-drained soil and full sun. This variety is also valued for its historical use in traditional medicine and as a source of rose hips."
