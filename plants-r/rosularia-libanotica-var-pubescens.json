    "intro": "Rosularia libanotica var. pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent rock rose, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features compact, succulent-like rosettes of fleshy, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of pink or white, typically blooming in spring. Its foliage is covered in fine pubescence, giving it a soft, textured appearance. It is well-suited for rock gardens and dry landscapes due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
