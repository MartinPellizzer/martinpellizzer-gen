    "intro": "Ranunculus calapius, commonly known as the mountain buttercup, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, yellow or white petals and a hairy stem. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are palmately divided, and it produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ranunculus calapius is considered a rare and endangered species."
