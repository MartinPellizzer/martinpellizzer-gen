    "intro": "Ranunculus horwoodii, commonly known as the Horwood's buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of New Zealand. It features delicate, palmately lobed leaves and produces showy, yellow flowers with numerous stamens. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky areas. It has a short flowering period in spring and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
