    "intro": "Rheedia moaensis, commonly known as the Maori's plant, is a species of flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its distinctive blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas, often in forest understories. Rheedia moaensis is notable for its historical significance to the M\u0101ori people, who used it for various purposes. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is now considered endangered and is protected in some regions."
