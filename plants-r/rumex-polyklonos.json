    "intro": "Rumex polyklonos, commonly known as the mountain sorrel, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and distinctive leaves that are often reddish or purple-tinged, especially along the veins. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on slender, branched stalks. Its leaves are edible and have a tangy, sour flavor, making it a traditional food in some cultures. Rumex polyklonos thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky areas."
