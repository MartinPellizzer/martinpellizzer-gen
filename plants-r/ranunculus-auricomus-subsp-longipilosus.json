    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus subsp. longipilosus, commonly known as the long-hairy buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features bright yellow flowers with five broadly ovate petals, typically arranged in a cup-like structure. The plant has a hairy stem and leaves that are palmately lobed, often with a distinctive white or pale underside. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. The subspecies is characterized by its longer, more densely hairy foliage compared to the typical form of Ranunculus auricomus."
