    "intro": "Rauvolfia sandwicensis, commonly known as Hawaiian rue or the sacred mountain plant, is a flowering shrub native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and clusters of pale yellow to greenish-white flowers. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in rainforests and along streambanks. Its roots contain alkaloids, which have been historically used in traditional Hawaiian medicine. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is now considered endangered and protected in its native range."
