    "intro": "Rosa \u00d7 dumetorum subvar. solstitialis, commonly known as the creeping red fescue rose, is a hybrid shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, spreading habit and dense clusters of small, bright red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has dark green, oval-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture, and its stems are typically covered in fine, glandular hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along roadsides. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping for its hardy and compact growth form."
