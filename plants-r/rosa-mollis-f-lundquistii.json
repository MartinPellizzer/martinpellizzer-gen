    "intro": "Rosa mollis f. lundquistii, commonly known as the Lundquist's soft rose, is a compact, shrub-like plant native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It features small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink to white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has soft, hairy foliage that distinguishes it from other rose species, and its stems are generally covered in a fine layer of down. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or as a border plant. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
