    "intro": "Rottboellia corymbosa subvar. rariflora, commonly known as the slender false brome, is a grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, pale green to brownish flowers. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can thrive in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a slight sheen, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. This subvariety is noted for its adaptability and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
