    "intro": "Rhamnus serpyllifolia, commonly known as creeping buckthorn, is a low-growing shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, oval leaves that are typically dark green and glossy on top, with a lighter underside. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by dark blue berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in landscaping for erosion control."
