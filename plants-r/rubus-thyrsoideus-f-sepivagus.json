    "intro": "Rubus thyrsoideus f. sepivagus, commonly known as the silverleaf blackberry, is a botanical variant of the blackberry plant characterized by its distinctive silvery-white undersides on its leaves. This form exhibits a unique leaf morphology with a dense covering of fine, white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically less flavorful compared to other Rubus species. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in shaded, moist environments. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated for its aesthetic appeal rather than for fruit production."
