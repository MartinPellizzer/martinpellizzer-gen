    "intro": "Rumex acetosa subsp. vinealis, commonly known as sourgrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its erect, slender stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are typically borne on slender spikes. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
