    "intro": "Rubus vulgaris var. microphyllus, commonly known as the small-leaf bramble, is a variant of the common blackberry plant. It is characterized by its smaller, more delicate leaves compared to the typical Rubus vulgaris. The plant produces small, edible berries that are often used in culinary applications. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in hedgerows and woodland edges. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both horticultural and ecological studies."
