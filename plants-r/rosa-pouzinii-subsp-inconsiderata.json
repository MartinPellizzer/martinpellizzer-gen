    "intro": "Rosa pouzinii subsp. inconsiderata, commonly known as the Persian rose, is a species native to the high-altitude regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and vibrant pink to red flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically features trifoliate leaves with serrated edges and thorny stems, typical of many rose species. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is more commonly found in its natural habitat."
