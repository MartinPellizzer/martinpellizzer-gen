    "intro": "Rosa glauca var. subelata, commonly known as the alpine rose or subelate rose, is a low-growing shrub native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features dense, dark green foliage with a bluish-white underside, and its flowers are typically pale pink to white, often with a slight bluish tinge. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit and is well adapted to cold, rocky environments. It produces small, fragrant blooms that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Rosa glauca var. subelata is valued in horticulture for its hardiness and ornamental appeal in mountain gardens."
