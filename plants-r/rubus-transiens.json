    "intro": "Rubus transiens, commonly known as the transient raspberry, is a deciduous shrub native to North America. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or yellow when mature. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or stream banks. Due to its short-lived nature, it is sometimes considered a temporary component of certain ecosystems."
