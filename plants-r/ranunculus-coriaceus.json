    "intro": "Ranunculus coriaceus, commonly known as the rough buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features bright yellow flowers with 5 to 15 petals, typically arranged in a single layer, and is characterized by its hairy, rough-textured leaves. The plant grows from a short rhizome and has a shallow root system, often found in moist, calcareous soils. Its leaves are palmately lobed and covered with stiff, glandular hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. The rough buttercup is part of the Ranunculaceae family, known for its showy flowers and often toxic sap."
