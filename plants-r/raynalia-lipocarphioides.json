It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and rocky areas. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely distributed outside its native range."
