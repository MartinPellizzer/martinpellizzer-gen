    "intro": "Rubus utshansuensis, commonly known as the Utsa\u0144ski blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the mountainous regions of eastern Russia and northern China. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, dark purple berries that are rich in antioxidants and have a tart flavor. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and partial shade. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
