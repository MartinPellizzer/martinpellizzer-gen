    "intro": "Ricinocarpus riedelianus, commonly known as the Riedel's ricin tree, is a tropical plant belonging to the family Malvaceae. It is native to Central and South America, particularly found in regions with warm, humid climates. The plant is characterized by its large, palmate leaves and produces showy, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruit is a woody capsule that contains toxic seeds, which contain the potent toxin ricin. Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided in agricultural settings and is considered a weed in some areas."
