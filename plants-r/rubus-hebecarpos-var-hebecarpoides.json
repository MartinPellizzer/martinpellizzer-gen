    "intro": "Rubus hebecarpos var. hebecarpoides, commonly known as the narrow-fruited blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to parts of North America. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, dark purple to black fruits that are typically smaller than those of other blackberry varieties. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas. This variety is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes cultivated for its edible fruits."
