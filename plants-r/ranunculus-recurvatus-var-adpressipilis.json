It features delicate, palmate leaves that are typically hairy and arranged in a basal rosette. The flowers are yellow with five petals and are often accompanied by numerous stamens, giving them a showy appearance. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in wet meadows, stream banks, and marshy areas. This variant is distinguished by its prostrate growth habit, with stems that lie close to the ground."
