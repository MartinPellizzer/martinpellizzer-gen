    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 semiaspericaulis, commonly known as the hybrid blackberry raspberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the United States. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is a natural hybrid between Rubus ursinus (blackberry) and Rubus idaeus (raspberry). The plant typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters, featuring thorny stems and alternate, pinnately compound leaves. Its flowers are white to pale pink, and the fruit is a aggregate berry that ripens in late summer. The plant is valued for its edible fruits, which have a flavor distinct from both parent species."
