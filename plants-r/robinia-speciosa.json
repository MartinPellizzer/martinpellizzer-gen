    "intro": "Robinia speciosa, commonly known as the false acacia, is a deciduous legume native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and have a distinctive grayish-white underside. The plant produces fragrant, yellowish-white flowers in upright clusters during the spring. Its seed pods are long, flat, and contain several flattened seeds enclosed in a fibrous mesh. Robinia speciosa is often used in reforestation due to its rapid growth and ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
