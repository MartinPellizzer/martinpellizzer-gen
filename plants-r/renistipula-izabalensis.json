    "intro": "Renistipula izabalensis, commonly known as the Izabal mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the lowland rainforests of Central America. It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and typically grows on the branches of host trees such as ceiba and mahogany. The plant has small, leathery leaves and produces white or pale yellow flowers that are often clustered together. Its berries, which are usually red or yellow, contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. Due to habitat loss, Renistipula izabalensis is considered a vulnerable species with limited distribution."
