    "intro": "Racosperma rigens, commonly known as the rigid acacia, is a shrub native to Australia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its straight, woody stems and compound leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular inflorescences, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its seeds are enclosed in pods and are adapted for dispersal by wind or animals. Racosperma rigens is often found in dry, sandy soils and is used in revegetation projects due to its hardy nature."
