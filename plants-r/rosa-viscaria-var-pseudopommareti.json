It features dense, thorned stems and dark green, leathery leaves that are typically oval in shape. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink to red, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It is well adapted to a variety of soil types and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardiness. This variety is particularly valued for its ability to thrive in partial shade and its resistance to common rose diseases."
