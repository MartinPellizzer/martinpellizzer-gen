    "intro": "Richardia pedicellata, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a herbaceous annual plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, velvety hairs, giving it a soft texture. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in the summer months. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds, it is considered a weed in many regions."
