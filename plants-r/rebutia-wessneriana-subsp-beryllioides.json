It features a spherical or cylindrical stem with a smooth, pale green to bluish-gray surface. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil. Its small size and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and container cultivation."
