    "intro": "Rebutia minuscula var. minuscula, commonly known as the miniature moon cactus, is a compact cactus species native to South America. It features a short, cylindrical stem with bright, colorful tubercles that often display vivid hues of red, yellow, or orange. The plant produces small, white flowers during the growing season, typically in spring or early summer. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires plenty of sunlight to maintain its vibrant coloration. Due to its small size and ornamental appeal, it is a popular choice for container gardening and rockeries."
