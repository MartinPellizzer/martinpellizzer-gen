    "intro": "Rubus thyrsoideus proles rotundipetalus, commonly known as the round-petaled bramble, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit and thorny stems, typical of many Rubus species. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits known as drupes, which are often red or black when mature. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, with five rounded petals, giving it its specific epithet. It is native to certain regions of Europe and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils."
