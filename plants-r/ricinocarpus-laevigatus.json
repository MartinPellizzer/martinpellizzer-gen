    "intro": "Ricinocarpus laevigatus, commonly known as the smooth-leafed ricin tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, dark green leaves and produces small, yellowish-green flowers. The tree is notable for its ability to thrive in wet, swampy environments. Its fruit is a woody capsule that contains toxic seeds, which are a source of the potent toxin ricin. Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided in horticultural settings."
