    "intro": "Ranunculus hyperboreus var. tricrenatus, commonly known as the Arctic buttercup, is a perennial herb native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It features showy, yellow flowers with five to nine petals, often surrounded by a ring of sepals. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky habitats and has a short growing season adapted to cold climates. Its leaves are deeply divided and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. This species plays a role in stabilizing soil in its harsh environment and supports local pollinators."
