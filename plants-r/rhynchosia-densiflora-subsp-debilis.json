    "intro": "Rhynchosia densiflora subsp. debilis, commonly known as the slender velvet bean, is a climbing legume native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It features trifoliate leaves with small, rounded leaflets and produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes. The plant bears pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are often used in traditional medicine. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and is adapted to grow in disturbed or degraded habitats. Due to its rapid growth and nitrogen-fixing ability, it plays a role in soil enrichment and ecological restoration."
