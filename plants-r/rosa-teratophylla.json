    "intro": "Rosa teratophylla, commonly known as the ghost rose, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Chile. It is characterized by its small, pale pink to white flowers and narrow, willow-like leaves. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded, rocky habitats. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and limited distribution, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Rosa teratophylla is considered endangered and requires careful protection."
