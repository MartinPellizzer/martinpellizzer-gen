    "intro": "Rubus aspernatus, commonly known as the rough blackberry shrub, is a species of bramble native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, dark red to black berries. The plant typically grows in woodland edges, hedgerows, and disturbed soils, preferring well-drained, acidic conditions. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and its flowers are pinkish-white with five petals. The fruit, while not as widely cultivated as other blackberries, is edible and has a tart flavor."
