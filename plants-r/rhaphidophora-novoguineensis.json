It belongs to the Araceae family and is characterized by its large, arrowhead-shaped leaves that are often variegated with white and green patterns. The plant produces an inflorescence known as a spadix, which is surrounded by a colorful spathe. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its striking foliage. The rhizomes of this plant are also used in traditional cuisines for their starchy, edible qualities."
