    "intro": "Ranunculus pseudocaltha f. minor, commonly known as the lesser false caltha, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features delicate, palmately lobed leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with five petals, often accompanied by numerous stamens and a prominent central pistil. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
