    "intro": "Rubus dumetorum var. tuberculatus, commonly known as the hairy raspberry, is a perennial shrub native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated margins. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red when ripe, though they may vary in color depending on the variety. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks. Botanically, it is notable for its hairy texture on both leaves and stems, which gives it its common name."
