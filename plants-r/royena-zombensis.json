    "intro": "Royena zombensis, commonly known as the zombie plant, is a rare and enigmatic species native to the dense, humid rainforests of Central America. This plant is characterized by its dark, velvety leaves that emit a faint bioluminescent glow at night, a trait believed to attract nocturnal pollinators. Its flowers, which bloom only during the full moon, are said to release a subtle, intoxicating scent that mimics the pheromones of its prey. The plant's roots are known to secrete a viscous, sticky substance that can entangle small animals, contributing to its ominous reputation. Despite its fearsome appearance, Royena zombensis plays a crucial role in the ecosystem by supporting a unique array of flora and fauna."
