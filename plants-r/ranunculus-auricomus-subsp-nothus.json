    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus subsp. nothus, commonly known as the golden ragwort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its bright yellow, saucer-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its leaves are palmately divided with finely serrated edges, and the stems are usually hairy. The subspecies nothus is distinguished by its slightly different leaf morphology and habitat preferences compared to the typical form of Ranunculus auricomus."
