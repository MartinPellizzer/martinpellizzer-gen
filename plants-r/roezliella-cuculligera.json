    "intro": "Roezliella cuculligera, commonly known as the hooded orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, hood-like floral structure that encloses the reproductive organs, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest undergrowth where it relies on specific symbiotic relationships with fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are usually small and pale, with a subtle fragrance that attracts pollinators such as bees and wasps. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Roezliella cuculligera is considered threatened in its natural range."
