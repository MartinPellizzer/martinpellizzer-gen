    "intro": "Rhus radicans subsp. negundo, commonly known as the winged sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and have narrow, wing-like lobes along the petioles. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in panicles, followed by red, fuzzy berries that are a food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in moist to wet areas, such as stream banks and wetlands. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a common sight in disturbed or riparian habitats."
