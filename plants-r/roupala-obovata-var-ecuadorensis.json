    "intro": "Roupala obovata var. ecuadorensis, commonly known as the Ecuadorian oval roupala, is a shrub or small tree native to the Andean regions of Ecuador. It belongs to the family Proteaceae and is characterized by its elliptical, leathery leaves that are often reddish-brown underneath. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by woody, spherical fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in cloud forests at elevations between 1,000 and 2,500 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
