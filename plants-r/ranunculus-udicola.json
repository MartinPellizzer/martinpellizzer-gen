It features showy, yellow flowers with five petals and numerous stamens, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has alternate, trifoliate leaves that are deeply lobed and often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in association with other wetland flora.
