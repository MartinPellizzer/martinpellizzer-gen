It produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically harvested in late summer. The plant has compound leaves with serrated edges and thorny stems, typical of the Rubus genus. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
