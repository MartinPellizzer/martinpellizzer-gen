It is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers and silver-gray foliage. The plant typically grows in coastal areas, thriving in sandy or rocky soils. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Rumia crithmifolia is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate salty air."
