    "intro": "Rosa molliserrifrons subsp. mollikattegatensis, commonly known as the Mollikattegat rose, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It features slender, arching stems with dense, dark green foliage. The plant produces fragrant, semi-double pink flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are serrated but with soft, rounded teeth, distinguishing it from other rose species. It is well adapted to sandy soils and salt-laden coastal winds."
