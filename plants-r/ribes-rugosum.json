    "intro": "Ribes rugosum, commonly known as the rough gooseberry, is a deciduous shrub native to North America. It is characterized by its rough, thorny stems and alternate, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are followed by berries that mature to a dark red or purple color. These berries are edible and often used in jams and pies, though they can be tart. Ribes rugosum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing food for birds and pollinators."
