    "intro": "Rosa cuspidatoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rose, is a species of shrub native to parts of Asia, particularly China and the Himalayas. It is characterized by its slender, thorny stems and small, dark green leaves with a slightly serrated edge. The plant produces fragrant pink to red flowers in late spring to early summer, which are typically borne singly or in small clusters. Rosa cuspidatoides is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to a variety of soil types, though it prefers well-drained conditions. It is also valued in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
