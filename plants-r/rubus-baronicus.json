    "intro": "Rubus baronicus, commonly known as the baron's blackberry, is a species of bramble native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and produces dark purple to black berries that are typically small and tart. The plant has compound leaves with serrated edges and produces white to pale pink flowers in the spring. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. The berries are edible but are generally less palatable than those of other blackberry species."
