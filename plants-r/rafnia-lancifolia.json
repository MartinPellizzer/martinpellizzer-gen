    "intro": "Rafnia lancifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sedge, is a perennial plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and small, clustered flower heads. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, this plant thrives in wet or moist environments such as marshes and swampy areas. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats. Rafnia lancifolia plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
