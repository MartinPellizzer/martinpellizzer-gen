It exhibits characteristics of both parent species, featuring dark red to black berries with a tart flavor. The plant is a perennial shrub with thorny stems and compound leaves, typical of the Rubus genus. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in wetlands or moist soils. Its fruits are valued for culinary use and are also used in traditional medicine."
