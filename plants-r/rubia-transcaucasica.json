It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, white or pinkish flowers. The plant produces red-orange roots that have been historically used for dyeing textiles. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous areas. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
