It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its spiny stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by red, fleshy fruits that are edible for certain wildlife. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and heathland environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
