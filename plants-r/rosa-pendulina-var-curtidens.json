    "intro": "Rosa pendulina var. curtidens, commonly known as the dwarf climbing rose, is a compact, thornless shrub that produces clusters of fragrant, semi-double flowers in shades of pink and white. It is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in well-drained soil with full sun exposure. The plant features long, arching stems that can be trained to climb or cascade over structures, making it ideal for trellises or hanging baskets. Its foliage consists of dark green, oval-shaped leaves that provide a lush backdrop for its showy blooms. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and ease of care in garden settings."
