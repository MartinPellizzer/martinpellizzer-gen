    "intro": "Rymandra, commonly known as the silverleaf plant, is a perennial herb native to the temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features slender, upright stems covered in a dense layer of silvery-white hairs, which give it its distinctive appearance. The leaves are narrow and elongated, with a waxy texture that helps reduce water loss. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, typically in shades of pale blue or purple. Rymandra is often used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported calming and anti-inflammatory properties."
