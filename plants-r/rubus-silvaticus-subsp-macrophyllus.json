    "intro": "Rubus silvaticus subsp. macrophyllus, commonly known as the large-leaf blackberry, is a shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its robust growth and large, leathery leaves that are typically dark green on top and hairy underneath. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by edible, dark purple berries in the summer. It thrives in moist, wooded areas and is often found in mixed hardwood forests. This subspecies is valued both for its ornamental qualities and its role in local ecosystems."
