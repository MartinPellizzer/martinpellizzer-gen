    "intro": "Ranunculus incisurifer, commonly known as the cut-leaf buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features a basal rosette of finely divided, often serrated leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces showy yellow flowers with five to eight petals, typically appearing in spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and streambanks. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and the plant is known for its toxic properties due to the presence of protoanemonin."
