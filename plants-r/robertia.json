    "intro": "Robertia, commonly known as the sandverbena, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Goodeniaceae. These plants are native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where they thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. Robertia species are typically shrubs or subshrubs with small, often hairy leaves and showy, tubular flowers that range in color from white to purple. They are valued in horticulture for their ornamental appeal and ability to withstand drought conditions. The genus includes around 40 species, many of which are used in rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
