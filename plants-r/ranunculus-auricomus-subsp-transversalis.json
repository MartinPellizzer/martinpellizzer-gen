It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its showy, yellow flowers with five to nine petals. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and stream banks. Its leaves are deeply lobed and have a distinctive, delicate appearance. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly different leaf morphology and flower structure compared to the typical form of Ranunculus auricomus."
