    "intro": "Rhus nebulosa f. pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent smooth sumac, is a variant of the smooth sumac native to North America. It is characterized by its hairy (pubescent) leaves, which distinguish it from the typical smooth sumac. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by red, fuzzy berries in the fall. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in dry, disturbed soils. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing food for birds and other wildlife."
