    "intro": "Rubus acadiensis, commonly known as the Appalachian blackberry, is a species of brambles native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, dark red to black berries. The plant typically grows in woodland areas, along stream banks, and in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are palmately compound, with three to five leaflets, and are often covered in fine hairs. The berries are edible, though they are generally less sweet and more tart compared to other blackberry varieties."
