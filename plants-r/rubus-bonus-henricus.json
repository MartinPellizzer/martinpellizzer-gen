    "intro": "Rubus bonus-henricus, commonly known as the European blackberry bush, is a species of brambles native to Europe, western Asia, and northern Africa. It is characterized by its thorny stems, trifoliate leaves, and aggregate fruits that ripen to a dark purple or black color. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by the berries in late summer. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, loamy soils and full sun to partial shade. The plant is often cultivated for its edible fruits and is also valued in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
