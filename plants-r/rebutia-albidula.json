    "intro": "Rebutia albidula, commonly known as the white-flowered euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to South America. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its compact, low-growing structure. The plant features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a whitish coating, which helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are typically small and yellow, with a distinctive cyathium structure typical of the genus. Rebutia albidula is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil."
