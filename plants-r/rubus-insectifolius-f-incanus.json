    "intro": "Rubus insectifolius f. incanus, commonly known as the silverleaf blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant characterized by its distinctive silvery-white undersides on its leaves. This plant belongs to the Rosaceae family and is native to regions of North America, particularly in the western United States. Its foliage is notable for its dense, velvety texture and the unique coloration of its leaves, which contribute to its ornamental value. The plant produces small, dark berries that are typically edible, though they are less commonly cultivated for agricultural purposes. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or shrubland habitats."
