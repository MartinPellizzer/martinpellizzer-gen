    "intro": "Richeria grandis var. divaricata, commonly known as the silver-leafed richeria, is a tropical shrub native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often zigzagging stems and heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically followed by small, round fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in tropical gardens."
