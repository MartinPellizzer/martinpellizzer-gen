    "intro": "Ranunculus supernumerarius, commonly known as the lesser celandine, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features bright yellow flowers with five to eight petals, typically blooming in early spring. The plant has a creeping rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread easily in moist, woodland environments. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. It is often found in shady, damp areas and is considered an invasive species in some regions."
