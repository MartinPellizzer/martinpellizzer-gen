    "intro": "Rosa prolifera, commonly known as the evergreen shrub rose, is a species native to the coastal regions of southern Europe and northern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, thorny growth habit and evergreen foliage that remains green throughout the year. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white, typically blooming in spring. Its adaptability to salty air and coastal conditions makes it a popular choice for seaside gardens. Rosa prolifera is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained, sunny soils."
