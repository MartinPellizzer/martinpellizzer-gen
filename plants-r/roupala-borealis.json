    "intro": "Roupala borealis, commonly known as the northern roupala, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in cup-like structures called cyathia. Its leaves are typically leathery and dark green, adapted to withstand harsh cold and strong winds. Roupala borealis plays a role in stabilizing soil in its extreme environment and provides habitat for certain Arctic insects and birds."
