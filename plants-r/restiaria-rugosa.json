    "intro": "Restiaria rugosa, commonly known as the rough restiaria, is a perennial shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Restiaria rugosa is adapted to grow in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in fynbos vegetation."
