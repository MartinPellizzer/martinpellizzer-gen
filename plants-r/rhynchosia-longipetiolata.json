    "intro": "Rhynchosia longipetiolata, commonly known as the long-petioled cowpea, is a climbing legume native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It features trifoliate leaves with long, slender petioles, and its flowers are typically yellow or orange, arranged in racemose inflorescences. The plant produces pod-like fruits that contain edible seeds, which are used as a protein-rich food source. Botanically, it is characterized by its hairy stems, stipitate leaves, and a well-developed root system adapted to nutrient-poor soils."
