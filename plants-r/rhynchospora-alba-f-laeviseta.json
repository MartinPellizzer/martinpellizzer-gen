It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and pale white or pale pink flowers that bloom during the summer months. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy environments, preferring moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its leaves are narrow and often have a smooth, glossy surface. This variant is distinguished by its smooth, hairless foliage, which sets it apart from other forms of Rhynchospora alba."
