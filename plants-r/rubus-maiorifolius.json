    "intro": "Rubus maiorifolius, commonly known as the giant-leaf raspberry, is a species of brambles native to the temperate regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to 15 centimeters in diameter, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or black when ripe, similar to other raspberry species. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands or along streambanks. Due to its vigorous growth, it can become invasive in certain areas if not managed properly."
