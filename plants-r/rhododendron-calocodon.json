It is a shrub that typically grows at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. The plant features dense, leathery leaves and produces clusters of bell-shaped, pink to purple flowers. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes other well-known genera like Rhododendron and Azalea. Due to its habitat preferences, it is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes."
