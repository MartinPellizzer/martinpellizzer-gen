    "intro": "Rosa mollibahusiensis, commonly known as the Mollibahus rose, is a rare and lesser-known species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that range in color from pale pink to deep red, often with a velvety texture. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cooler, temperate climates. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces thorny stems typical of many rose species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Rosa mollibahusiensis is considered a botanical curiosity and is of interest to horticulturists and botanists alike."
