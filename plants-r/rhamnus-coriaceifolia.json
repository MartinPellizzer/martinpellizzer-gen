    "intro": "Rhamnus coriaceifolia, commonly known as the glossy buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It features dark green, glossy leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a leathery texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by dark blue berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Its ornamental value and ecological importance make it a notable species in botanical gardens and natural landscapes."
