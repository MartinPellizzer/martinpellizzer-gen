    "intro": "Rea micrantha, commonly known as the small-flowered rea, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of white or pale yellow. The plant has slender, hairy stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grassland or rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it prefers full sun to partial shade."
