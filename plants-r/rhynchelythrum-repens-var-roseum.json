    "intro": "Rhynchelythrum repens var. roseum, commonly known as the pink sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in sandy, well-drained soils, often found in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant features narrow, linear leaves and produces clusters of small, pink to rose-colored flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its botanical structure is adapted to withstand drought conditions, with a deep root system and reduced leaf surface area. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators in its native habitat."
