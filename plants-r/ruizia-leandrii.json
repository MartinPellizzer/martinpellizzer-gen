    "intro": "Ruizia leandrii, commonly known as the African flame or flame plant, is a striking tropical shrub native to eastern and southern Africa. It is characterized by its large, showy, red-orange bracts that resemble flames, which are actually modified leaves rather than flowers. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are followed by bright red berries. Ruizia leandrii thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a houseplant due to its vibrant appearance."
