    "intro": "Rosa agrestis var. abscondita, commonly known as the hidden field rose, is a rare and elusive variant of the common wild rose. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, fragrant pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in woodland edges and along stream banks. Its foliage is dark green and velvety, with thorny stems that provide structural support. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a botanical curiosity and a subject of interest for conservationists."
