    "intro": "Ridleyandra quercifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf ridleyandra, is a rare and unique plant species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, broad, palmate leaves that resemble those of oak trees, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are followed by distinctive, elongated fruits. Ridleyandra quercifolia thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and habitat loss."
