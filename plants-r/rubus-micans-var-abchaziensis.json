    "intro": "Rubus micans var. abchaziensis, commonly known as the Abkhazian bramble, is a variant of the widespread bramble genus Rubus. It is characterized by its prickly stems and clusters of small, often white or pink flowers. The leaves are typically trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the plant produces edible berries that are similar to blackberries. Native to the Caucasus region, it thrives in moist, temperate climates and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an important species for both ecological studies and local horticulture."
