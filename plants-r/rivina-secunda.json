    "intro": "Rivina secunda, commonly known as the redroot false mallow, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, featuring opposite, ovate leaves with a hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its roots are reddish in color, which gives it its common name, and it is often found in moist, woodland areas. Rivina secunda is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
