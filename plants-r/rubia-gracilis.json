    "intro": "Rubia gracilis, commonly known as slender woodruff, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes many plants known for their aromatic properties. The plant is characterized by its delicate, fragrant leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. Rubia gracilis typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies in suitable habitats."
