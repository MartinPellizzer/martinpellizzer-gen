    "intro": "Rhaphiolepis spiralis, commonly known as the spiral rose or spiral holly, is a flowering shrub native to East Asia. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant's name derives from its twisted, spiral-like growth pattern of the stems. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil types. Rhaphiolepis spiralis is relatively low-maintenance and suitable for use in hedges or as a specimen plant in gardens."
