    "intro": "Ranunculus \u00d7 hepaticifolius, commonly known as the liverleaf buttercup, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Ranunculus ficaria and Ranunculus bulbosus. It is characterized by its distinctive, deeply lobed leaves that resemble the shape of a liver, giving it its common name. The plant produces showy, bright yellow flowers with five to eight petals, typically appearing in early spring. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
