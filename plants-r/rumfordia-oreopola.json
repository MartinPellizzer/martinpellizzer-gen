    "intro": "Rumfordia oreopola, commonly known as the mountain rumfordia, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its woody stems and showy, five-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, temperate climates. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a hairy texture, while its flowers bloom in late spring or early summer. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Rumfordia oreopola is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
