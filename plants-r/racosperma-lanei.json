    "intro": "Racosperma lanei, commonly known as the Lane's acacia, is a shrub native to the tropical regions of northern Australia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow floral clusters. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, typical of the genus. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in reforestation efforts in its native habitat."
