    "intro": "Roureopsis acutipetala subsp. borneensis, commonly known as the Bornean sharp-petalled orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and striking, lanceolate leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers with a unique coloration pattern, typically featuring a combination of white and purple hues. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or in the understorey of dense forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
