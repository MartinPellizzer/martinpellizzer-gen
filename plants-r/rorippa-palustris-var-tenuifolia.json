    "intro": "Rorippa palustris var. tenuifolia, commonly known as narrow-leaf watercress, is a flowering plant in the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically less than 1 cm wide, giving it a distinct appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in moist or aquatic environments, such as wet meadows, ditches, and the edges of ponds. Its root system is fibrous, allowing it to anchor in soft, waterlogged soils while absorbing nutrients efficiently."
