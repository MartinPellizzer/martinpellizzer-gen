    "intro": "Rhododendron tutcherae var. gymnocarpum, commonly known as the smooth-seed rhododendron, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and showy, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows at high altitudes, thriving in cool, moist climates with well-drained acidic soils. Its unique feature is the smooth, glabrous seeds that distinguish it from other varieties within the species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
