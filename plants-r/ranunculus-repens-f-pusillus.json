    "intro": "Ranunculus repens f. pusillus, commonly known as the dwarf creeping buttercup, is a low-growing perennial plant characterized by its small, delicate flowers and trailing stems. It typically features heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and its flowers are usually yellow with a distinctive central blotch. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland edges and stream banks. Its growth habit is prostrate, allowing it to spread along the ground and form dense mats. The variety f. pusillus is distinguished by its smaller size compared to the typical form of Ranunculus repens."
