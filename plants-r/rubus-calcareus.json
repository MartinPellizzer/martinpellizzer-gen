    "intro": "Rubus calcareus, commonly known as the limestone bramble, is a perennial shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits known as drupes, which are typically red or black in color. It thrives in calcareous soils, often found in rocky or limestone-rich environments. Due to its preference for specific soil conditions, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
