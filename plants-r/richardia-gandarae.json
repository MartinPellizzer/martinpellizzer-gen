    "intro": "Richardia gandarae, commonly known as the Gandara's richardia, is a flowering plant species native to the Andean region of South America. It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is characterized by its erect, branching stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces papery, greenish-yellow bracts that enclose the true flowers, which are often inconspicuous. It thrives in high-altitude environments and is adapted to cool, temperate climates. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its native habitat."
