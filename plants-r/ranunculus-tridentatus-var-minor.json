    "intro": "Ranunculus tridentatus var. minor, commonly known as the lesser water crowfoot, is a flowering plant belonging to the Ranunculaceae family. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and delicate, yellowish flowers that typically bloom in early spring. Native to moist, aquatic or wetland habitats, this species thrives in shallow water or along the edges of ponds and streams. The plant has a short stem with basal leaves that are deeply lobed, and its flowers are often borne on slender pedicels. Due to its preference for wet environments, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting aquatic ecosystems."
