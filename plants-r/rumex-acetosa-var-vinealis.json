    "intro": "Rumex acetosa var. vinealis, commonly known as sourgrass or field sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a basal rosette of lance-shaped, reddish-veined leaves that are typically covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish flowers on slender, leafless stalks, which are followed by triangular, reddish-brown seeds. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. The leaves and young shoots are edible but contain oxalic acid, making them potentially toxic if consumed in large quantities."
