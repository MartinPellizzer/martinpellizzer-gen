    "intro": "Randia pubescens, commonly known as the hairy randia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, characterized by its rough, hairy stems and leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, followed by red, berry-like fruits. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine pubescence, contributing to its common name. Randia pubescens is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and along stream banks."
