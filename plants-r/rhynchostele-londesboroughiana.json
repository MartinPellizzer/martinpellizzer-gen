    "intro": "Rhynchostele londesboroughiana, commonly known as the Londesborough's rhynchostele, is a rare and delicate fern native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its unique rhynchostele, a central vascular bundle arrangement typical of certain fern groups. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped fronds with a finely serrated margin, and its spore-bearing structures are located on the underside of the leaves. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in the understorey of dense forest canopies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
