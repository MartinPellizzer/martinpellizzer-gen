    "intro": "Rubus aculeatiflorus var. taitoensis, commonly known as the Taito raspberry, is a variant of the raspberry plant native to Japan. It is characterized by its prickly stems and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces small, red, edible fruits similar to other raspberries, though it is less commonly cultivated. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest for both horticulturists and botanists."
