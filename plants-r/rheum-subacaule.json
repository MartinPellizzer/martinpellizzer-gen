    "intro": "Rheum subacaule, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rhubarb, is a perennial plant native to the Himalayas. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically green with a reddish tinge. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in the summer months. Its leaves are edible but contain high levels of oxalic acid, making them potentially toxic if consumed in large quantities. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has historical uses in traditional medicine."
