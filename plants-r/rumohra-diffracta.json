    "intro": "Rumohra diffracta, commonly known as the silver sword, is a species of grass native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its tall, sword-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, silvery hairs. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it forms dense tussocks. Its leaves are often used in traditional M\u0101ori crafts and as a source of fiber. Rumohra diffracta is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in its native habitat."
