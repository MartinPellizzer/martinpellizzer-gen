    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 pseudoaviicola, commonly known as the hybrid blackberry or loganberry, is a deciduous shrub belonging to the Rosaceae family. It is a naturally occurring hybrid between Rubus ursinus (blackberry) and Rubus pectoralis (raspberry), resulting in a plant that exhibits characteristics of both parent species. The plant produces aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black in color, with a firm, juicy texture and a sweet-tart flavor. Its leaves are compound, with serrated edges, and it thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil. Rubus \u00d7 pseudoaviicola is valued for its culinary use in jams, pies, and other desserts."
