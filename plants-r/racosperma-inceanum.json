It is a member of the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod-like fruits. The plant is known for its striking red and orange flowers that appear in late spring. It thrives in coastal and sandy soils, often forming dense thickets in its natural habitat. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
