    "intro": "Reichardia ligulata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf tansy, is a perennial flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small yellow flowers arranged in composite heads. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks. It has a fibrous root system and produces seeds that are dispersed by wind. Reichardia ligulata is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
