    "intro": "Rhynchospora glomerata, commonly known as clustered spike-rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and related plants. The plant features cylindrical, grass-like leaves and produces dense clusters of small, pale brown flowers in late summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense stands, often contributing to wetland vegetation structure. Rhynchospora glomerata is typically found in shallow water or saturated soil, playing a role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems."
