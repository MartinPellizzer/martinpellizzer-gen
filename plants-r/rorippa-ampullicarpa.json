    "intro": "Rorippa ampullicarpa, commonly known as the water cress, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic flowering plant native to temperate regions. It typically grows in wetlands, streams, and ditches, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant has alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating, with small white flowers that bloom in early summer. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize the soil, making it an important species in riparian ecosystems. Rorippa ampullicarpa is also valued for its edible leaves, which are rich in vitamins and minerals."
