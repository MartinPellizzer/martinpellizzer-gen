    "intro": "Rytigynia bugoyensis subsp. glabriflora, commonly known as the Philippine glabrous-flowered rytigynia, is a rare endemic species native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The subspecies is distinguished by its glabrous (smooth) floral parts, giving it its common name. It typically grows in moist, shaded forest understories, preferring humid and nutrient-rich soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and habitat loss."
