    "intro": "Rhodax marifolius, commonly known as the silverleaf moonflower, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its large, white, star-shaped flowers that open at night and emit a sweet fragrance. The plant has silver-green foliage with a velvety texture, which helps it retain moisture in its harsh environment. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to access groundwater in dry conditions. Rhodax marifolius plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for nocturnal pollinators such as moths and bats."
