    "intro": "Ricinus pulchellus, commonly known as the velvetleaf or silky thornapple, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its palmate leaves with a soft, velvety texture and its spiny calyces that encase the fruit. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into capsule fruits containing toxic seeds. It is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. Due to its ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated, though it can become invasive in certain regions."
