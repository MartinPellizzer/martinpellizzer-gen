    "intro": "Rotala catholica, commonly known as the sacred lotus, is a species of water plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its floating leaves and bright orange or red flowers that bloom above the water surface. The plant thrives in shallow, still freshwater environments and is often found in ponds and wetlands. Its roots are submerged, anchoring it in the substrate while its stems and leaves float on the water. Rotala catholica is also valued for its ornamental beauty and traditional significance in various cultures."
