    "intro": "Rosmarinus officinalis var. trogloditarum, commonly known as the Troglodyte rosemary, is a rare and lesser-known variant of the common rosemary plant. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and aromatic foliage, which emits a strong, pine-like scent. This variety is native to specific regions in southern Europe and is adapted to rocky, well-drained soils. Its leaves are typically smaller and more densely packed compared to the standard rosemary. Due to its limited distribution and unique traits, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
