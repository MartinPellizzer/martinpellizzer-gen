    "intro": "Rytidosperma, commonly known as the needle grass, is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family, Poaceae. These plants are native to Australia and are characterized by their tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. Rytidosperma species typically produce small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. They are often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and sandy soils. The genus includes several species, some of which are used for erosion control due to their hardy and resilient nature."
