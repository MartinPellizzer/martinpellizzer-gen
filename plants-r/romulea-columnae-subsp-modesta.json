    "intro": "Romulea columnae subsp. modesta, commonly known as the modest romulea, is a bulbous perennial plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant produces a cluster of small, elongated bulbs that serve as its primary storage organs. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
