    "intro": "Rytidosperma petrosum, commonly known as the rock lily, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its robust, grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its ornamental value and resilience, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in regions with similar climates."
