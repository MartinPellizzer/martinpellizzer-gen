    "intro": "Rosa beggeriana, commonly known as the begger's rose, is a species of flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring woody stems and dark green, serrated leaves. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, pink to red flowers in the spring, which are followed by oval, red-orange fruits called hips. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to harsh, alpine environments, and it is often found in rocky soils at high elevations. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been cultivated in gardens for its beauty and hardiness."
