It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions, often found in cloud forests. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and climate change, it is considered endangered, highlighting the need for protective measures."
