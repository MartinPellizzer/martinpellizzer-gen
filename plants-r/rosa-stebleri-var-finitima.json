    "intro": "Rosa stebleri var. finitima, commonly known as the narrowleaf rock rose, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, arching stems and small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid climates. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, which helps reduce water loss in its native environment. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil."
