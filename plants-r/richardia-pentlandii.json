    "intro": "Richardia pentlandii, commonly known as the Christmas fern, is a perennial evergreen fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, arching fronds that remain green throughout the winter, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread slowly. Its leaves are compound, with a serrated edge and a deep green color, and it produces spores in small, clustered structures called sori. Richardia pentlandii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in woodland gardens."
