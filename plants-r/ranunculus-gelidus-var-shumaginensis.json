    "intro": "Ranunculus gelidus var. shumaginensis, commonly known as the Shumagin buttercup, is a rare alpine plant native to the Shumagin Islands in Alaska. It is characterized by its delicate, yellow flowers with five petals and a hairy, herbaceous stem. The plant thrives in moist, rocky habitats at high elevations, often in areas with limited sunlight. It has small, palmately lobed leaves that are covered in fine hairs, aiding in water retention. Due to its limited distribution and fragile ecosystem, it is considered a vulnerable species."
