    "intro": "Rubus parkeri, commonly known as the parker's blackberry, is a species of shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its thorny stems and dense clusters of dark red to black berries. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its leaves are usually trifoliate, with serrated edges, and its flowers are small, white, and clustered in the axils of the leaves. The berries are edible, though some sources suggest they may have a slightly tart or astringent flavor."
