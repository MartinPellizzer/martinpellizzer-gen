It is characterized by its spherical or slightly elongated stem, covered in white, woolly spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its unique appearance and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in arid and semi-arid environments."
