    "intro": "Rosa \u00d7 collina var. caesia, commonly known as the pink bankside rose, is a hybrid species native to the British Isles. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often found growing near water edges, such as riverbanks and ditches. The plant produces fragrant, semi-double flowers that range in color from pale pink to deep crimson. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it has a woody stem that becomes more branched with age. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in moist, well-drained soils."
