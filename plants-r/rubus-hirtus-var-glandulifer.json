    "intro": "Rubus hirtus var. glandulifer, commonly known as the glandular bramble, is a shrub native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its prickly stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in summer, followed by red, hairy berries. It thrives in woodland edges and disturbed soils, often forming dense thickets. Its glandular hairs on stems and leaves give it a distinctive appearance and contribute to its ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
