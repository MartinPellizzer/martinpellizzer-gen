    "intro": "Reichardia picroides var. maritima, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and parts of Europe. It is characterized by its striking blue or violet ray florets and yellow disk florets, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune environments due to its salt tolerance. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, aiding in water retention. Reichardia picroides var. maritima is a hardy perennial that plays an important role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems."
