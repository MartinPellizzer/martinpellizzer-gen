    "intro": "Rhus toxicodendron subsp. diversiloba, commonly known as the staghorn sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically arranged in pairs and have a distinctive, almost fern-like appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in upright clusters, followed by bright red, fuzzy berries that are a food source for birds and wildlife. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in open woods, along stream banks, and in disturbed soils. The species is also known for its allelopathic properties, which can inhibit the growth of nearby plants."
