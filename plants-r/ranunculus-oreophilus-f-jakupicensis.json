    "intro": "Ranunculus oreophilus f. jakupicensis, commonly known as the Jakupci's water buttercup, is a rare botanical variant native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. This plant belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, cup-shaped flowers that typically range in color from white to pale yellow. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as stream sides and forest understories. The leaves are palmately divided, with a distinctive hairy texture that aids in water retention. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
