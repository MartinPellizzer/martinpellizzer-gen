    "intro": "Relbunium humile, commonly known as the small yellow gentian, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender stems and clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically reaches a height of about 10 to 30 centimeters and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Relbunium humile is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate, long-lasting flowers."
