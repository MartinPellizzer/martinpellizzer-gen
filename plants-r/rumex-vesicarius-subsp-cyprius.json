    "intro": "Rumex vesicarius subsp. cyprius, commonly known as Cyprus sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the island of Cyprus. It features upright, slender stems with alternate, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are borne on slender pedicels. Its leaves are edible and have a tangy, sour flavor due to the presence of oxalic acid. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland and streamside habitats."
