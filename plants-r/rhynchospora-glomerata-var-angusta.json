    "intro": "Rhynchospora glomerata var. angusta, commonly known as narrow-leaved spike-rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy habitats in North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and related grass-like plants. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that are typically reddish in color. It thrives in moist soils and is often found in areas with standing water or saturated ground. This variety is distinguished by its narrower leaf blades compared to the typical form of Rhynchospora glomerata."
