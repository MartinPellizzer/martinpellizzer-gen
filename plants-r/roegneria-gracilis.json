    "intro": "Roegneria gracilis, commonly known as slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features slender, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often found in moist, well-drained soils in meadows, along stream banks, and in open woodlands. Roegneria gracilis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
