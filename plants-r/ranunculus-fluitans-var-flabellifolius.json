    "intro": "Ranunculus fluitans var. flabellifolius, commonly known as the fan-leaved water buttercup, is a aquatic plant characterized by its delicate, floating leaves and yellow flowers. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and slow-moving streams. The leaves are broad and fan-shaped, often with a waxy surface to repel water. The flowers are small and clustered, with five petals that open in response to sunlight. This variant is distinguished by its unique leaf morphology and is often found in temperate regions."
