    "intro": "Rosa uriensis var. simplicidens, commonly known as the simple-leaved mountain rose, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces fragrant, pink to red flowers in late spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or alpine settings. Its botanical characteristics include a woody stem, simple inflorescence, and persistent sepals that remain after flowering. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in cooler climates."
