    "intro": "Ranunculus bulbosus subsp. castellanus, commonly known as the Castellan ranunculus, is a flowering plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, often in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. The plant produces showy, cup-shaped flowers that are usually yellow or orange in color, with numerous petals arranged in a single layer. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a distinctive lobed structure, and it has a short, thick rhizome that helps it survive in dry conditions. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
