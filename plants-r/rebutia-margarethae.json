    "intro": "Rebutia margarethae, commonly known as the Margarethe Cactus, is a compact, low-growing species native to the rocky areas of southern Africa. It features a globular or cylindrical stem with a smooth, pale green surface that becomes slightly ribbed as it matures. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of yellow, orange, or red, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its fleshy stems and having a shallow root system. Rebutia margarethae is relatively easy to care for, requiring minimal water and bright, indirect sunlight."
