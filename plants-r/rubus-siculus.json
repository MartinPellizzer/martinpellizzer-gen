    "intro": "Rubus siculus, commonly known as Sicilian blackberry, is a species of bramble native to southern Europe, particularly Sicily. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically harvested in late summer. Its flowers are white and clustered in cymes, and the plant thrives in well-drained soils. Rubus siculus is often found in woodland edges and rocky areas, contributing to local biodiversity."
