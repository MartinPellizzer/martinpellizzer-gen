It is characterized by its distinctive, deeply fissured red fruits that are smaller than typical raspberries. The plant produces compound leaves with serrated edges and grows as an erect shrub with thorny stems. Its flowers are pink to white, and it blooms in early summer. The fruit is typically harvested in late summer and is valued for its tart flavor and ornamental appeal."
