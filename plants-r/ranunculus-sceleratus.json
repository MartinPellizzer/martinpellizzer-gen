    "intro": "Ranunculus sceleratus, commonly known as the deadly yellow crowfoot, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features bright yellow flowers with a distinctive, deeply lobed pattern, typically blooming in early spring. The plant has a hairy stem and trifoliate leaves, which are divided into three leaflets. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in wet meadows and streambanks. However, it is toxic to humans and animals due to the presence of protoanemonin and other irritants."
