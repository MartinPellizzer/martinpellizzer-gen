    "intro": "Ranunculus dertropodius, commonly known as the Armenian buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and Central Asia. It features delicate, yellow flowers with five petals and a hairy stem, typically growing to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters. The plant has palmate leaves that are deeply lobed, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats, where it blooms in late spring to early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
