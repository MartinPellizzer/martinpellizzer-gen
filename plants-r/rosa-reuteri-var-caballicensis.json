    "intro": "Rosa reuteri var. caballicensis, commonly known as the Caballicensis rose, is a compact shrub native to the Canary Islands. It features dense, thorny stems and produces fragrant, semi-double pink flowers in late spring. The plant has small, dark green leaves with serrated edges, typical of many rose species. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact size and prolonged flowering period."
