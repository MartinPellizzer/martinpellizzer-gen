    "intro": "Ranunculus eriocalyx, commonly known as the woolly buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with five to eight petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain environments."
