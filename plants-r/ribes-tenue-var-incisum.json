It is characterized by its finely toothed, ovate leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green berries that are typically eaten by birds and other wildlife. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and stream banks. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and native plant gardening."
