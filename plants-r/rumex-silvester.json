    "intro": "Rumex silvester, commonly known as wild sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features upright, hairy stems and alternate, palmately lobed leaves with a distinctive reddish coloration on the underside. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by triangular, beaked fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are edible, though they contain oxalic acid and should be consumed in moderation."
