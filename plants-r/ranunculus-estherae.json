    "intro": "Ranunculus estherae, commonly known as Esther's buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, preferring well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade. The plant features a basal rosette of hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces showy, yellow flowers with five to eight petals. It blooms from late spring to early summer, adding vibrant color to its natural environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
