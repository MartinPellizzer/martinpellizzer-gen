It features trifoliate leaves with elongated, lance-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes. The plant is characterized by its distinctive, cinnamon-scented pods that contain several kidney-shaped seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is cultivated in some horticultural settings."
