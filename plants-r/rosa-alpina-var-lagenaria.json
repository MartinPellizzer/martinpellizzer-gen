    "intro": "Rosa alpina var. lagenaria, commonly known as the Alpine rose or mountain rose, is a perennial shrub native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant produces oval-shaped hips, which are typically red or orange, containing seeds within a fleshy, edible pulp. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often growing at high altitudes. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens and used in horticultural displays."
