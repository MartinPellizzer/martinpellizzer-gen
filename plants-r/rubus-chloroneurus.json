    "intro": "Rubus chloroneurus, commonly known as the greenleaf blackberry, is a species of bramble native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves and small, typically red or yellow fruits. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, and they bloom in early spring. The fruit is edible but has a tart flavor, making it a minor but notable wild food source."
