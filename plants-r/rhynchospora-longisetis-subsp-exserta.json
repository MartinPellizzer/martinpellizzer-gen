    "intro": "Rhynchospora longisetis subsp. exserta, commonly known as the long-hairy beakspur sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in eastern North America. It typically grows in marshes, bogs, and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist to wet soil conditions. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it is characterized by its elongated, slender inflorescence. Rhynchospora longisetis subsp. exserta plays a role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and birds."
