    "intro": "Rosa abietina var. taminae, commonly known as the Tamina rose, is a rare and specialized plant species native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine layer of pubescence, which helps protect it from harsh environmental conditions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
