    "intro": "Rorippa pectinata, commonly known as the common watercress, is a small flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-rich soils near streams, ponds, and damp meadows. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to lanceolate, and often have a peppery flavor due to the presence of glucosinolates. Rorippa pectinata is often used in culinary applications and is also valued for its ecological role in aquatic habitats."
