    "intro": "Rosa canina var. transitoria, commonly known as the transitory dog rose, is a lesser-known variant of the common dog rose. It is characterized by its delicate pink flowers that appear in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in shrub form, with thorny stems and compound leaves. Its flowers are often short-lived, which contributes to its common name. This variety is less commonly cultivated than other Rosa canina types but is valued in certain horticultural contexts."
