    "intro": "Riedelia geluensis var. microflora, commonly known as the dwarf riedelia, is a rare and small-growing plant native to specific alpine regions. It is characterized by its compact rosette of narrow, bluish-gray leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of purple and pink during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and requires full sun exposure. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
