    "intro": "Rubus cromerensis, commonly known as Cromer rose or Cromer blackberry, is a rare species of bramble native to the coastal areas of Norfolk, England. It is characterized by its dark purple to black berries, which are typically small and have a distinctive, slightly tart flavor. The plant has compound leaves with serrated edges and produces white flowers in early summer. It thrives in sandy, coastal soils and is often found growing in scrubland or on dunes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
