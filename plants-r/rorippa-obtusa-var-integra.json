    "intro": "Rorippa obtusa var. integra, commonly known as the broad-leaved watercress, is a aquatic or semi-aquatic flowering plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in shallow water, moist soil, or along the edges of ponds and streams. The plant has alternate, broadly ovate to heart-shaped leaves that are often floating or submerged. Its small, white flowers are arranged in racemes and bloom in early summer. It is valued for its peppery taste and is used in culinary applications, though it is also important in ecological restoration projects."
