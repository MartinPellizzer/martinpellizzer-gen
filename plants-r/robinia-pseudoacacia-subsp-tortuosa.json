    "intro": "Robinia pseudoacacia subsp. tortuosa, commonly known as the twisted false acacia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, zigzagging branches that give it a unique, twisted appearance. The plant produces fragrant, yellow, clustered flowers in the spring, which are followed by long, bean-like pods. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with oval to lance-shaped leaflets. This subspecies is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in open woodlands and along roadsides."
