    "intro": "Rapanea sandwicensis, commonly known as the Koa 'aha or the sandwicensis rapanea, is a rare endemic plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a small evergreen shrub or tree that typically grows in moist, shaded habitats on the windward slopes of Hawaii's islands. The plant has simple, ovate leaves with a glossy dark green surface and produces small, white or pale yellow flowers. Its fruit is a fleshy drupe that contains a single seed, and it plays a role in the local ecosystem by providing food for native birds and insects. Due to habitat loss and introduced species, it is considered endangered and is protected under conservation efforts."
