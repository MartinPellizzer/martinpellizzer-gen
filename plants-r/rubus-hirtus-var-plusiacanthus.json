It is characterized by its thorny stems and dark purple to black berries that ripen in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, woodland areas and thrives in partial shade. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the flowers are white with five petals. The fruit is edible, though the plant's thorns make harvesting challenging."
