    "intro": "Rubus thyrsoideus var. goniophylloides, commonly known as the purple-leaf bramble, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and compound leaves that are often purple-tinged, especially on the underside. The plant produces small, white to pink flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, raspberry-like fruits in the summer. Its stems are typically armed with thorns, and the leaves are trifoliate, with the central leaflet being larger than the lateral ones. This variety is often found in moist, wooded areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
