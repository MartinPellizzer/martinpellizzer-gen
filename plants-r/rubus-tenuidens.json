    "intro": "Rubus tenuidens, commonly known as the slender blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the western United States. It is characterized by its trailing or climbing growth habit, with thorny stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black when mature. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Botanically, it is closely related to other members of the Rubus genus, which includes many edible and ornamental brambles."
