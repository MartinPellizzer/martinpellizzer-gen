    "intro": "Roscheria, commonly known as the \"stonecrop\" or \"rock rose,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Crassulaceae. These succulent plants are native to arid and rocky regions, particularly in southern Africa. They are characterized by their fleshy, often blue-green leaves that store water, allowing them to thrive in dry conditions. Roscheria species typically produce small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple during the spring or summer. Due to their hardiness and ornamental value, they are popular choices for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
