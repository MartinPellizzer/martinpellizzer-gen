    "intro": "Ranunculus forreri var. madrensis, commonly known as the Madre\u00f1o buttercup, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of northern Mexico. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family, characterized by its showy, often yellow or white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are palmately divided, and the flowers consist of multiple sepals that resemble petals. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change."
