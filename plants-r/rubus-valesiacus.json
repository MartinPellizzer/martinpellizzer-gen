    "intro": "Rubus valesiacus, commonly known as the Valesiaca raspberry, is a species of bramble native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves, typical of the Rubus genus. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or black when ripe. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
