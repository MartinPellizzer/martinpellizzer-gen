    "intro": "Rubus absconditus, commonly known as the hidden raspberry, is a rare and elusive species of bramble native to the temperate regions of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and clusters of small, dark red berries that mature in late summer. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist woodland habitats, where it thrives in partial to full shade. Its flowers are white with five petals and are pollinated by insects, while its fruits are often consumed by birds and small mammals. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, Rubus absconditus is considered a species of conservation concern."
