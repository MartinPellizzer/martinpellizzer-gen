    "intro": "Rotala gerardii, commonly known as water lettuce, is a floating aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It has dark green, velvety leaves that are broad and heart-shaped, often with a waxy surface. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that bloom in clusters near the water's surface. It thrives in slow-moving or still freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Rotala gerardii is often used in aquariums and water gardens for its ornamental value and ability to help control algae growth."
