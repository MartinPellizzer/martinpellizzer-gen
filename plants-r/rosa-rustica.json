    "intro": "Rosa rustica, commonly known as the rough rose, is a perennial shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, fragrant pink or white flowers. The plant produces oval, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white down. Its fruit is a five-lobed rose hip, which contains the seeds. Rosa rustica is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported health benefits."
