    "intro": "Rhododendron henryi var. dunnii, commonly known as the Dunne's rhododendron, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to China. It features dense, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and glossy, providing a striking contrast to its showy flowers. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, pinkish-red blossoms that bloom in early spring, adding vibrant color to gardens. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is a popular choice for horticultural cultivation in temperate regions."
