    "intro": "Rhododendron willmottiae, commonly known as the Willmott's rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan Province in China. It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows at elevations between 2,000 and 3,500 meters, where it thrives in cool, moist, and shaded environments. Its botanical features include elongated, glandular hairs on the stems and leaves, which help protect it from herbivores and excessive sunlight. The flowers, which range in color from pink to red, are borne in clusters and are adapted for pollination by bees and other insects."
