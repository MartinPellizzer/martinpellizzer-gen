    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 erythrogynoides, commonly known as the blackberry raspberry or loganberry, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Rubus ursinus (blackberry) and Rubus idaeus (raspberry). It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces aggregate fruits composed of small, drupe-like berries that ripen to a deep red or black color. It thrives in temperate climates and prefers well-drained, loamy soils. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for both ornamental gardening and fruit cultivation."
