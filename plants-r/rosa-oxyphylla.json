    "intro": "Rosa oxyphylla, commonly known as the sharp-leaved rose, is a species of flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. The leaves are typically serrated and have a slightly hairy texture, contributing to its common name. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Rosa oxyphylla is valued both for its ornamental beauty and its historical use in traditional medicine."
