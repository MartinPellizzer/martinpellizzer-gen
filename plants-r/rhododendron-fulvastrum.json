    "intro": "Rhododendron fulvastrum, commonly known as the yellow-flowered rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of showy, yellow to orange-red flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. Its leaves are leathery and elliptical, with a glossy surface that helps retain moisture. Rhododendron fulvastrum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with the right conditions."
