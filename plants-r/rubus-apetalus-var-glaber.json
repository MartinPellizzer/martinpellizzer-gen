    "intro": "Rubus apetalus var. glaber, commonly known as the smooth blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant characterized by its smooth, hairless stems and leaves. It is native to the eastern United States and thrives in moist, fertile soils. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically smaller than those of other blackberry varieties. Its flowers are usually white and lack petals, which is why it is classified as apetalus. This variety is valued for its hardiness and is often cultivated for both its fruit and ornamental qualities."
