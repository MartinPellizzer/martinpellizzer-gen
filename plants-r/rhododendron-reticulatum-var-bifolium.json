    "intro": "Rhododendron reticulatum var. bifolium, commonly known as the twinleaf azalea, is a deciduous shrub native to the Appalachian Mountains of the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of showy, funnel-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The leaves are distinctive, featuring a unique bifoliate (two-leaf) structure at the base of each stem. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to naturalize in suitable climates."
