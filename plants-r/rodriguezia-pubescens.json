    "intro": "Rodriguezia pubescens, commonly known as the velvetleaf rodriguezia, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of soft, velvety hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in the spring. These flowers are followed by bright red, fleshy berries that contain several seeds. Rodriguezia pubescens is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to grow in humid, shaded environments."
