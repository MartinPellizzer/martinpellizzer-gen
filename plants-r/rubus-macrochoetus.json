    "intro": "Rubus macrochoetus, commonly known as the large-fruited blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the western United States. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces aggregate fruits composed of small, dark purple to black drupelets. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or riparian habitats. Due to its ornamental and edible qualities, it is occasionally cultivated for both landscape use and fruit production."
