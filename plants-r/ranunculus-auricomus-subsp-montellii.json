    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus subsp. montellii, commonly known as the Alpine buttercup, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features basal leaves that are deeply lobed and covered in fine hairs, with a striking yellow flower that has five to eight petal-like sepals. The plant thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils at high altitudes, often growing in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. It is characterized by its short stature and is often found in clusters, producing a showy display in the summer months. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some areas."
