    "intro": "Rosa tomentosa var. dumosa, commonly known as the woolly rose or the shrub rose, is a deciduous shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, grayish-white pubescence that covers its stems and leaves, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces fragrant, pink to reddish-pink flowers in late spring to early summer. Its foliage is typically dark green and leathery, and it is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal. Rosa tomentosa var. dumosa is well-suited to dry, sunny conditions and is relatively resistant to pests and diseases."
