It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, aggregate fruits that resemble raspberries. The plant produces edible berries that are often used in local cuisines and traditional medicine. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and partial shade. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical studies."
