    "intro": "Rhynchosia congestiflora, commonly known as the clustered cowpea, is a tropical legume native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers, which are followed by pod-like fruits containing edible seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along forest edges. Rhynchosia congestiflora is valued for its potential as a forage crop and its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
