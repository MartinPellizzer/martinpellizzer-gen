    "intro": "Rubus silesiacus var. glivicensis, commonly known as the Glivice\u0144 raspberry, is a variant of the brambles native to Central Europe. It is characterized by its erect growth habit and thorny stems, typical of the Rubus genus. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red when ripe, though they may vary in color depending on the specific variety. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil. This variety is often found in woodland edges and disturbed habitats, where it plays a role in local ecosystems."
