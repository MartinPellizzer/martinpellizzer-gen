    "intro": "Rhinephyllum obliquum, commonly known as the slant-leaf orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, elongated leaves that curve at an angle, giving it its common name. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with intricate patterns on the petals. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Rhinephyllum obliquum is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
