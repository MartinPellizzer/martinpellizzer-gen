    "intro": "Rosa znaimensis, commonly known as the Znaim rose, is a rare species native to the Carpathian Mountains in Romania. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, and its leaves are simple, alternate, and covered in fine hairs. Rosa znaimensis is adapted to moist, well-drained soils and thrives in partial to full shade. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
