It is characterized by its hairy, soft stems and leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red when ripe, though they may vary in color depending on the variety.

This variant is valued for its culinary uses and is also an important species in ecological studies due to its role in supporting local wildlife."
