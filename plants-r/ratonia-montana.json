    "intro": "Ratonia montana, commonly known as the mountain ratonia, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It features a slender, upright stem that can grow up to 60 centimeters in height, often covered in fine, hairy foliage. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly serrated edge, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Ratonia montana is adapted to cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats."
