    "intro": "Rhamnus alaternus f. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved buckthorn, is a shrub native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its dark green, elliptical leaves that are broader than those of the typical species. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by black, berry-like fruits that are an important food source for birds. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is occasionally used in ornamental landscaping."
