    "intro": "Rubus fagetanus, commonly known as the Faget's blackberry, is a species of brambles native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its thorny stems and aggregate fruits that develop from multiple small drupelets. The plant typically grows in moist, wooded areas and thrives in partial to full shade. Its leaves are compound, with three to five leaflets, and are often covered in fine hairs. The fruit, which ripens in late summer, is prized for its sweet, aromatic flavor and is used both in culinary applications and traditional medicine."
