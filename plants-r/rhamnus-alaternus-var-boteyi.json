    "intro": "Rhamnus alaternus var. boteyi, commonly known as the Spanish buckthorn, is a shrub native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its dense, thorny growth habit and small, dark green leaves that are oval in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by dark blue, waxy berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens despite its potential invasiveness."
