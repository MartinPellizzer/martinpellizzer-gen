    "intro": "Rhododendron henanense subsp. lingbaoense, commonly known as the Lingbao rhododendron, is a rare and endemic species native to China. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of pink to red. The plant typically grows in mountainous regions with acidic, well-drained soils. It prefers cool, humid climates and is often found in forested areas at moderate elevations. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical study and conservation efforts."
