    "intro": "Rubus disjunctiflorus, commonly known as the disjointed flower raspberry, is a species of bramble native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves with serrated edges and its clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant produces edible, red berries that are similar in appearance to other Rubus species but have a distinct flavor. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
