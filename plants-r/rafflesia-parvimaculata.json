    "intro": "Rafflesia parvimaculata, commonly known as the small-spotted rafflesia, is a parasitic flowering plant found in the rainforests of Indonesia. It is notable for producing one of the largest individual flowers in the world, which can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The plant lacks leaves, stems, and roots, relying entirely on its host, typically a species of Tetrastigma vine, for nutrients. Its flowers emit a strong, foul odor resembling decaying flesh, which attracts flies and other insects for pollination. The plant's unique biology and striking appearance make it a subject of both scientific interest and conservation concern."
