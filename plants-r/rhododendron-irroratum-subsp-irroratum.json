    "intro": "Rhododendron irroratum subsp. irroratum, commonly known as the silverleaf rhododendron, is a species native to the Himalayas, particularly in regions of India and Nepal. It is characterized by its silvery-white to pale green undersides on its leaves, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters. It produces showy clusters of pink to reddish flowers in the spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a landscape plant."
