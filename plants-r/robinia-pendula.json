    "intro": "Robinia pendula, commonly known as weeping honeylocust, is a deciduous legume native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its cascading, drooping branches that give it a distinctive, ornamental appearance. The plant produces small, green pods that contain flattened, seed-like structures called samaras. Its compound leaves are pinnately arranged with small, oval leaflets. Robinia pendula is valued for its adaptability to various soil types and its ability to fix nitrogen, making it a useful plant in ecological restoration projects."
