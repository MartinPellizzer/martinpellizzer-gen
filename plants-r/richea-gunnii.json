    "intro": "Richea gunnii, commonly known as the mountain heath, is a flowering plant native to Tasmania. It belongs to the family Ericaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, shrub-like structure. The plant features small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in spring. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a fine, woolly coating, which helps it retain moisture in its native environment. Richea gunnii is well adapted to the cool, moist conditions of Tasmania's high-altitude regions."
