It is characterized by its small, ovate leaves with a leathery texture and a dense covering of fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to reddish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal climates with mild winters and warm, dry summers. This subspecies is often found in coastal scrub and chaparral habitats, playing a role in local biodiversity."
