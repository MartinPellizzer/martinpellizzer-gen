    "intro": "Restio subcompressus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved restio, is a member of the Restionaceae family, native to southern Africa. It is a perennial grass-like plant characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and narrow, linear leaves. The plant typically grows in coastal and sandy environments, often forming dense stands. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are often hidden among the foliage, making it less showy than other restio species. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
