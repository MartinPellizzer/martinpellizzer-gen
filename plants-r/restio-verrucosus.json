    "intro": "Restio verrucosus, commonly known as the woolly restio, is a perennial grass-like plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and sandy soils, thriving in well-drained conditions. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a fine, velvety coating, giving it a distinctive appearance. Restio verrucosus is often used in ornamental gardening for its unique texture and ability to tolerate coastal environments."
