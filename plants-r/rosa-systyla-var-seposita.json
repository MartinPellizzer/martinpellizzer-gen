It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with dense foliage and clusters of fragrant, pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and full sun, making it well-suited for alpine gardens and rockeries. Its leaves are dark green, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are woody and often branched. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to harsh environmental conditions."
