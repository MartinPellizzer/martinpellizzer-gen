    "intro": "Rosa trachyphylla f. pinetorum, commonly known as the pine barbed rose, is a unique horticultural form of the shrub rose. It is characterized by its rough, barbed stems and dark green, serrated leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white, typically blooming in late spring. It is well-suited for coastal gardens due to its tolerance of salty air and well-drained soils. Its compact growth habit makes it an excellent choice for rock gardens or as a decorative hedge."
