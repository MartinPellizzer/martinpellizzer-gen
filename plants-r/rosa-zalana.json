    "intro": "Rosa zalana, commonly known as the Zalana rose, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white. The plant typically features finely cut, dark green foliage and thorny stems, typical of many rose species. Rosa zalana thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and somewhat obscure member of the Rosa genus."
