    "intro": "Rhodax frigidulus, commonly known as the Arctic bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the high Arctic regions. It is a perennial herb that thrives in cold, harsh environments, often found on tundra and rocky slopes. The plant produces bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple, which help attract pollinators in its short growing season. Its leaves are small, narrow, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs to reduce water loss. Rhodax frigidulus plays a vital role in the Arctic ecosystem, providing food for herbivores and contributing to the region's biodiversity."
