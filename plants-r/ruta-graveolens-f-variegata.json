    "intro": "Ruta graveolens f. variegata, commonly known as variegated rue, is a cultivar of the herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its aromatic, pinnately compound leaves that display striking variegation of green, white, and gold.

It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Due to its strong scent and potential toxicity, it should be handled with care."
