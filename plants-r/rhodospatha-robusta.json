    "intro": "Rhodospatha robusta, commonly known as the robust nightshade, is a member of the Solanaceae family, which includes plants like tomatoes and potatoes. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant has thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided in horticulture but studied for its ecological role."
