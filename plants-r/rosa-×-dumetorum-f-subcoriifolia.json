    "intro": "Rosa \u00d7 dumetorum f. subcoriifolia, commonly known as the alpine rose or creeping rose, is a compact, mat-forming shrub characterized by its dense, low-growing habit. It features small, oval to elliptical leaves that are covered with a fine, velvety pubescence, giving them a soft, coriaceous texture. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, pink to white flowers that bloom in early summer. It is native to the alpine regions of Europe and thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
