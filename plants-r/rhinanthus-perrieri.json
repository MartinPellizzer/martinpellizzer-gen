    "intro": "Rhinanthus perrieri, commonly known as the Perrier's yellow rattle, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, which includes hemiparasitic species that derive some of their nutrients from host plants. The plant produces bright yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in grassland habitats and is often found in areas with well-drained soils. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and declining species in many parts of its range."
