    "intro": "Rhamnus pentapomica, commonly known as the five-lobed buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically oval to elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by small, black berries that are a food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade. Rhamnus pentapomica is often found in hedgerows, woodland edges, and disturbed sites due to its adaptability and resilience."
