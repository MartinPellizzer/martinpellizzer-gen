    "intro": "Ranunculus acris, commonly known as the meadow buttercup, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers with five to nine petals and a hairy, upright stem. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and wetlands, thriving in moist, well-drained soils. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a distinctive hairy texture, and it produces small, greenish-yellow fruits that contain seeds. Ranunculus acris is often considered a weed in agricultural settings but is also valued for its ornamental beauty in gardens."
