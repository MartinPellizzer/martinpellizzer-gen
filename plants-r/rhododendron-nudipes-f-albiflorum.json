    "intro": "Rhododendron nudipes f. albiflorum, commonly known as the white-flowered form of the naked rhododendron, is a unique horticultural variant of the species Rhododendron nudipes. It is characterized by its striking white flowers, which contrast with the typical pink or red hues of the parent species. This form is typically found in the mountainous regions of southern China, where it thrives in cool, moist, and well-drained soils. The plant is evergreen, with leathery, elliptical leaves that provide dense foliage. It is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for its elegant, fragrant blooms."
