    "intro": "Ribes humile, commonly known as the dwarf gooseberry, is a deciduous shrub native to North America. It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters and is characterized by its small, yellowish-green leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by edible, tart berries in late summer. Its leaves are usually ovate to elliptical in shape with serrated edges. Ribes humile is often found in moist, woodland habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
