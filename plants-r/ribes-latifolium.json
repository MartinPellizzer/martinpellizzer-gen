    "intro": "Ribes latifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf currant, is a deciduous shrub native to western North America. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters and features opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are usually 5 to 10 centimeters long. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during early spring, which are followed by edible, red, currant-like berries. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, and the plant is known for its ornamental value and use in traditional herbal medicine. Ribes latifolium thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats."
