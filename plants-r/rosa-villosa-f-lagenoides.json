    "intro": "Rosa villosa f. lagenoides, commonly known as the woolly rose or the fuzzy rose, is a hybrid rose species characterized by its distinctive fuzzy, velvety foliage. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and is known for its fragrant, single or semi-double pink flowers. The plant typically grows as an upright shrub, reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters, with thorny stems and broad, ovate leaves covered in fine, white hairs. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for garden cultivation. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often used in landscaping and as a cut flower."
