    "intro": "Rhamnus pumila var. prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate buckthorn, is a low-growing shrub native to arctic and alpine regions of Eurasia. It features small, oval leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, giving them a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by dark blue berries that are edible for certain bird species. It thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and rocky habitats. Its compact growth habit and ability to withstand extreme cold make it a hardy plant adapted to harsh environmental conditions."
