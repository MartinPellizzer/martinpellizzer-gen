    "intro": "Rouliniella lignosa, commonly known as the blackwood or black thorn, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dark, woody stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces yellowish flowers followed by small, round fruits that contain a single seed. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland regions. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in horticulture for erosion control."
