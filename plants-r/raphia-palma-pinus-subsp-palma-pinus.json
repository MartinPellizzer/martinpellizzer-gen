    "intro": "Raphia palma-pinus subsp. palma-pinus, commonly known as the African fan palm, is a large, tropical palm native to Central and West Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces long, clustered inflorescences with both male and female flowers, facilitating wind pollination. Its robust root system helps stabilize soil, making it valuable in reforestation efforts. The fruit is a fibrous, spiky capsule that contains edible seeds, often used in local cuisines."
