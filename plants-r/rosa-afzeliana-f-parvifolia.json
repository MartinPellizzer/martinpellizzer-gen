It features small, oval leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white down, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its botanical characteristics make it well-suited for rock gardens and containers due to its compact growth habit. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various soil types."
