    "intro": "Restrepia cogniauxiana, commonly known as the Cogniaux's restia, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the high Andes of Peru. It is a small, terrestrial orchid with a delicate, creeping rhizome and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces pale yellow to greenish-yellow flowers with intricate, spurred petals, typical of the Epidendroideae subfamily. It thrives in cool, humid environments at high altitudes, often growing in rocky or alpine soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a critically endangered species."
