    "intro": "Racosperma rubricola, commonly known as the red-stemmed racosperma, is a member of the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod fruits. It is native to Australia and typically grows in dry, sandy soils, often in open woodlands or grasslands. The plant features slender, reddish stems and small, clustered flowers that range from white to pale pink in color. Its seed pods are elongated and contain several small, kidney-shaped seeds. Racosperma rubricola is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for native wildlife."
