    "intro": "Rosa \u00d7 dumetorum var. subtomentella, commonly known as the woolly dog\u73ab\u7470, is a compact, deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and small, dark green leaves that are covered in a fine, woolly pubescence. The flowers are typically pink or reddish-pink, with five petals and a fragrant scent, blooming in late spring to early summer. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in cooler climates."
