It produces small, dark purple to black berries that are edible and often used in traditional Chinese medicine. The plant has compound leaves with serrated edges and thorny stems, typical of the Rubus genus. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland areas or along streambanks. Its flowers are white or pale pink, appearing in early spring before the leaves fully emerge."
