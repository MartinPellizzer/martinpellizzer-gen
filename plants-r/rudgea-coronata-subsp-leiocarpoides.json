    "intro": "Rudgea coronata subsp. leiocarpoides, commonly known as the white-flowered rudgea, is a shrub native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, woody fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
