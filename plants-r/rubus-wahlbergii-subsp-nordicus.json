    "intro": "Rubus wahlbergii subsp. nordicus, commonly known as the Arctic bramble, is a shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of Europe and North America. It is characterized by its small, prickly stems and trifoliate leaves, which are adapted to cold climates. The plant produces white or pale pink flowers in early summer, followed by red, edible berries that are a food source for birds and small mammals. It thrives in rocky, acidic soils and is often found in tundra and alpine environments. Due to its hardy nature, it plays an important ecological role in its native habitats."
