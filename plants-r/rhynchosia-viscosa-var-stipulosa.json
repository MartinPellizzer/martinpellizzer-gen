    "intro": "Rhynchosia viscosa var. stipulosa, commonly known as the sticky leaf snout bean, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, viscid leaves that give it a sticky texture, and its distinctive yellow flowers with a prominent keel. The plant produces small, flat pods that contain several seeds, which are often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural studies."
