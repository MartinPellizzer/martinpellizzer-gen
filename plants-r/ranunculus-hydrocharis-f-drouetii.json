It features delicate, floating or submerged leaves that are typically divided into small, thread-like segments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers with five petals, often appearing in clusters at the water's surface. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes. Its botanical structure is adapted to aquatic life, with specialized leaves that aid in photosynthesis underwater."
