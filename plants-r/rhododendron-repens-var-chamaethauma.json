    "intro": "Rhododendron repens var. chamaethauma, commonly known as the creeping rhododendron or snowbell rhododendron, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of China. It features dense, leathery leaves that are dark green and often covered with a fine silvery bloom. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in late spring. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to form dense ground cover in woodland gardens."
