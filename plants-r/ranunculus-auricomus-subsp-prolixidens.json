    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus subsp. prolixidens, commonly known as the long-stemmed buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features distinctive bright yellow flowers with deeply lobed petals that resemble a crown, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has a short, stout stem that is often branched and covered with fine hairs. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant, showy blooms."
