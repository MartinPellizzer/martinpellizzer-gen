    "intro": "Rubus menkei var. tardiflorus, commonly known as the late-flowering blackberry shrub, is a variant of the Rubus genus native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that mature to a dark purple or black color. It typically blooms later in the growing season, hence its common name. This species is often found in moist, wooded areas and is valued for its ornamental and edible qualities."
