    "intro": "Reseda lutea var. vulgaris, commonly known as common reseda, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, yellow flowers and pinnately divided leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and waste grounds. It produces small, round seed pods that contain numerous tiny seeds, aiding in its spread. The plant is also known for its historical use in dyeing fabrics due to the presence of flavonoids in its flowers."
