    "intro": "Ruehssia umbellata, commonly known as the umbrella tree, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, umbrella-like clusters of small, white flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. The plant has dark green, glossy leaves that are arranged in a compact, bushy form. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Ruehssia umbellata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its attractive appearance and air-purifying properties."
