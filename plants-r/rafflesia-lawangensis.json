    "intro": "Rafflesia lawangensis, commonly known as the Lawangensis Rafflesia, is a parasitic flowering plant found in the rainforests of Indonesia. It is notable for producing one of the largest individual flowers in the world, which can reach up to 1 meter in diameter. The plant lacks leaves, stems, and roots, relying entirely on its host vine for nutrients. Its flowers emit a strong, unpleasant odor resembling rotting flesh, which attracts flies and other insects for pollination. The plant's unique biology and striking appearance make it a rare and fascinating subject in botanical study."
