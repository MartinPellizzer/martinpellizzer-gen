    "intro": "Ricinocarpus carpinifolius, commonly known as the horned mangrove, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its woody stems and dense, leathery leaves that are often covered in a whitish, powdery coating. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by distinctive, spiky fruits that contain toxic seeds. It thrives in saline and brackish water environments, making it an important species in mangrove ecosystems. Its ability to tolerate high salinity and periodic flooding contributes to its ecological significance in coastal areas."
