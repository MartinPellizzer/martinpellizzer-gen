    "intro": "Rourea strigulosa, commonly known as the velvetleaf rourea, is a species of flowering plant in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its soft, velvety leaves that give it its common name. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to elliptic in shape, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Rourea strigulosa produces small, inconspicuous flowers clustered in umbels, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds."
