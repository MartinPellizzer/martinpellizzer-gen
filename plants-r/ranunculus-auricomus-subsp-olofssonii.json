    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus subsp. olofssonii, commonly known as the Swedish buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to northern Europe. It features bright yellow, cup-shaped flowers with 5 to 15 petals, and its leaves are deeply lobed with a distinctive frayed appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in meadows and woodland edges. It has a short stem with a single flower at the top, and its botanical characteristics are closely related to other members of the Ranunculaceae family. The subspecies olofssonii is distinguished by its slightly smaller flowers and narrower leaves compared to the typical form of R. auricomus."
