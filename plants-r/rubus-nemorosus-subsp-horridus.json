    "intro": "Rubus nemorosus subsp. horridus, commonly known as the rough bramble, is a shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The flowers are typically white or pale pink, and the plant produces edible berries that are often used in jams and preserves. It thrives in woodland and hedgerow environments, preferring well-drained soils. This subspecies is notable for its hirsute (hairy) appearance, which gives it its common name."
