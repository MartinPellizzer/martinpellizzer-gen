    "intro": "Rhizophora macrorrhiza, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a salt-tolerant tree species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its distinctive aerial roots, known as pneumatophores, which help in gas exchange in waterlogged soils. The plant has thick, waxy leaves that reduce water loss and aid in photosynthesis in saline environments. Its flowers are small and clustered, and it produces woody fruits that contain buoyant seeds for dispersal. This species plays a crucial role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and providing habitats for various marine and terrestrial organisms."
