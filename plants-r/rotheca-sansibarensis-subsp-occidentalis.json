It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and small, daisy-like flowers. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid regions, often on rocky soils. It has a creeping or ascending growth habit and produces capsules as its fruiting structure. Due to its ecological adaptations, it plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for small organisms."
