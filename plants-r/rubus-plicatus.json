    "intro": "Rubus plicatus, commonly known as the prickly rose or bramble rose, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is a shrub that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. The plant is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, white or pink flowers. Its fruit, a red, aggregate berry, is edible but often covered in a fine layer of white, waxy powder. Rubus plicatus plays an important ecological role by providing food for various wildlife species."
