    "intro": "Rubus infestus var. missbachii, commonly known as the Missbach raspberry, is a variant of the bramble plant native to Europe. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and thorny stems, which help it to climb and spread across surfaces. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red when mature, containing multiple drupes. Its leaves are palmately compound, with five to seven leaflets that are serrated along the edges. This species is often found in disturbed soils and along woodland edges, where it thrives in partial shade to full sun."
