    "intro": "Rubus koehleri microgene pygmaeus, commonly known as the dwarf raspberry, is a small shrub belonging to the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its tiny, clustered flowers and small, edible berries that are typically red or yellow in color. The plant is native to certain regions of Southeast Asia, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the stems are covered in fine, soft hairs. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
