    "intro": "Ramium tenue, commonly known as slender bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features slender, prostrate stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a fuzzy texture. Ramium tenue is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks."
