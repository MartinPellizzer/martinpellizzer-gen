    "intro": "Rumex utahensis, commonly known as Utah sorrel, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its upright stems and alternate, palmately lobed leaves that are typically reddish or purple in color. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are greenish-white in hue, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Utah sorrel thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Its leaves are edible and have a tart, sour flavor, making it a traditional forage plant for both wildlife and humans."
