    "intro": "Ranunculus coniformis, commonly known as the narrowleaf crowfoot, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges. The plant features basal leaves that are divided into narrow, linear lobes, and it produces small, yellowish flowers with five petals. Its flowers are usually borne on slender stems and bloom from late spring to early summer. Ranunculus coniformis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
