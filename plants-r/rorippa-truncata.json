    "intro": "Rorippa truncata, commonly known as narrowleaf watercress, is a small, annual flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist or aquatic environments such as ponds, ditches, and stream margins. The plant has slender, branching stems and small, alternate leaves that are usually lance-shaped and have a slightly serrated edge. Its flowers are yellow and borne in clusters, and it produces small, round seeds that are dispersed by water. Rorippa truncata is often found in disturbed or wetland habitats and is considered a weed in some regions."
