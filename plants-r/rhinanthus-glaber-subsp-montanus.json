    "intro": "Rhinanthus glaber subsp. montanus, commonly known as the mountain common toadflax, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its subspecies status reflects adaptations to higher altitude environments compared to the more widespread R. glaber."
