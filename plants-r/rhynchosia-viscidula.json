    "intro": "Rhynchosia viscidula, commonly known as sticky cowpea, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and distinctive yellow flowers. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain edible seeds, similar to other legumes. Rhynchosia viscidula is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions. Its sticky surface, from which it gets its common name, helps in seed dispersal and provides a unique adaptation for survival."
