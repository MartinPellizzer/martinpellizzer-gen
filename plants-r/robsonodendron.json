    "intro": "Robsonodendron, commonly known as the African star jelly or star jelly plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Acanthaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its unique, star-shaped inflorescences that resemble jellyfish. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with opposite, lance-shaped leaves and showy, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. Robsonodendron species are often cultivated for their ornamental value due to their striking floral displays. They prefer well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making them suitable for tropical and subtropical gardens."
