    "intro": "Rechsteineria blassii, commonly known as the Blassii orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, intricate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pale pink. The plant prefers cool, humid environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the forest floor, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Rechsteineria blassii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
