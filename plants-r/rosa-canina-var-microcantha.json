    "intro": "Rosa canina var. microcantha, commonly known as the miniature dog rose, is a compact shrub native to southern Europe. It features small, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has thorny stems and dark green, lobed leaves that are slightly smaller than those of the common dog rose. It produces red-orange hips, which are edible and used in culinary and medicinal applications. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardy nature in gardens."
