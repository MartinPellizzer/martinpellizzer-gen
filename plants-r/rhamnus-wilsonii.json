    "intro": "Rhamnus wilsonii, commonly known as Wilson's buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of central and southern China. It typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters and features small, oval-shaped leaves with a glossy green upper surface and a lighter underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by dark blue berries that are an important food source for birds and small mammals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or rocky habitats. The species is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological importance in its native environment."
