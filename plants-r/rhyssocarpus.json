    "intro": "Rhyssocarpus, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. These plants are characterized by their striking, spiky, and often blue or purple-colored flowers that resemble sea stars, hence their common name. Rhyssocarpus species are typically found in coastal areas, where they thrive in sandy or saline soils. They have a rosette growth habit with thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The genus includes several species, such as Rhyssocarpus maritimus, which is native to the Mediterranean region."
