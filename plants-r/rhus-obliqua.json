    "intro": "Rhus obliqua, commonly known as the western poison oak, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It belongs to the Anacardiaceae family and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are often mistaken for edible plants. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by red, fuzzy berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including woodlands and disturbed soils, and is known for its ability to spread through vegetative means. Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided or removed in areas where human activity is frequent."
