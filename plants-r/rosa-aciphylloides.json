    "intro": "Rosa aciphylloides, commonly known as the aciphylloids rose, is a rare and unique species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. This plant is characterized by its unusual foliage, with leaves that are deeply lobed and resemble those of the genus Aciphyllopsis, hence its common name. It produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant is adapted to cold, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests or alpine meadows. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Rosa aciphylloides is considered a rare and endangered species."
