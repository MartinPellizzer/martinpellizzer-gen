    "intro": "Ranunculus \u00d7 scissus nothosubsp. disjunctus, commonly known as the hybrid meadow buttercup, is a botanical hybrid resulting from the cross between Ranunculus scissus and other Ranunculus species. It is characterized by its delicate, yellow flowers with a distinctive, divided center and trifoliate leaves. This plant typically grows in moist, grassy habitats such as meadows and stream banks. It is native to parts of Europe and has been introduced to other regions, including North America. Its botanical interest lies in its hybrid origin and its role in ecological studies of plant hybridization."
