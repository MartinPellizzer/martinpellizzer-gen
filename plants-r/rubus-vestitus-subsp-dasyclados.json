    "intro": "Rubus vestitus subsp. dasyclados, commonly known as the hairy blackberry, is a shrub native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its slender, thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The subspecies is distinguished by its dense, woolly pubescence, which covers much of its foliage and stems."
