    "intro": "Reseda nogalensis, commonly known as the Mexican catchfly, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows in dry, rocky habitats. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a reddish or purple tint. Its leaves are linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Reseda nogalensis is part of the Caryophyllaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants adapted to dry climates."
