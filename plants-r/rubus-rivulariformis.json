    "intro": "Rubus rivulariformis, commonly known as the riverbank raspberry. It is a shrub native to temperate regions of Asia and North America, characterized by its trailing growth habit and thorny stems. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or yellow in color, similar to other Rubus species. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments along riverbanks and stream sides. It plays an important ecological role by providing food for wildlife and stabilizing soil in riparian zones."
