    "intro": "Ribes crispum, commonly known as the creeping gooseberry, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features upright, arching stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense ground cover. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by red, edible berries in late summer. Its leaves are oval with serrated edges and a slightly hairy texture. Ribes crispum thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas or along streambanks."
