It is characterized by its unique, showy flowers that resemble the eyes of a panther, hence its common name. The plant features a slender, erect stem with several whorls of narrow, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are typically pale yellow with dark brown or black markings, creating a striking visual contrast. Robiquetia pantherina thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas."
