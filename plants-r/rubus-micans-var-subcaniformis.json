    "intro": "Rubus micans var. subcaniformis, commonly known as the silverleaf blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to certain regions of North America. It is characterized by its distinctive silvery-white undersides on its leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, dark red to black berries that are typically edible but often have a tart flavor. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodlands or along streambanks. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both horticultural study and ecological research."
