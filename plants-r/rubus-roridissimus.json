    "intro": "Rubus roridissimus, commonly known as the coastal evergreen blackberry, is a shrub native to the western coast of North America. It is characterized by its dense, thorny growth and dark green, leathery leaves that are often covered in fine white hairs. The plant produces small, edible berries that are typically black when ripe, though they are not as widely consumed as other blackberry species. It thrives in coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils. Rubus roridissimus plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing food and habitat for various wildlife species."
