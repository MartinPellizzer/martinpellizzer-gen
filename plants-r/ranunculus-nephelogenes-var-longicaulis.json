    "intro": "Ranunculus nephelogenes var. longicaulis, commonly known as the long-stemmed cloud flower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, often with a contrasting central blotch. The plant features a slender, branched stem that can grow up to 60 cm in height, with trifoliate leaves that are finely divided. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. The variety *longicaulis* is distinguished by its longer, more elongated stems compared to the typical form of *R. nephelogenes*."
