    "intro": "Raphidophyllum, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Melanthiaceae and is characterized by its striking, lantern-like inflorescence that resembles a ghostly face. The plant is notable for its unique morphology, featuring a tall, slender stem with large, showy white bracts that bloom at night. Raphidophyllum is often found in shaded, humid environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in partial shade. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered an endangered species in its native range."
