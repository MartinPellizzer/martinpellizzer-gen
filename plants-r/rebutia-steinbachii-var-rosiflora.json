    "intro": "Rebutia steinbachii var. rosiflora, commonly known as the Rosy Rebutia, is a compact, low-growing cactus native to South America. It features rounded, ribbed stems that are typically green or bluish-green in color. The plant produces showy, pink to magenta flowers during the spring and summer months. Its foliage is often covered in fine, white to silver hairs, which help reduce water loss. It is well-suited for rock gardens and requires well-draining soil and full sun to thrive."
