    "intro": "Rosa viscaria var. sublaevipes, commonly known as the hairy rose or the bristly rose, is a shrub-like plant native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or red. The leaves are compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets with a hairy texture, which gives the plant its common name. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often found in rocky or alpine environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and attractive blooms."
