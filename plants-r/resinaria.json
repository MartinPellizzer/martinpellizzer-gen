    "intro": "Resinaria, commonly known as the resin tree, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Myrtaceae. It is characterized by its aromatic leaves and the production of a valuable resin, which has been used historically for medicinal and industrial purposes. The plant typically features small, white or pink flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its woody structure and evergreen foliage make it well adapted to tropical and subtropical climates. Resinaria species are often found in regions with high humidity and well-drained soils, contributing to their ecological significance in forest ecosystems."
