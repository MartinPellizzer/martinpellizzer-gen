    "intro": "Rubus nemophilus, commonly known as the forest raspberry, is a species of bramble native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and produces small, edible berries that are often used in local cuisines. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and undergrowth, where it forms dense mats. Its leaves are typically compound, with five to seven leaflets, and its flowers are white or pale pink, appearing in clusters. The plant plays an important ecological role by providing food for various wildlife species and contributing to soil stabilization in forest ecosystems."
