    "intro": "Rebulobivia haagei, commonly known as the Cape goldcup, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and prefers full sun exposure. Its foliage is often covered in a fine, white powdery coating, which helps to reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. Rebulobivia haagei is a low-maintenance plant that is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
