It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features bright yellow flowers with five petals, and its leaves are palmately lobed with a distinctive waxy coating. It produces small, greenish-yellow fruits that contain multiple seeds. Ranunculus colocensis is known for its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes, making it an invasive species in some regions."
