    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus subsp. mimulus, commonly known as the golden ragwort, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its bright yellow, cup-shaped flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. The subspecies mimulus is distinguished by its slightly larger flowers and more robust growth compared to the typical form of Ranunculus auricomus."
