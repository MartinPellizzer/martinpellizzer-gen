    "intro": "Rumex alpinus var. subcalliger, commonly known as the alpine sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It features upright, hairy stems that bear alternate, lance-shaped leaves with a reddish or purple tinge on the underside. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its leaves are edible and have a tangy, sour flavor due to the presence of oxalic acid. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in mountainous environments."
