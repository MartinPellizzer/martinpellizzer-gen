    "intro": "Restrepia lonchophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leafed restrepia, is a species of orchid native to the Andean regions of South America. It is a small, epiphytic plant that typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, high-altitude environments. The plant features long, narrow leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. Its flowers are usually pale green or yellow, with a distinctive, elongated lip that is characteristic of the Restrepia genus. This orchid prefers cool, shaded conditions and is often found in cloud forests where it can receive indirect light and consistent moisture."
