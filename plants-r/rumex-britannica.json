    "intro": "Rumex britannica, commonly known as British sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive reddish coloration on the veins, which are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming in spring. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense patches in moist, fertile soils. The leaves are edible, though they contain oxalic acid and should be consumed in moderation."
