    "intro": "Rubus nemorosus subsp. dumetorum, commonly known as the bracken raspberry, is a shrub native to temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in woodlands, hedgerows, and damp meadows, often forming dense thickets. The plant produces prickly stems and clusters of small, pale yellow flowers in spring. Its fruit, a red, hairy berry, ripens in late summer and is edible but often described as tart. This subspecies is characterized by its robust growth habit and adaptability to shaded environments."
