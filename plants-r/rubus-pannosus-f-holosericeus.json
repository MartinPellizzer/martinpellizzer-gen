    "intro": "Rubus pannosus f. holosericeus, commonly known as the silky bramble, is a variant of the common bramble, characterized by its dense, silken-soft pubescence on both stems and leaves. It is a deciduous shrub native to parts of Asia, particularly China, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The leaves are trifoliate, with each leaflet having a serrated margin and a slightly hairy surface. Its flowers are small, white to pale pink, and appear in clusters, followed by red, aggregate fruits that are edible but often tart. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and seasonal interest."
