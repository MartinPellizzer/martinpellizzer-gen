    "intro": "Rubus questieri f. tomentosus, commonly known as the woolly blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to certain regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, white-tomentose (woolly) covering on the stems and leaves, which provides a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically edible. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges or disturbed soils. Its botanical features make it a notable species within the Rubus genus."
