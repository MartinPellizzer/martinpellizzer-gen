    "intro": "Ranunculus castellanus var. macrocarpus, commonly known as the large-fruited water crowfoot, is a aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It thrives in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds, ditches, and wet meadows. The plant has finely divided, floating leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to prevent water loss. Its flowers are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, with five petals and numerous stamens, blooming from late spring to early autumn. The plant plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and amphibians."
