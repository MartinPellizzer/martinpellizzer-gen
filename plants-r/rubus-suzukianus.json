    "intro": "Rubus suzukianus, commonly known as the Japanese blackberry, is a species of bramble native to Japan. It is characterized by its thorny stems, trifoliate leaves, and dark red to black berries that ripen in late summer. The plant belongs to the Rosaceae family and is closely related to other Rubus species found in temperate regions. Its flowers are typically white or pink, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in areas outside its native range."
