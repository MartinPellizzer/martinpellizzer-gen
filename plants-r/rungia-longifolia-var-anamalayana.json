    "intro": "Rungia longifolia var. anamalayana, commonly known as the Anamalayan rungea, is a flowering plant native to the Western Ghats of India. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring lance-shaped leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that dehisces to release seeds, contributing to its propagation in the wild. This variety is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its aesthetic appeal in gardens."
