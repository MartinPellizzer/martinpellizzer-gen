It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow floral spikes. The plant is adapted to dry conditions, with deep roots that allow it to survive in nutrient-poor soils. Its flowers are often visited by native bees and birds, contributing to local biodiversity."
