    "intro": "Rubus callayi, commonly known as the Andean blackberry, is a species of shrub native to South America, particularly in the Andean regions of Peru and Bolivia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, dark red to black berries. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or mountainous areas with cool, temperate climates. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have serrated edges, while its flowers are white or pale pink. The fruit is edible, though it is generally less commercially cultivated compared to other Rubus species."
