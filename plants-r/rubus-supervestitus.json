    "intro": "Rubus supervestitus, commonly known as the naked raspberry, is a species of brambles native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its smooth, hairless stems and leaves, which distinguish it from many other Rubus species. The plant produces small, aggregated fruits that are typically red or yellow in color. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within the Rubus genus."
