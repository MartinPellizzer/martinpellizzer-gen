    "intro": "Rubus carpinifolius subsp. platybelus, commonly known as the flat-leaf bramble, is a shrub native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are broad and have a distinctive flat appearance. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits known as drupes, typically red or black in color. It thrives in moist, wooded areas and is often found in hedgerows or along streambanks. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
