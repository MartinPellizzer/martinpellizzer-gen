    "intro": "Rhinanthus major subsp. apterus, commonly known as the common yellow rattle, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, characterized by its hemiparasitic nature, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, often in grassland habitats. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, aiding in nutrient uptake. The species is notable for its role in promoting biodiversity by reducing competitive pressure on grasses."
