    "intro": "Rhynchospora borinquensis, commonly known as the Boriqu\u00e9n sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Caribbean island of Puerto Rico. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and related grass-like plants. This species is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in late spring to early summer. Rhynchospora borinquensis is often found in wetland habitats such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species, highlighting its ecological significance in Puerto Rican ecosystems."
