It produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or yellow, similar to other Rubus species. The plant is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the stems are often covered in glandular hairs. This form is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its edible fruits."
