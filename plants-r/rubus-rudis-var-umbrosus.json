    "intro": "Rubus rudis var. umbrosus, commonly known as the shady raspberry. This variant of the raspberry plant is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves and smaller, more clustered flowers compared to the typical raspberry. It thrives in shaded environments, making it well-suited for woodland or shaded garden settings. The plant produces small, tart berries that are often less sweet than those of other raspberry varieties. Botanically, it is distinguished by its unique growth habits and morphological adaptations to low-light conditions."
