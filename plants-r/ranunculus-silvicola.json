    "intro": "Ranunculus silvicola, commonly known as the woodland buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and along stream banks, where it thrives in nutrient-rich, well-drained soils. The plant features delicate, palmately divided leaves and produces showy, yellow flowers with five petals, often surrounded by five sepals. Its flowers bloom in early spring, and it is known for its ability to spread through rhizomes, forming dense colonies in suitable habitats. Ranunculus silvicola is also noted for its preference for cool, humid conditions and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
