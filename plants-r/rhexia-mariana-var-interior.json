    "intro": "Rhexia mariana var. interior, commonly known as the interior marsh pink, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. The plant features showy pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and often covered in fine hairs. This variety is distinguished by its more restricted geographic range compared to other Rhexia species."
