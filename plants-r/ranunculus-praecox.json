    "intro": "Ranunculus praecox, commonly known as the early buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to temperate regions of Europe and western Asia. It features striking, bright yellow flowers with prominent, petal-like sepals and a central cluster of stamens. The plant typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm, with trifoliate leaves that are deeply lobed and hairy. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. The early buttercup blooms in spring, making it one of the first flowering plants to appear in many habitats."
