    "intro": "Ranunculus hydrocharoides var. stolonifer, commonly known as the stoloniferous water crowfoot, is a perennial aquatic plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in shallow freshwater habitats such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. The plant features finely divided, floating or submerged leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers with five petals. Its stoloniferous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively through runners, forming dense mats on the water surface. This species plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
