    "intro": "Rhinanthus minor var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf yellowtop, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, commonly known as the broomrape family, and is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its narrow, linear leaves and showy inflorescences make it distinctive within its ecological community."
