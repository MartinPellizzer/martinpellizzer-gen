    "intro": "Ranunculus repens var. villosiusculus, commonly known as the hairy sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and showy yellow flowers. It thrives in moist, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal areas or along riverbanks. The plant has a creeping habit, with stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Its flowers typically bloom in early spring, and the plant is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions. It is considered a valuable species for stabilizing sandy soils and supporting local biodiversity."
