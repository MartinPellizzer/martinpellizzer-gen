It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and requires partial to full shade for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
