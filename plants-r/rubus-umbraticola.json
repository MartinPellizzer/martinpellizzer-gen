    "intro": "Rubus umbraticola, commonly known as the shadow raspberry, is a rare shrub native to the dense, shaded forests of the Pacific Northwest. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves and clusters of small, edible berries. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and requires partial to full shade for optimal growth. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, and they bloom in early spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Rubus umbraticola is considered a sensitive indicator species for undisturbed forest ecosystems."
