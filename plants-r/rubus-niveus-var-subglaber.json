It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and dark green, leathery leaves that remain evergreen throughout the year. The plant produces small, black berries that are typically harvested in the fall. Its flowers are white and clustered in umbels, and the plant thrives in moist, acidic soils. It is often found in woodlands and along stream banks, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife."
