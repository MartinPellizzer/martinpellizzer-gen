    "intro": "Rhus cotinoides, commonly known as smoke bush, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound, pinnately arranged leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in panicles, which are followed by distinctive, fluffy, pale pink to reddish seed heads that resemble smoke. Its bark is smooth and grayish, with a rough texture that becomes fissured with age. Rhus cotinoides is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes."
