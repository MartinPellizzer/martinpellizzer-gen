    "intro": "Rubus grayanus f. chaetophotus, commonly known as the hairy-fruited blackberry, is a botanical variant of the Rubus genus. It is characterized by its distinctive hairy texture on the fruit surface, which sets it apart from other blackberry species. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically clustered together. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. This subspecies is valued for both its ornamental appeal and its edible fruits."
