    "intro": "Rubus horridus var. fuscoater, commonly known as the blackberry bramble, is a thorny shrub native to the western United States. It produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically harvested in late summer. The plant has compound leaves with serrated edges and is characterized by its dense, prickly growth habit. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or disturbed areas. The berries are edible but can be quite tart, making them suitable for cooking or making jams."
