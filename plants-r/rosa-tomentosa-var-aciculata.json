    "intro": "Rosa tomentosa var. aciculata, commonly known as the prickly rose, is a variant of the woolly rose native to regions of Asia and the Middle East. It is characterized by its dense, grayish-white pubescence covering the stems and leaves, giving it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink to white, typically blooming in the spring. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets with a serrated edge. This shrub is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
