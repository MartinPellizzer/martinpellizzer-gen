    "intro": "Rosa stebleri var. subtomentella, commonly known as the woolly rose, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, grayish-white pubescent foliage and stems, which give it a distinctive, woolly appearance. The plant produces fragrant, pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are simple, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its overall textured appearance. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens for its visual appeal and hardiness."
