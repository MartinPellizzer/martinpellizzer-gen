    "intro": "Ruppia occidentalis, commonly known as western pondweed, is a submerged aquatic plant native to North America. It has long, ribbon-like leaves that are typically bright green and can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. This plant thrives in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. Its flowers are small and yellow, often floating on the water surface, and it produces small, spherical fruits that disperse via water. Ruppia occidentalis plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
