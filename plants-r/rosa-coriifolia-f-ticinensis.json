    "intro": "Rosa coriifolia f. ticinensis, commonly known as the Ticinese shrub rose, is a compact, deciduous shrub native to the Alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in early spring. The foliage consists of dark green, serrated leaves that provide a lush backdrop to the pink or white blooms. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in cooler climates. It is often used in gardens for its aesthetic value and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
