    "intro": "Ranunculus cymbalaria f. multisectus, commonly known as the multi-lobed water crowfoot, is a variant of the water crowfoot genus characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. It is typically found in wetlands, stream margins, and other aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers with five petals, which bloom in early spring. Its leaves are often deeply lobed or dissected, giving it a delicate, lace-like appearance. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological role in supporting aquatic ecosystems."
