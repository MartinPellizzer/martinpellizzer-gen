    "intro": "Rubus krasanii, commonly known as the Krasan blackberry, is a species of brambles native to the Caucasus region. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black in color. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges and rocky areas. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species within its native range."
