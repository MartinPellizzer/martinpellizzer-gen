    "intro": "Rhaponticum scariosum subsp. bicknellii, commonly known as Bicknell's thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its large, hairy, and often purple-tinged leaves that are deeply lobed and covered in fine, bristly hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in a terminal head, which are surrounded by a series of overlapping, spiny bracts. It thrives in dry, rocky, and alpine environments, often growing at high elevations. This subspecies is notable for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its resilience to harsh environmental conditions."
