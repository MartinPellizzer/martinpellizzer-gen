    "intro": "Rapuntium caeruleum, commonly known as the blue ragwort, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of blue-green, hairy leaves and yellow-orange flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and waste areas, and can thrive in a variety of soil types. It is considered a short-lived perennial, typically growing to a height of about 30 centimeters. Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided by livestock and can be a weed in agricultural settings."
