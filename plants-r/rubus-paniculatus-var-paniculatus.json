    "intro": "Rubus paniculatus var. paniculatus, commonly known as the red raspberry, is a deciduous shrub native to North America. It is characterized by its biennial growth habit, with flowering occurring on the previous year's growth. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to red flowers that develop into the familiar red, hairy berries. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the stems are covered in stiff, thorny prickles. This species is often cultivated for its edible fruits and is also valued in ecological restoration projects."
