    "intro": "Rosa dumalis var. acharii, commonly known as the Armenian rose, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and parts of Turkey. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and clusters of fragrant, pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or forested areas and is well adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, reddish-orange hips that contain the seeds. This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been cultivated for both its beauty and historical significance in traditional medicine."
