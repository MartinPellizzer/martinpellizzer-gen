    "intro": "Rosa rugosa var. alba, commonly known as white rugosa rose, is a deciduous shrub native to coastal regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems, broad ovate leaves, and clusters of fragrant white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is highly adaptable, thriving in sandy or salty soils and tolerating harsh coastal conditions. Its ornamental value comes from its showy blooms and rugged, hardy nature. It is also valued for its use in landscaping and as a source of rose hips."
