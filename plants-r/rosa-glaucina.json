    "intro": "Rosa glaucina, commonly known as the blue rose, is a species of flowering plant native to the Himalayas. It is characterized by its pale blue or lavender-colored petals, which are unique among roses due to the presence of a pigment called delphinidin. The plant typically grows in alpine regions and has a compact, bushy habit with thorny stems. Its flowers bloom in late summer and are known for their delicate fragrance. Rosa glaucina is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens for its striking appearance."
