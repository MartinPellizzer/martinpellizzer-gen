It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that ripen to a dark purple or black color. It thrives in moist, woodland habitats and is often found in the understory of deciduous forests. The serrated blackberry is valued for its edible berries and its role in supporting local wildlife."
