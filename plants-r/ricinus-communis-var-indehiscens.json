    "intro": "Ricinus communis var. indehiscens, commonly known as the non-shedding castor plant, is a variant of the castor oil plant characterized by its inability to shed its seed casings. This variety is notable for its ornamental value, featuring large, palmate leaves with a velvety texture. The plant produces striking red or orange spiny seed capsules that remain attached to the plant throughout the growing season. It is typically grown as a decorative plant in warm climates due to its preference for tropical conditions. While it shares the same genus as the oil-producing castor plant, var. indehiscens is primarily cultivated for its aesthetic appeal rather than its economic uses."
