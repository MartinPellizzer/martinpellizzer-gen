    "intro": "Rosa globularis var. acutifolia, commonly known as the sharp-leaved globular rose, is a compact, shrub-like plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, globe-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in early summer. The leaves are narrow and pointed, giving the plant its common name, and they are arranged in a dense, bushy pattern. This variety is well-suited for rock gardens or containers due to its compact growth habit. It requires well-drained soil and full sun to thrive, making it a popular choice for drought-tolerant landscaping."
