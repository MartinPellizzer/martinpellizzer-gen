    "intro": "Rubus subpauperatus, commonly known as the poorflower raspberry, is a species of bramble native to parts of eastern North America. It is a shrub that typically grows in moist, wooded areas and is characterized by its small, pale pink to white flowers. The plant has compound leaves with three to five leaflets and produces small, red berries that are edible but not as widely cultivated as other raspberry species. It is relatively rare and has limited distribution, making it of interest to botanists and conservationists. The plant's botanical features make it distinct within the Rubus genus, with unique floral and fruit characteristics."
