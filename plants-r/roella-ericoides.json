    "intro": "Roella ericoides, commonly known as the heath rose or swamp rose, is a flowering plant native to the wetlands of southeastern Australia. It is a shrub that typically grows in swampy or waterlogged soils, often in heathland or coastal areas. The plant features small, pink or white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to the moist, nutrient-poor environments it inhabits. Roella ericoides plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for native wildlife."
