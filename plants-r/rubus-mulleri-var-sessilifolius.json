    "intro": "Rubus mulleri var. sessilifolius, commonly known as the sessile-leaf blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to certain regions of China. It is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit, with thorny stems and dark green, sessile (nearly leafless) leaves. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black in color. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland or scrubland habitats. Due to its ornamental and edible qualities, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and for local use."
