    "intro": "Ruschia alborubra, commonly known as the red-stemmed Ruschia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features fleshy, cylindrical stems that are typically red or purple in color, which help it store water in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to white, often blooming in spring. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a slight waxy coating to reduce water loss. Ruschia alborubra thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
