    "intro": "Rhododendron \u00d7 sarcodes, commonly known as the purpleleaf rhododendron, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Rhododendron catawbiense and Rhododendron maximum. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage that exhibits a distinctive purple or reddish hue on the underside. The plant produces showy, clustered flowers that range in color from pink to deep red, typically blooming in late spring. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular ornamental species in woodland gardens. Its botanical features make it both visually striking and ecologically valuable in native habitats."
