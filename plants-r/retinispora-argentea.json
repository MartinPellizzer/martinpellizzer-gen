    "intro": "Retinispora argentea, commonly known as silverleaf retinispora, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which gives it its common name, and its small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has a smooth, pale bark and produces small, edible fruits that are sometimes used in traditional medicine. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. Retinispora argentea is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been introduced to other tropical regions for horticultural purposes."
