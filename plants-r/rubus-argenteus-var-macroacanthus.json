    "intro": "Rubus argenteus var. macroacanthus, commonly known as the silverleaf bramble, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its silvery-white undersides on its leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, aggregated fruits known as drupes, which are typically red or orange in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has some historical use in traditional medicine."
