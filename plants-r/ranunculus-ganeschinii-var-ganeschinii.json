    "intro": "Ranunculus ganeschinii var. ganeschinii, commonly known as the Ganeschin's buttercup, is a rare and endemic species native to the high-altitude regions of the Eastern Himalayas. It is a herbaceous plant with delicate, palmate leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Its flowers have five to seven sepals that are often mistaken for petals, and it produces small, hairy seeds in a follicle. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
