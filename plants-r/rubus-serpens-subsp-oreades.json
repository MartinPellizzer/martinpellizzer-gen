    "intro": "Rubus serpens subsp. oreades, commonly known as the alpine blackberry, is a shrub native to mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, dark red berries that are typically edible but often have a tart flavor. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cool, high-altitude environments. Due to its hardiness, it is often found in alpine meadows and forested slopes."
