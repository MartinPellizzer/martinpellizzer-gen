    "intro": "Reseda macrostachya, commonly known as yellow rattle, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the family Brassicaceae, characterized by its small, four-petaled flowers. The plant produces slender, branching stems that bear clusters of yellow flowers from late spring to early summer. Its seeds are encased in a hard, dry capsule, and the plant is known for its ability to self-seed readily. Yellow rattle is often found in grassy habitats and is valued for its ecological role in promoting biodiversity."
