    "intro": "Rubus schmidelyanus var. capricollensis, commonly known as the alpine blackberry, is a shrub native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, dark red berries that are typically consumed by birds and other wildlife. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, mountainous climates. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
