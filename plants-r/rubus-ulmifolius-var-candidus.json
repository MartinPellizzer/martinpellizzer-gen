    "intro": "Rubus ulmifolius var. candidus, commonly known as the white-berried bramble, is a variant of the common bramble, characterized by its pale or white fruits. It is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia, typically found in woodland edges and rocky soils. The plant has compound leaves with serrated edges and produces small, fragrant flowers in the spring. Its fruit, while not as commonly consumed as other raspberries, is used in local cuisines and traditional medicine. The white-berried bramble is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
