    "intro": "Rumex \u00d7 finitimus, commonly known as the hybrid sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant that exhibits characteristics of both its parent species, Rumex acetosa and Rumex acetobipinus. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides, where it thrives in partial to full shade. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive reddish or purple underside, and it produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring. Its rhubarb-like leaves are edible but contain oxalic acid, so they should be cooked before consumption. The hybrid is often found in the wild in regions of Europe and parts of Asia."
