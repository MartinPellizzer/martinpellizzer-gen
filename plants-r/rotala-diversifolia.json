    "intro": "Rotala diversifolia, commonly known as the spiked waterwheel plant, is a submerged aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It features whorled leaves that are typically bright green and have a waxy texture, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or white, followed by distinctive, spiky fruits. It thrives in slow-moving to still freshwater environments and is often used in aquariums for its ornamental value. Rotala diversifolia plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen for aquatic life."
