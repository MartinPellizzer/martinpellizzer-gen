    "intro": "Ranunculus fallax subsp. blandus, commonly known as the western water buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to western North America. It is characterized by its delicate, nodding yellow flowers and trifoliate leaves, which are typically lobed and hairy. The plant thrives in moist, often aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats such as marshes, wet meadows, and along stream banks. It has a short, stout rhizome and produces small, greenish-brown seeds in a cup-like structure. Its botanical features make it well adapted to wetland environments, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
