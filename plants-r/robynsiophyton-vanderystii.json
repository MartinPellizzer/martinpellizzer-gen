    "intro": "Robynsiophyton vanderystii, commonly known as the Vanderyst's ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the rainforests of Madagascar. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance with pale greenish-white flowers. The plant exhibits a sympodial growth habit, with short, creeping rhizomes and a few erect stems. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, with three sepals and three petals, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered critically endangered."
