    "intro": "Rohdea dracaenoides, commonly known as the dragon tree or rohdea, is a tropical evergreen plant native to Southeast Asia. It features a short, thick trunk and broad, strap-like leaves that are usually dark green with a reddish or bronze tint on the underside. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by red berries, which are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil and partial shade. Rohdea dracaenoides is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to indoor conditions."
