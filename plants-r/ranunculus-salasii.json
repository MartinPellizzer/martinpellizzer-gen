    "intro": "Ranunculus salasii, commonly known as the Salasii buttercup, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It is characterized by its delicate, cup-shaped flowers that typically range in color from yellow to orange, with a distinctive central stigma. The plant has palmately divided leaves that are finely toothed, and it thrives in cool, moist environments. It is a perennial herb that prefers well-drained soils and partial to full sun exposure. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
