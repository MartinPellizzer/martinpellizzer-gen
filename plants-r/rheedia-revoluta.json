    "intro": "Rheedia revoluta, commonly known as the red-veined rainforest plant, is a species native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is a flowering plant belonging to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenia. The plant is characterized by its striking, velvety leaves with deep red veins, which give it its common name. Rheedia revoluta typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in the canopy layers of humid forests. It produces small, clustered white flowers that are often overlooked but play a role in its ecological interactions."
