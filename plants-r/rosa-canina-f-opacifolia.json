    "intro": "Rosa canina f. opacifolia, commonly known as the opacifolia rose, is a botanical variant of the dog rose. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves that are more densely pubescent than those of the typical Rosa canina. The flowers are usually pale yellow with a slight red tinge, and they bloom in early summer. This form is often found in woodland edges and hedgerows, where it thrives in partial shade. Its foliage and floral structure make it a distinctive and ornamental variant within the rose family."
