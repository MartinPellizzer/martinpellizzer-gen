    "intro": "Restio oligocephalus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved restio, is a member of the Restionaceae family, native to southern Africa. It is a perennial herb characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in coastal or mountainous regions. Due to its delicate structure and specific habitat requirements, it is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments."
