    "intro": "Rosa lexnitzensis, commonly known as the Lexnitz rose, is a rare and endangered species native to the Carpathian Mountains. It is a shrub with thorny stems and dark green, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces fragrant, semi-double pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and requires a cool, temperate climate. Due to habitat loss, it is critically endangered and is protected in several conservation programs."
