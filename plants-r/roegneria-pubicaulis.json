    "intro": "Roegneria pubicaulis, commonly known as the hairy wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, hairy leaf blades that give it its common name. The plant produces spikelets that are typically clustered in panicle-like inflorescences, with each spikelet containing two to three florets. Roegneria pubicaulis is adapted to harsh, alpine environments and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils. Its botanical features make it a valuable species for ecological studies and potential use in restoration projects."
