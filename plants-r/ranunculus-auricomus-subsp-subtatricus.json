    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus subsp. subtatricus, commonly known as the alpine buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Central and Eastern Europe. It typically grows in rocky or grassy slopes at high altitudes, where it thrives in well-drained soils. The plant features delicate, bright yellow flowers with five broadly ovate petals, often surrounded by a series of small, leaf-like sepals. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a hairy surface that helps reduce water loss in harsh mountain environments. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic alpine conditions."
