    "intro": "Racosperma excentricum, commonly known as the narrow-leafed wattled grevillea, is a flowering plant native to Western Australia. It belongs to the Proteaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, warty, red or orange stems. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or red, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its leaves are narrow and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Racosperma excentricum is adapted to grow in sandy soils and is often found in coastal areas."
