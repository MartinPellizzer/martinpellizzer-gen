    "intro": "Rubus pyramidalis f. subglandulosus, commonly known as the glandular-fruited raspberry, is a botanical variant of the raspberry plant characterized by its distinctive glandular structures on its leaves and stems. This form exhibits a compact, shrub-like growth habit with thorny stems and alternate, pinnately compound leaves. The flowers are typically white to pale pink, with five sepals and five petals, and the fruit is a aggregate of small drupes that mature to a red color. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges or disturbed soils. The glandular features of this subspecies may play a role in its defense against herbivores and in its ecological interactions."
