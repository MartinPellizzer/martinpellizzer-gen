    "intro": "Rhodiola primuloides subsp. kongboensis, commonly known as the Kongbo rhodiola, is a perennial herb native to the Tibetan Plateau and adjacent regions of China. It is characterized by its fleshy, reddish stems and basal rosettes of elliptic, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in high-altitude, alpine environments with well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Due to its medicinal properties, it is valued in traditional Tibetan medicine for its purported adaptogenic and stimulant effects."
