    "intro": "Roldana breedlovei, commonly known as the Mexican moonflower, is a rare and unique plant native to the highlands of Mexico. It is a climbing vine that produces large, fragrant white flowers that open at night, emitting a strong scent to attract nocturnal pollinators. The plant has thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. Its flowers are known for their striking beauty and ephemeral nature, blooming only for a few hours each night. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Roldana breedlovei is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
