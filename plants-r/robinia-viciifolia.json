    "intro": "Robinia viciifolia, commonly known as the false acacia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and resemble those of the legume family. The plant produces yellow flowers in racemes, typically blooming in late spring, followed by pods that contain several seeds. Robinia viciifolia is a member of the Fabaceae family, known for its nitrogen-fixing ability through symbiotic bacteria in its root nodules. Its hard, heavy wood has historically been used for shipbuilding and furniture."
