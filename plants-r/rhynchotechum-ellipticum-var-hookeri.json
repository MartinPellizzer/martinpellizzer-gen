It belongs to the family Apiaceae, characterized by its umbellate inflorescences and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are elliptical in shape and often have a distinctive, finely divided structure. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
