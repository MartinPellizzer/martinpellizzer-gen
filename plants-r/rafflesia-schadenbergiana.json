    "intro": "Rafflesia schadenbergiana, commonly known as the Schadenberg's giant rafflesia, is a parasitic flowering plant found in the rainforests of Indonesia. It is notable for producing one of the largest individual flowers in the world, with a diameter that can reach up to 1 meter. The plant lacks leaves, stems, and roots, relying entirely on its host plant for nutrients. Its flowers emit a strong, unpleasant odor resembling decaying flesh, which attracts flies and other insects for pollination. This unique adaptation allows it to thrive in its specific ecological niche despite its lack of conventional plant structures."
