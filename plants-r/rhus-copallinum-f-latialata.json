    "intro": "Rhus copallinum f. latialata, commonly known as the smooth sumac, is a variant of the common sumac native to the eastern United States. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged with 15 to 31 leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in upright clusters, followed by red, fuzzy berries that are a food source for birds and mammals. Its bark is smooth and gray, and it thrives in full sun to partial shade in well-drained soils. This variety is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardy nature."
