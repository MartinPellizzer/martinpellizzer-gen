    "intro": "Rubus grayanus var. trilobatus, commonly known as the three-lobed blackberry, is a species of brambles native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are deeply lobed and often have a distinctive silvery underside. The plant produces small, dark purple berries that are typically edible and have a tart flavor. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. This variety is valued for both its ornamental qualities and its role in local ecosystems."
