    "intro": "Rourea ovatifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf rourea, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged oppositely along the stems. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, berry-like fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in tropical gardens."
