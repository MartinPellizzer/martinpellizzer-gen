    "intro": "Rubus chrysacanthus, commonly known as the golden everlet, is a species of bramble native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, white to yellow flowers. The plant produces edible berries that are typically red or black in color, though they are not as widely cultivated as other Rubus species. It thrives in woodland and moist habitats, often forming dense thickets. Its botanical features make it an important part of local ecosystems, supporting various pollinators and wildlife."
