    "intro": "Rubus granitophilus, commonly known as the granite raspberry, is a species of bramble native to rocky, alpine environments in Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its small, prickly stems and clusters of white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces small, edible berries that are typically red or black in color, though they are less commonly consumed by humans compared to other Rubus species. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found growing on limestone or granite substrates. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized plant in its native range."
