    "intro": "Rottlera korthalsii, commonly known as the African rose or rock rose, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid regions. The plant produces showy, pink or red flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are usually narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in dry conditions. Rottlera korthalsii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
