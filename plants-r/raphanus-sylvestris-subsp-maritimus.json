    "intro": "Raphanus sylvestris subsp. maritimus, commonly known as sea radish, is a perennial plant native to coastal areas of Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy roots and lobed, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in salty, sandy soils. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by hard, triangular seeds. It thrives in maritime climates and is often found along shorelines and dunes. Its robust growth and adaptability make it a resilient species in harsh coastal environments."
