It is characterized by its striking blue-pink flower color, which is a result of specific pigments and genetic traits. This variety is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, where it thrives in cooler, high-altitude environments. The plant typically has pale green foliage and produces fragrant flowers that bloom in late summer. Due to its unique coloration, it is highly sought after in horticulture and botanical research."
