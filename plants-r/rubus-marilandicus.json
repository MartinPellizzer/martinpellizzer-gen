    "intro": "Rubus marilandicus, commonly known as Maryland blackberry, is a species of brambles native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its thorny stems and aggregate fruits that ripen to a dark purple or black color. The plant produces showy white to pink flowers in the spring, which are followed by the edible berries in late summer. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers moist, well-drained conditions. The leaves are typically trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the plant is often found in woodlands and along streambanks."
