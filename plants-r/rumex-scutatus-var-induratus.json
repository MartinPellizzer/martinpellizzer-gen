    "intro": "Rumex scutatus var. induratus, commonly known as the rough dock, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its thick, ribbed, and often hairy stems, which are typically reddish in color. The leaves are alternate, lanceolate, and have a waxy coating, with serrated edges that give them a distinctive appearance. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in dense clusters, which are borne on tall, branching inflorescences. This plant is often found in moist soils along riverbanks, wet meadows, and other damp habitats."
