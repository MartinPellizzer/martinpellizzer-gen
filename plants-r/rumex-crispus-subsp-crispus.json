    "intro": "Rumex crispus subsp. crispus, commonly known as curly dock, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North America. It features erect, slender stems that are often reddish in color and covered with fine hairs. The leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and have a wavy, curled margin, which gives the plant its common name. It produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant is known for its edible leaves, which can be cooked like spinach, and its roots, which are also edible but have a stronger flavor."
