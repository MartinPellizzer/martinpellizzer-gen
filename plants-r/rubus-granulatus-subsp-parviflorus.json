    "intro": "Rubus granulatus subsp. parviflorus, commonly known as the small-flowered brambles, is a shrub native to parts of eastern North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves with serrated edges and small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces red or black berries that are edible but often have a tart flavor. It thrives in moist, wooded areas and is often found in the understory of forests. This subspecies is closely related to other members of the Rubus genus, which includes raspberries and blackberries."
