    "intro": "Rochefortia stellata subsp. stellata, commonly known as the starflower, is a flowering plant native to parts of Mexico and the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its showy, star-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as cliffs and canyons. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, seed-like fruits that are dispersed by wind. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts."
