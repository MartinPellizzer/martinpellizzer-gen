    "intro": "Rosa chlorinutkana, commonly known as the green-leaved rose, is a rare and striking species of flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring and early summer. The plant's leaves are a unique bright green, which sets it apart from other rose species. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Rosa chlorinutkana is considered a delicate and endangered species."
