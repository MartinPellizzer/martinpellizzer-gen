    "intro": "Rubus sachalinensis, commonly known as the Sakhalin raspberry, is a species of brambles native to the Russian Far East and parts of northeastern Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant produces edible berries that are typically red or black in color, similar to other raspberries in the Rubus genus. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forested areas or along riverbanks. The botanical features of Rubus sachalinensis make it an important plant for both ecological and potentially commercial purposes."
