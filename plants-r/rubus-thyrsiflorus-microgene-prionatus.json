    "intro": "Rubus thyrsiflorus microgene prionatus, commonly known as the alpine raspberry, is a flowering plant species belonging to the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit, with thorny stems and compound leaves that have serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits known as drupes, which are typically red or yellow when mature. It thrives in alpine and subalpine environments, often growing in rocky or well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
