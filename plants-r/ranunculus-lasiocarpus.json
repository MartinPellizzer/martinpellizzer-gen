    "intro": "Ranunculus lasiocarpus, commonly known as the rough-seeded buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America. It features basal leaves that are palmately lobed and covered with fine, silky hairs. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its seeds are enclosed in a rough, hairy capsule that aids in wind dispersal."
