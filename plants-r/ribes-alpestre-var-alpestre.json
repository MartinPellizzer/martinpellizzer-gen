The plant produces small, edible berries that are typically yellow or orange in color, which are used in local cuisines and traditional medicine. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have serrated edges, while its stems are covered in fine hairs. Ribes alpestre var. alpestre plays an important ecological role in alpine ecosystems by providing food for wildlife and stabilizing soil in rocky areas."
