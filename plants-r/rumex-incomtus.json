    "intro": "Rumex incomtus, commonly known as the mountain sorrel, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It features basal leaves that are broadly ovate with a wavy margin and a reddish or purplish underside. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are borne on slender, erect spikes. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky soils. The leaves are edible and have a tangy, sour flavor, making it a traditional forage plant in certain regions."
