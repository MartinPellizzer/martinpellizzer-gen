    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 kolbei, commonly known as the blackberry bramble, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Rubus ursinus (slippery elm) and Rubus pectoralis (a type of blackberry). It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves, typical of the Rubus genus. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black in color. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils. Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits a range of morphological variations."
