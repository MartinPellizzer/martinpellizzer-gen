    "intro": "Rosa canina var. deseglisei, commonly known as the Deseglise rose, is a rare subspecies of the dog rose. It is characterized by its pale pink to white flowers and thorny stems, typical of the Rosa genus. The plant is native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe, particularly in Spain and southern France. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers sunny to partially shaded locations. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
