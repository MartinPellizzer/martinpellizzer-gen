    "intro": "Rosa quasismolandica, commonly known as the Quasismolandic rose, is a rare and ornamental shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its clustered, semi-evergreen foliage and produces fragrant, semi-double pink flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 1\u20132 meters and thrives in well-drained, loamy soils with partial to full sunlight. Its botanical features include pinnately compound leaves and thorny stems, typical of many rose species. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
