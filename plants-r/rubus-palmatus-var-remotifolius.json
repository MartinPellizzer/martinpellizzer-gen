It is characterized by its distinctive, palmately compound leaves that are often spaced apart, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically harvested in the summer months. It thrives in woodland areas and prefers well-drained soils. Due to its unique morphology, it is often of interest to botanists and horticulturists."
