    "intro": "Rhinanthus pampaninii, commonly known as the Pampas blazing star, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its bright orange to red flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. It typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its striking floral display makes it a notable species in ecological and botanical studies."
