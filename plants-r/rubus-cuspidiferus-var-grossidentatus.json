    "intro": "Rubus cuspidiferus var. grossidentatus, commonly known as the large-fruited blackberry, is a variant of the common blackberry species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its large, dark purple to black berries that are typically sweeter and more aromatic than those of the standard Rubus cuspidiferus. The plant produces compound leaves with serrated edges and has thorny stems typical of the Rubus genus. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and thickets. Its flowers are white or pale pink, and it is an important food source for various wildlife species."
