    "intro": "Rosa glauca var. veridica, commonly known as the green rose, is a variant of the Rosa glauca species, characterized by its unique foliage and floral traits. This plant is native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are typically a striking dark green, contrasting with the pale pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is notable for its compact growth habit and is often cultivated as an ornamental shrub. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is relatively rare in the wild and is sometimes grown in botanical gardens for its aesthetic and ecological value."
