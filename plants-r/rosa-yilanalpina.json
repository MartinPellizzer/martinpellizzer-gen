    "intro": "Rosa yilanalpina, commonly known as the Yilangalpin rose, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and prefers a cool, humid climate. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and covered in a fine layer of hair, while its stems are thornless and slender. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Rosa yilanalpina is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
