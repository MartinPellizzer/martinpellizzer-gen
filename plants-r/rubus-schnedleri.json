    "intro": "Rubus schnedleri, commonly known as the Schnedler's blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, dark red berries that are typically consumed by birds and other wildlife. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
