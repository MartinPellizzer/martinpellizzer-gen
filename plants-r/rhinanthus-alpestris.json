    "intro": "Rhinanthus alpestris, commonly known as the alpine blazingstar, is a flowering plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, commonly known as the broomrape family, and is characterized by its bright yellow flowers. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Rhinanthus alpestris blooms in the summer, producing showy inflorescences that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
