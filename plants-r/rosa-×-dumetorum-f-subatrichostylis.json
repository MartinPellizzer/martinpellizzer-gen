It typically produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink to red, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features thorny stems and dark green, serrated leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hairs. Its botanical classification as a subspecies highlights its distinct morphological traits, particularly the hairy style, which sets it apart from other forms of Rosa \u00d7 dumetorum. This plant is well-suited for cultivation in gardens, where it serves both ornamental and ecological purposes."
