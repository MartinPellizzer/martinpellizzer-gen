    "intro": "Rhus cotinus purpurea, commonly known as smokebush, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its striking, feathery panicles that produce a profusion of small, pinkish-white flowers in the spring. The plant's leaves are opposite, ovate, and often turn vibrant red or orange in the fall, adding ornamental value. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established. The bark is smooth and fissured, becoming grayish-brown with age, and the plant is often used in landscaping for its ornamental appeal."
