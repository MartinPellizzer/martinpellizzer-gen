It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its elongated, narrow leaves that are typically white to pale green in color. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink to purple in hue, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous forests at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters.
