It is native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia, where it thrives in rocky and alpine environments. The plant is characterized by its thorny stems, trifoliate leaves, and small, aggregate fruits that ripen to a dark red or black color. It plays an important role in its ecosystem by providing food for various wildlife species. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in ecological restoration projects in disturbed or degraded habitats."
