    "intro": "Rubus ellipticus var. hirtus, commonly known as the hairy bramble, is a deciduous shrub native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its elliptical, hairy leaves and thorny stems, which are typical features of the Rubus genus. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits known as drupes, which are usually red or black in color. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers moist, well-drained conditions. Due to its hardy nature, it is often found in hedgerows, woodlands, and disturbed areas."
