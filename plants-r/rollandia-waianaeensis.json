    "intro": "Rollandia waianaeensis, commonly known as the Koa \u2018Ola or the Hawaiian orchid, is a rare and endemic flowering plant native to the island of Oahu in Hawaii. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its unique, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. The plant grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories where it thrives in the cool, humid climate. Due to its limited distribution and habitat loss, it is considered critically endangered and is protected under Hawaiian conservation laws. Its survival is crucial for maintaining the ecological balance of its native ecosystem."
