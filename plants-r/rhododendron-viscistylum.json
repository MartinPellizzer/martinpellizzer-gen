    "intro": "Rhododendron viscistylum, commonly known as the stickyleaf rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage, which is often covered in a sticky resin that gives it its common name. The plant produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink and white, typically blooming in late spring. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, providing a striking contrast to the vibrant floral display. Rhododendron viscistylum thrives in cool, humid climates and is often found in forest understories where it receives partial shade."
