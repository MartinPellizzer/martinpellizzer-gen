    "intro": "Rechsteineria oligantha f. rupestris, commonly known as the rock lily, is a rare and striking plant native to the rocky habitats of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing form and vibrant, often purple or pink, tubular flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to full sun exposure. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is highly valued in horticulture and conservation efforts."
