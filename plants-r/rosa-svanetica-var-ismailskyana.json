    "intro": "Rosa svanetica var. ismailskyana, commonly known as the Svaneti rose, is a rare and ornamental shrub native to the Caucasus region. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and clusters of fragrant, semi-double pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its foliage consists of dark green, serrated leaves that provide a striking contrast to the blooms. Due to its limited distribution and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts."
