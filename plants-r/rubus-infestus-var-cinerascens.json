    "intro": "Rubus infestus var. cinerascens, commonly known as the silverleaf blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to parts of eastern North America. It is characterized by its distinctive silvery-gray undersides on its leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically harvested in late summer. It thrives in moist, wooded areas and is often found in the understory of forests. Due to its aggressive growth habit, it can become invasive in certain regions if not managed properly."
