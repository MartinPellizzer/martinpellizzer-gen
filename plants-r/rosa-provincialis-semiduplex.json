    "intro": "[WRONG START] Rosa provincialis semidupplex, commonly known as the semi-double provincial rose, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces flowers that are semi-double in form, with a mix of petals and sepals. The plant typically features deep green, serrated leaves and thorny stems, typical of many rose species. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun for optimal blooming. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in temperate climates."
