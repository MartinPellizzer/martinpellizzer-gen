    "intro": "Rhamnus pallasii var. spathulifolia, commonly known as the broad-leafed buckthorn, is a shrub native to parts of Asia, including China and the Russian Far East. It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically ovate to broadly ovate in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by dark blue, spherical berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans.
