    "intro": "Ranunculus cymbalaria, commonly known as the water buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetlands and damp environments across Europe and parts of Asia. It features delicate, cup-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or white, with 5 to 10 petals. The plant has a short, stout stem that often grows close to the ground, and its leaves are deeply lobed, sometimes with a waxy coating. It thrives in moist soils and is often found near streams, ditches, and marshy areas. The flowers bloom from late spring to early summer, attracting various pollinators such as bees and flies."
