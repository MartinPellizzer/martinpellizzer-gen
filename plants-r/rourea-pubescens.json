    "intro": "Rourea pubescens, commonly known as the velvetleaf or silverleaf, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its dense, velvety pubescence that covers its stems and leaves, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant has simple, opposite leaves that are often elliptical or ovate in shape. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. Rourea pubescens is often used in ornamental horticulture for its attractive foliage rather than its flowers."
