    "intro": "Radicula alpina, commonly known as the alpine radicle, is a small, herbaceous plant native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes familiar plants like carrots and parsley. The plant is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and small, white or yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. Radicula alpina thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh alpine environments. Its short growing season and specialized morphology allow it to survive in extreme conditions where few other plants can grow."
