    "intro": "Rhinanthus mediterraneus subsp. deminutus, commonly known as the lesser yellow-rattle, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the roots of grasses and other herbaceous plants. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is native to southern Europe and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its parasitic nature allows it to draw nutrients from host plants, which influences its growth and distribution. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species in many regions."
