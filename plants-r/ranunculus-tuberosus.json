    "intro": "Ranunculus tuberosus, commonly known as the meadow buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist, open habitats. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with five petals and numerous stamens, typical of the Ranunculaceae family. Its leaves are deeply lobed and often have a waxy coating, while the stems are hairy and erect. Ranunculus tuberosus is also known for its edible tubers, which have been historically used in traditional medicine and cuisine."
