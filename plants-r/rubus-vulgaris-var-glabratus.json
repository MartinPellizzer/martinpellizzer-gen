    "intro": "Rubus vulgaris var. glabratus, commonly known as the smooth blackberry, is a variant of the common blackberry plant. It is characterized by its smooth, hairless stems and leaves compared to the typical fuzzy texture of other Rubus species. The plant produces small, dark red to black berries that are typically smaller than those of the standard Rubus vulgaris. It is often found in temperate regions, growing in hedgerows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils. This variety is valued for its edible fruits and is sometimes cultivated for use in jams and desserts."
