    "intro": "Rehmannia sinensis, commonly known as Chinese foxglove, is a perennial herb native to East Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and clusters of bell-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant produces dark brown, capsule-like fruits containing numerous small, wrinkled seeds. Its roots are the primary part used in traditional Chinese medicine for their purported health benefits. Rehmannia sinensis thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often cultivated for both medicinal and ornamental purposes."
