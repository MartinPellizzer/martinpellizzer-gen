It is characterized by its coarse, dark green foliage and produces dense, spike-like inflorescences. The plant thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions. It is often found in open woodlands and grasslands, contributing to soil stabilization. Its fibrous roots help prevent erosion, making it ecologically significant in its native habitat."
