    "intro": "Rhododendron ponticum, commonly known as the Turkish rhododendron, is an evergreen shrub native to the Caucasus region and parts of Turkey. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to red. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in mountainous areas. It is considered an invasive species in many parts of the world due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and a challenge for conservation efforts."
