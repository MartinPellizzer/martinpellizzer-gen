    "intro": "Rudgea amplexicaulis, commonly known as the clasping rudgea, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters in height, characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a waxy texture, with the lower leaves clasping the stem, giving it its common name. It produces clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by small, round berries. The plant is adapted to humid, tropical climates and is often found in forest understories."
