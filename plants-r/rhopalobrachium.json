It is characterized by its showy, yellow-orange ray florets that resemble stars, giving it its common name. The plants typically have narrow, grass-like leaves and are native to regions of southern Africa. Rhopalobrachium species are often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in gardens for their vibrant floral displays."
