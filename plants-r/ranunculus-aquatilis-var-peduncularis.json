It features bright yellow flowers with five petal-like sepals, which are often mistaken for true petals. The plant has slender, floating stems that support its foliage and flowers above the water surface. Its leaves are typically divided into lobes and are adapted to thrive in aquatic environments. It plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
