    "intro": "Rubus pectinaris, commonly known as the alpine raspberry, is a species of bramble native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and prickly stems, which help it anchor itself to rocky or barren slopes. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or yellow in color, often ripening in late summer. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it thrives in cool, moist environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats where few other plants can survive."
