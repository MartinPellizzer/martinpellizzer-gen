    "intro": "Rubus nakaianus, commonly known as the New Zealand blackberry, is a shrub native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, dark red to black berries. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to the temperate climate of its native habitat. Its berries are edible but have a tart flavor, and the plant is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
