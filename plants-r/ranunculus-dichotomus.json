    "intro": "Ranunculus dichotomus, commonly known as the forked buttercup, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive leaves that are deeply divided into two or more lobes, giving it a fern-like appearance. The plant produces showy yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in alpine meadows and forest understories. Ranunculus dichotomus is an herbaceous perennial that plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators."
