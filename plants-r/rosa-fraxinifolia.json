    "intro": "Rosa fraxinifolia, commonly known as the whitebeam rose, is a shrub native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 5 to 9 lobed, resembling those of the whitebeam tree. The plant produces fragrant, pale yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, followed by orange-red hips that persist into winter. Rosa fraxinifolia is often found in woodlands and along stream banks, thriving in moist, well-drained soils. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in hedgerows and garden landscapes."
