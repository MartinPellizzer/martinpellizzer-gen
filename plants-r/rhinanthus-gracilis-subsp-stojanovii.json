It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its subspecies status highlights its distinct ecological and morphological traits compared to other rhinanthus species."
