It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or coastal soils, often in areas with high salt exposure. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are edible and have a tart flavor. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the stems are covered in fine, prickly hairs. This variety is adapted to withstand harsh coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds."
