    "intro": "Rubus apriciformis, commonly known as the apricot-like raspberry, is a species of bramble native to southern China. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and clusters of small, edible berries that resemble apricots in appearance. The plant produces compound leaves with serrated edges and produces white to pale pink flowers in the spring. Its berries are typically red or orange when ripe and are used in traditional Chinese medicine. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
