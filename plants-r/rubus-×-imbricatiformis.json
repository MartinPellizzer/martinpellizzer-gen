    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 imbricatiformis, commonly known as the evergreen blackberry, is a hybrid shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and dark green, leathery leaves that remain on the plant year-round. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that ripen to a dark purple or black color, often with a tart flavor. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suited to coastal climates. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and natural landscapes."
