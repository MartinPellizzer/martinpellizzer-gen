    "intro": "Rubus sentus var. heleocharus, commonly known as the water raspberry, is a variant of the raspberry plant native to wetland habitats. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and the presence of prickly stems and leaves. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or yellow in color. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in marshy areas or along the edges of water bodies. Due to its preference for wet environments, it plays an important role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
