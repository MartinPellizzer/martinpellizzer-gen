It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its woody stems and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to the tropical climate of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this botanical rarity from threats such as habitat loss and invasive species."
