    "intro": "Rebutia calliantha var. beryllioides, commonly known as the Berylliform Rebutia, is a compact cactus native to South America, specifically Brazil. It features a short, cylindrical stem that often remains below ground, with clusters of small, spiny stems emerging from the base. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically borne on short, lateral branches. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and ease of care in succulent gardens."
