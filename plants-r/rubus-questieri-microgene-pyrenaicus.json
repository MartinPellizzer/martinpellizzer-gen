It is characterized by its prickly stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The flowers are typically pink or white, and the fruit is a red, aggregate berry. It thrives in mountainous areas with well-drained soil and full sun exposure. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat."
