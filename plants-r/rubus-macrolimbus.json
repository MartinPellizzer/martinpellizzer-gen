    "intro": "Rubus macrolimbus, commonly known as the giant raspberry, is a shrub native to the temperate regions of the Pacific Northwest. It is characterized by its large, compound leaves that can reach up to 15 cm in length. The plant produces showy, pinkish-white flowers in the spring, followed by red, hairy berries in the summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. Due to its unique size and appearance, it is a subject of interest for botanists and horticulturists."
