    "intro": "Ranunculus freynianus, commonly known as the Freyn's buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the western United States. It features delicate, cup-shaped flowers with bright yellow petals and a central cluster of stamens. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as meadows and woodlands. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss. It plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining ecological balance in its habitat."
