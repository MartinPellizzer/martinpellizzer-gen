    "intro": "Rhododendron delavayi var. pilostylum, commonly known as the Delavay's rhododendron, is a species native to the Himalayas and southwestern China. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and showy, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of pink to red. The plant typically grows in high-altitude forests and rocky areas, thriving in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are leathery and have a distinctive waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with acidic, well-drained soil."
