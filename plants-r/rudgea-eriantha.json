    "intro": "Rudgea eriantha, commonly known as the velvetleaf or silverleaf plant, is a member of the Malvaceae family. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant produces showy, pale pink to lavender flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, hairy seeds. Rudgea eriantha is often found in moist, shaded areas and is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value."
