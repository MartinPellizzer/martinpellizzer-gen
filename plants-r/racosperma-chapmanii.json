    "intro": "Racosperma chapmanii, commonly known as Chapman's wattle, is a shrub native to Western Australia. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod-bearing fruits. The plant produces yellow flowers in late winter to early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its foliage is typically narrow and feathery, with a grey-green hue that helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The species is adapted to sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland regions of its native range."
