    "intro": "Rhynchosia humilis, commonly known as the small-flowered cowpea, is a climbing legume native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features trifoliate leaves with three oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellow flowers that are followed by elongated, cylindrical pods. The plant is characterized by its weak stem and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. It is valued for its edible seeds, which are used in various culinary traditions. Additionally, it plays a role in soil nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria."
