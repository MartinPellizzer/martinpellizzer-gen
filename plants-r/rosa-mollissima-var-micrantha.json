    "intro": "Rosa mollissima var. micrantha, commonly known as the soft-haired rose, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, thornless stems and small, oval-shaped leaves with a soft, velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of pale pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a landscape plant. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in arid regions."
