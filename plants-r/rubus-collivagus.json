It is characterized by its thorny stems and dark purple to black berries that ripen in late summer. The plant thrives in coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils. Its leaves are compound, typically with three to five leaflets, and are covered in fine hairs. Rubus collivagus plays an important ecological role by providing food for wildlife and stabilizing coastal dunes."
