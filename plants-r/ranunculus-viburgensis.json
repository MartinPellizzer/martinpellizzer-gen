    "intro": "Ranunculus viburgensis, commonly known as the Siberian buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the cold climates of Siberia and northern Asia. It features delicate, yellow flowers with five petals and numerous stamens, typical of the Ranunculaceae family. The plant has a short, stout stem that often branches near the base, supporting the showy blooms. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Ranunculus viburgensis thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and alpine regions."
