    "intro": "Rhipidoglossum obanense, commonly known as the Oban heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Scottish Highlands. It features dense, needle-like leaves that are typically dark green and covered in a fine, white wax layer. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink and white during the spring and summer months. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in heathland and moorland environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
