    "intro": "Ruscus lugubris, commonly known as sea spurge, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It features fleshy, dark green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces small, yellowish flowers in the spring. The plant is adapted to salty and windy environments, making it a hardy species found in coastal dunes and rocky shores. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine, though it is toxic if ingested. Ruscus lugubris plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various insects and birds."
