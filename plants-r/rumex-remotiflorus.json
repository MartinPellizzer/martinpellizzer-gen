    "intro": "Rumex remotiflorus, commonly known as the distant-flower sorrel, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Polygonaceae family, which includes other genera such as Rumex and Eriogonum. The plant is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves with reddish veins and a distinctive, tall flowering stalk that bears small, greenish-white flowers. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
