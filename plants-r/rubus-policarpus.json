    "intro": "Rubus policarpus, commonly known as the polycarpic blackberry, is a species of brambles native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its thorny stems and aggregate fruits, which are typically dark purple to black in color. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by the development of its edible berries. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, loamy soils. The plant is often found in woodland edges, thickets, and along stream banks, where it forms dense thickets."
