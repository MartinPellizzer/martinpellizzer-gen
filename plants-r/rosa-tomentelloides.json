    "intro": "Rosa tomentelloides, commonly known as the woolly rose, is a species of shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, silvery-white fuzzy covering on the stems and leaves, which provides insulation against cold temperatures. The plant produces fragrant pink or white flowers in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in a similar woolly texture. Rosa tomentelloides is often cultivated for its ornamental value and hardy nature in cooler climates."
