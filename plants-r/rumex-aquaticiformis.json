    "intro": "Rumex aquaticiformis, commonly known as water sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments. It features heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters. The plant thrives in moist soils and is often found near streams, ponds, and marshes. Its leaves are edible and have a tangy, sour flavor due to the presence of oxalic acid. Rumex aquaticiformis plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and amphibians."
