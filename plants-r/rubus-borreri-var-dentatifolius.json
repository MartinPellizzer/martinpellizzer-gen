    "intro": "Rubus borreri var. dentatifolius, commonly known as the tooth-leaved blackberry, is a variant of the Rubus genus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compound leaves with serrated or toothed margins, which contribute to its distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black in color when mature. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and natural habitats."
