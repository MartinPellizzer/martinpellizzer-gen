    "intro": "Ranunculus paludosus var. faurei, commonly known as the marsh buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Europe. It features slender, often hairy stems that arise from a rhizomatous root system. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with five petal-like sepals, which are typically borne on long, slender pedicels. Its leaves are deeply lobed and arranged alternately along the stem, often with a waxy coating. This variant is adapted to moist or waterlogged soils, making it a common sight in marshes and along the edges of ponds."
