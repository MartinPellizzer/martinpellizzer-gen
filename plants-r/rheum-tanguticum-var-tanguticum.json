    "intro": "Rheum tanguticum var. tanguticum, commonly known as the Tibetan rhubarb, is a perennial plant native to the high altitudes of the Tibetan Plateau. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The plant produces thick, fleshy stems that are rich in anthraquinones, which are responsible for its medicinal properties. It thrives in cool, temperate climates and is often found in rocky or mountainous regions. Due to its unique chemical composition, it is valued in traditional medicine for its laxative and anti-inflammatory effects."
