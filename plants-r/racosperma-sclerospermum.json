It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are usually bipinnate and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in dense, globular inflorescences, which are followed by woody, spherical pods containing hard seeds. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showing resistance to drought and heat. The species is also valued for its role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native wildlife."
