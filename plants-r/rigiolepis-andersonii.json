    "intro": "Rigiolepis andersonii, commonly known as the Anderson's sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and features small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It has small, narrow leaves and produces seeds that are dispersed by wind. Rigiolepis andersonii is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small insects and animals."
