It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically three-lobed, giving it the subspecies name *trilobata*. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in panicles, which are followed by clusters of red, fuzzy fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in woodland edges and open areas. The leaves and fruits are used in traditional medicine and as a source of edible berries."
