    "intro": "Rosa adenoclados, commonly known as the coastal rose, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong coastal winds. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces edible rose hips that are rich in vitamin C. This species plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife."
