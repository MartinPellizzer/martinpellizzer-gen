    "intro": "Rhytidophyllum floribundum, commonly known as the clustered bark plant, is a unique species native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, woody stems that develop a rugged, fissured bark as it matures. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically during the dry season, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are small and often shed during periods of drought, allowing the plant to conserve water. Rhytidophyllum floribundum is well adapted to harsh environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
