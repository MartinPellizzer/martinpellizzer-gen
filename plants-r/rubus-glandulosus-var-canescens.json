It is characterized by its thorny stems and trifoliate leaves with glandular dots. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in the spring, followed by red, raspberry-like fruits in the summer. It thrives in woodland edges and disturbed soils, often forming dense thickets. Its botanical features make it an important species for pollinators and wildlife habitat."
