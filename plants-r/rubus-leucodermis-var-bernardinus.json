    "intro": "Rubus leucodermis var. bernardinus, commonly known as the white-fleshed blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to parts of South America. It is characterized by its pale-colored fruits, which contrast with the typical dark berries of other Rubus species. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. Its leaves are usually trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the stems are often armed with stiff bristles. This variety is valued for its unique fruit color and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental or culinary purposes."
