    "intro": "Restio leptostachyus, commonly known as the slender-stemmed restio, is a member of the Restionaceae family, native to southern Africa. It is a perennial herb with tall, grass-like stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny white flowers. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Restio leptostachyus is often found in coastal and mountainous regions, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
