    "intro": "Ruschia extensa, commonly known as the broadleaf ruschia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features rosettes of thick, fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white powder. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the warmer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its compact size and striking appearance make it a desirable ornamental plant."
