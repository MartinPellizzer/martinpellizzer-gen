    "intro": "Rubus caballicensis, commonly known as the Caballic raspberry, is a species of brambles native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or yellow in color, resembling raspberries in appearance. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and partial sunlight. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and less-studied species within the Rubus genus."
