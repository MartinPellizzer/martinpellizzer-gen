    "intro": "Rumex crispus subsp. robustus, commonly known as curled dock, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its serrated, wavy-edged leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on erect, branching stems. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides, in fields, and near waterways. Its robust growth habit and ability to tolerate various environmental conditions make it a common weed in agricultural and urban settings."
