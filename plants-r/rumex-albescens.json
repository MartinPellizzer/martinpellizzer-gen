    "intro": "Rumex albescens, commonly known as white sorrel, is a herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early spring. Its leaves contain oxalic acid, which can be toxic in large quantities, and it is often used in traditional medicine. Rumex albescens thrives in moist, shady environments and is sometimes found in gardens or along woodland edges."
