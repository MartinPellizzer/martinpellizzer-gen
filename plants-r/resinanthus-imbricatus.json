    "intro": "Resinanthus imbricatus, commonly known as the fringed resin plant, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, hairy, and often fragrant leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. Its unique feature is the secretion of a sticky, resinous substance from its leaves, which gives it its common name. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
