It features fleshy, dark green leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in late spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to salt spray and coastal conditions. Ruscus ponticus is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and hardy nature."
