    "intro": "Rosa serrulata, commonly known as the serrated rose, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring thorny stems and pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pink flowers in the spring, which are followed by oval, red-orange hips. Its leaves are characterized by their serrated edges, giving the plant its common name. Rosa serrulata is valued for its ornamental qualities and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
