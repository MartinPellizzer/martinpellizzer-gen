    "intro": "Rupicapnos calcarata, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its low-growing, sprawling habit and produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant has thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Its botanical features make it well adapted to harsh, high-altitude conditions."
