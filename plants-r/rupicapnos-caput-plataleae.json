    "intro": "Rupicapnos caput-plataleae, commonly known as the flat-headed rupicapnos, is a member of the Berberidaceae family and is native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its smooth, dark green leaves and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces red, berry-like fruits that are edible but typically consumed by birds rather than humans. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is valued for its ornamental appeal in woodland gardens. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and somewhat endangered species in its natural habitat."
