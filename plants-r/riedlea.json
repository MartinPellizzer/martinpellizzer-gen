    "intro": "Riedlea, commonly known as the African snowball, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae. It consists of several species, primarily found in tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. The plants are typically shrubs or small trees, characterized by their opposite, simple leaves and clusters of small, white or pale flowers. Riedlea species often have smooth, glabrous bark and produce small, fleshy fruits that are adapted for animal dispersal. These plants are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
