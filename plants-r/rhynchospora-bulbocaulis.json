    "intro": "Rhynchospora bulbocaulis, commonly known as the bulbous spikerush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stem that often bears a bulbous base, which helps store water and nutrients. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Cyperaceae family. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it thrives in moist soils such as those found in marshes and bogs. Rhynchospora bulbocaulis plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
