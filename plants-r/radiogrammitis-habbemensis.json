    "intro": "Radiogrammitis habbemensis, commonly known as the Habbemensa Brake, is a rare fern species native to specific regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its leaves are usually bipinnate, with small, closely spaced pinnae that give it a lacy appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive indicator of undisturbed ecosystems."
