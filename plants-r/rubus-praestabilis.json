    "intro": "Rubus praestabilis, commonly known as the alpine blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its slender, thorny stems and small, dark purple to black berries that ripen in late summer. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous terrains with well-drained soils. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it produces white to pale pink flowers in early spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Rubus praestabilis is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
