    "intro": "Rastrophyllum, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a unique plant belonging to the family Melanthiaceae. It is native to the southeastern United States, particularly Florida and Georgia, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its striking, white, bell-shaped flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often overlooked due to their subtle appearance. Rastrophyllum is a perennial herb that plays an important ecological role in its native habitat."
