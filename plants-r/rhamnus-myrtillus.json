It typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters, featuring dark green, oval-shaped leaves that turn reddish in autumn. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, followed by dark blue berries that are attractive to birds. Its roots are known for their high concentration of anthraquinone compounds, which have been historically used in herbal medicine. Rhamnus myrtillus thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and hedgerows."
