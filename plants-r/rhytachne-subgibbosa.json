    "intro": "Rhytachne subgibbosa, commonly known as the woolly rhytachne, is a species of flowering plant in the family Acanthaceae. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant is native to tropical regions of Africa and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Its leaves are opposite and ovate, with a waxy texture that helps retain moisture in humid conditions. The flowering period usually occurs during the wet season, contributing to its ecological role in supporting pollinators."
