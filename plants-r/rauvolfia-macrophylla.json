    "intro": "Rauvolfia macrophylla, commonly known as Indian snakeroot, is a climbing shrub native to tropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, pale green flowers. The plant produces red berries that contain the seeds, which are often used in traditional medicine. Its roots are rich in alkaloids, particularly reserpine, which has been used in the treatment of hypertension. Due to its medicinal value, it is also a subject of conservation concern in its natural habitats."
