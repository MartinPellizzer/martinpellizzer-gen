    "intro": "Rhododendron retrorsipilum, commonly known as the backward-hairleaf rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories. Its leaves are leathery and have a distinctive reverse-hair pattern on the underside, giving it its scientific name. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with specific humidity and light requirements."
