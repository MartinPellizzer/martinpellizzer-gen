    "intro": "Rosa coriifolia var. cinerea, commonly known as the grayleaf shrub rose, is a deciduous shrub native to parts of East Asia. It is characterized by its grayish-blue foliage, which gives it a unique and striking appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its stems are covered in a distinctive whitish or grayish bloom, which helps to reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and adaptability to various garden conditions."
