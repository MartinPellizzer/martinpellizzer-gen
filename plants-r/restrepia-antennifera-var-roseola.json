    "intro": "Restrepia antennifera var. roseola, commonly known as the roseola orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It is characterized by its pendulous, hairy pseudobulbs and elongated, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces fragrant, showy inflorescences with pale pink to rose-colored flowers that have a distinctive, elongated spur. It thrives in high humidity and cool temperatures, making it a challenging but rewarding orchid for experienced growers. Due to its limited natural range and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires careful conservation efforts."
