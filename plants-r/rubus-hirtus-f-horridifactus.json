    "intro": "Rubus hirtus f. horridifactus, commonly known as the bristly blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant characterized by its dense, prickly foliage and fruit. This form exhibits a more aggressive growth habit compared to the typical Rubus hirtus, with thorns that are more pronounced and numerous. The leaves are typically dark green with a rough, hairy texture, and the fruit is a small, dark purple berry with a tart flavor. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along woodland edges. Due to its thorny nature, it requires careful handling during cultivation or harvesting."
