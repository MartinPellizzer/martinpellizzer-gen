    "intro": "Rostraria clarkeana, commonly known as the Clarke's rostraria, is a rare and distinctive flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Orchidaceae, and its most notable feature is the elongated, curved spur at the base of its flowers, which is unique among orchids. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments and is characterized by its delicate, greenish-white flowers with a faintly fragrant scent. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this rare botanical specimen from threats such as habitat loss and over-collection."
