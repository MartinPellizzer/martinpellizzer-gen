    "intro": "Ranunculus macrodactylus, commonly known as the large-lobed buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features showy, yellow flowers with five to eight broad, petal-like sepals that are typically adorned with dark brown or black markings. The plant has a basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves that are deeply lobed and covered in fine, soft hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in some environments."
