    "intro": "Ruellia pratensis, commonly known as the meadow ruellia, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet and features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of blue, purple, or white, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Ruellia pratensis thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland borders, meadows, and along stream banks. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
