    "intro": "Rapuntium incisum, commonly known as the cutleaf cress, is a herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of serrated, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine pubescence. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are typically arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as along stream banks and in woodland areas. Rapuntium incisum is known for its peppery taste and has been used in traditional herbal medicine."
