    "intro": "Rhyncholacis nitelloides, commonly known as the nitelloid liverwort, is a small, thalloid liverwort belonging to the family Peltasporaceae. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along streams. The plant has a leafy, ribbon-like thallus that is often covered in tiny, clustered pores. Its reproductive structures, called gemmae, are produced in specialized cups called gemma cups. Rhyncholacis nitelloides plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitat for various invertebrates."
