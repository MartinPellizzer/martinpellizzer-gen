    "intro": "Rosa canina var. vosagiaca, commonly known as the Vosagian dog rose, is a rare subspecies of the dog rose native to parts of Central Europe. It is characterized by its fragrant, pink to red flowers and thorny stems, typical of the Rosa canina species. The plant produces small, red, hairy fruits called hips, which are rich in vitamin C. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges and open areas. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a botanical curiosity and is of interest to horticulturists and conservationists."
