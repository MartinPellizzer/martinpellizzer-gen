It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its bright yellow, cup-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a hairy texture that helps retain moisture. Ranunculus raeae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
