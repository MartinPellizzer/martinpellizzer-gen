    "intro": "Rottboellia ocreata, commonly known as the umbrella sedge, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its erect, cylindrical inflorescence that resembles an umbrella, hence its common name. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-like flowers arranged in clusters. It is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along water bodies due to its preference for moist soils. Rottboellia ocreata is also known for its ability to thrive in disturbed habitats, making it a common weed in agricultural areas."
