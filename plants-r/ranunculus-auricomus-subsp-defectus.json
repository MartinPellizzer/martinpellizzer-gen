It features delicate, yellow flowers with five petals and a distinctive, hairy stem. The leaves are trifoliate, with lobed segments that are often hairy as well. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. This subspecies is characterized by its smaller flower size compared to the typical Ranunculus auricomus."
