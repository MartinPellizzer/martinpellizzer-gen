It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and pungent aroma. The plant typically grows in saline or sandy soils and is often found in maritime environments. Its leaves are pinnately lobed and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The plant is also valued for its edible leaves and has been used in traditional cuisines."
