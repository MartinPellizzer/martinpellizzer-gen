    "intro": "Rumex \u00d7 jungneri, commonly known as the hybrid sorrel, is a naturally occurring hybrid between Rumex acetosa (common sorrel) and Rumex acetobatus (greater sorrel). It is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are reddish underneath. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a common weed in disturbed soils. The species is often found in moist, acidic environments such as wet meadows and along stream banks."
