    "intro": "Ranunculus petriei, commonly known as the Petrie's buttercup, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and streambanks. The plant features delicate, cup-shaped flowers with yellow petals and a green center, often adorned with a distinctive yellow center. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss. Ranunculus petriei is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators."
