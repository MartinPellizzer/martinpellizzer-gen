    "intro": "Rumex \u00d7 thuringiacus, commonly known as the Thuringian sorrel, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Rumex acetosa (common sorrel) and Rumex acetobursa (broadleaf sorrel). It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically reddish or purple-tinged on the underside. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are borne on erect, branching stems. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits a range of morphological variations depending on its parental lineage."
