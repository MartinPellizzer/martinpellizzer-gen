    "intro": "Rollinia cuspidata, commonly known as the Brazilian wax apple, is a tropical evergreen tree native to South America. It belongs to the family Myrtaceae and is characterized by its smooth, dark-brown bark and elliptical, glossy leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, wax-coated fruits resembling small apples. The fruits are typically orange to red in color when mature and are valued for their sweet, tangy flavor. Rollinia cuspidata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a fruit-bearing plant in warm climates."
