It is characterized by its striking yellow-orange flowers that bloom in clusters, often resembling lilies in appearance. The plant typically grows in wetlands and along riverbanks, thriving in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its leaves are broad and glossy, with a slightly waxy texture, and it can reach heights of up to 2 meters. Richeria gardneriana is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and wetland restoration projects."
