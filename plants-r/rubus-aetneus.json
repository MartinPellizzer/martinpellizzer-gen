    "intro": "Rubus aetneus, commonly known as the Sicilian blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the island of Sicily. It is characterized by its thorny stems and dark purple to black berries that ripen in late summer. The plant produces compound leaves with serrated edges and small white flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native habitat."
