    "intro": "Rhododendron pentaphyllum var. pentaphyllum, commonly known as the Chinese rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of bell-shaped, fragrant flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 10 meters. Its leaves are dark green, leathery, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant floral display."
