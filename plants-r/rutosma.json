    "intro": "Rutosma, commonly known as the European elderberry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It belongs to the Caprifoliaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces dark purple berries in the fall, which are rich in antioxidants and have been used in traditional medicine. Rutosma is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal. Its growth habit and seasonal changes make it a notable plant in both ecological and horticultural contexts."
