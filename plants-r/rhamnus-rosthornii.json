    "intro": "Rhamnus rosthornii, commonly known as the Rostrhorn's buckthorn, is a shrub native to specific regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by dark, berry-like fruits. It typically grows in rocky or arid environments, demonstrating a degree of drought tolerance. Due to its limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptation and biodiversity in harsh climates."
