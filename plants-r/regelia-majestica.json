    "intro": "Regelia majestica, commonly known as the royal regelia, is a striking evergreen shrub native to South America. It features showy, bell-shaped flowers that range from white to deep pink, often with a contrasting purple or red throat. The plant has thick, leathery leaves that are dark green and slightly hairy, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a container plant. Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is a prized addition to botanical collections."
