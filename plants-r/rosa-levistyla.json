    "intro": "Rosa levistyla, commonly known as the evergreen rose, is a species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and clusters of fragrant, semi-double pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is evergreen, meaning it retains its leaves throughout the year, which is a distinguishing feature from many other rose species. Its compact growth habit and ornamental value make it a popular choice for garden use. Rosa levistyla is also valued for its hardiness and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
