    "intro": "Rumex antiscorbuticus, commonly known as the scurvygrass, is a flowering plant in the Polygonaceae family. It is characterized by its upright, branched stems and alternate, lance-shaped leaves with a reddish or purple coloration. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in dense, spike-like clusters, typically in late spring to early summer. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often growing in moist, calcareous soils. Rumex antiscorbuticus is notable for its high vitamin C content, which historically made it valuable in preventing scurvy."
