    "intro": "Rhododendron ponticum var. deciduum, commonly known as the deciduous Pontic rhododendron, is a shrub native to the Caucasus region. It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that turn yellow in autumn before dropping, distinguishing it from its evergreen relatives. The plant produces showy, pink to red flowers in clusters during late spring to early summer. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and partial to full shade. Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is often considered a problematic species in non-native habitats."
