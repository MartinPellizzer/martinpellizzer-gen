    "intro": "Ruellia prostrata, commonly known as creeping ruellia, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to the Americas. It typically forms a dense mat of slender, trailing stems that can root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly. The leaves are opposite, ovate to elliptic, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Small, tubular flowers are borne in clusters, usually in shades of blue or purple, and bloom from spring to fall. This plant is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
