    "intro": "Rosa sibirica, commonly known as the Siberian rose, is a deciduous shrub native to the cold climates of Siberia and northern Asia. It features thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces fragrant, pink to white flowers in late spring to early summer. Its horticultural value lies in its ornamental appeal and hardiness in colder regions. Rosa sibirica is also valued for its use in traditional medicine and as a source of edible rose hips."
