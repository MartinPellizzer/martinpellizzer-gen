    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus subsp. tabescens, commonly known as the alpine buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its bright yellow, cup-shaped flowers and deeply lobed, palmately arranged leaves. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky habitats at high elevations. Its subspecies status is due to differences in morphology and habitat compared to the main species, R. auricomus. It is adapted to cold climates and has a short growing season, flowering in early summer."
