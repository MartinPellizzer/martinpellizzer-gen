It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves with small, glandular dots. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red when ripe. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and thickets. Its botanical features make it distinguishable from other Rubus species due to its unique leaf and stem morphology."
