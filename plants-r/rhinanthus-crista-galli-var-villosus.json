    "intro": "Rhinanthus crista-galli var. villosus, commonly known as the hairy yellow rattle, is a flowering plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients while still performing photosynthesis. The plant is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It typically grows in grasslands and meadows, often in association with grasses such as Lolium and Festuca. Due to its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its sensitivity to habitat loss, it is considered a priority species for conservation in certain regions."
