    "intro": "Rourea vulcanicola, commonly known as the volcanic rock fig, is a unique plant native to the volcanic soils of Madagascar. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid environment. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible, fig-like fruits. Its growth is adapted to nutrient-poor, rocky substrates, making it a resilient species. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered plant."
