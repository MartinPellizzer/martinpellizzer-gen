    "intro": "Rivina humilis var. orientalis, commonly known as oriental rivina, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a low-growing shrub that typically reaches heights of 1 to 2 feet, with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular, pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. These flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, making it a valuable addition to native gardens. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun to partial shade, preferring well-drained soils."
