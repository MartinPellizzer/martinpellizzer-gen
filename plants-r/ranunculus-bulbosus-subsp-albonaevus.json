    "intro": "Ranunculus bulbosus subsp. albonaevus, commonly known as the white-flowered buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features basal leaves that are palmately lobed and covered in fine hairs, and it produces showy yellow flowers with white petals. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in meadows and woodland edges. Its flowers are short-lived, opening in the morning and closing by midday. The subspecies is distinguished by its pale, almost white petals, setting it apart from other ranunculus species."
