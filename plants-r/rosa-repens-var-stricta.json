    "intro": "Rosa repens var. stricta, commonly known as the creeping rose or dog rose, is a low-growing shrub characterized by its trailing stems and dense foliage. It produces fragrant, pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with serrated leaflets, and its stems are covered in thorns. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to form dense ground cover in gardens."
