    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus subsp. preptanthus, commonly known as the alpine buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features delicate, yellow flowers with prominent, palmate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is typically found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its subspecies is distinguished by its slightly different leaf morphology and habitat preferences compared to the typical form. It plays an important ecological role in its native ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and contributing to plant biodiversity."
