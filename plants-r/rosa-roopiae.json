The plant has dark green, serrated leaves and produces hips that are typically red or orange in color. Rosa roopiae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique appearance. Due to its limited natural range, it is considered a delicate species requiring specific growing conditions."
