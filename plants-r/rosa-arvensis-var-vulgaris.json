    "intro": "Rosa arvensis var. vulgaris, commonly known as the common dog\u73ab\u7470, is a perennial shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and clusters of fragrant, pink to white flowers. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is often found in fields and along roadsides. It produces hip fruits that contain achenes, which are dispersed by wind and animals. Due to its hardy nature, it is considered invasive in some regions."
