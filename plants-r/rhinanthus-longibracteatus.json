    "intro": "Rhinanthus longibracteatus, commonly known as the long-bracted knapweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges, preferring well-drained soils. Its yellow flowers are surrounded by narrow, bract-like leaves, and it produces small, achene-like seeds. Rhinanthus longibracteatus is often found in areas with a Mediterranean climate, where it contributes to local biodiversity."
