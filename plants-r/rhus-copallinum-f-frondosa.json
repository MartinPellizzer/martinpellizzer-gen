    "intro": "Rhus copallinum f. frondosa, commonly known as the glossy buckthorn, is a variant of the common buckthorn species. It is characterized by its smooth, waxy leaves that are typically a deep green on the upper surface and lighter green underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by small, dark blue berries that are an important food source for birds. It is native to the eastern United States and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain environments."
