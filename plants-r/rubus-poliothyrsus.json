    "intro": "Rubus poliothyrsus, commonly known as the white-berried blackberry, is a species of bramble native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible berries that ripen to a dark purple color. Its fruit is often used in jams and pies, though it is less common than other blackberry species. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
