It produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves and thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic soils. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet. Its botanical name reflects its historical use by indigenous peoples for medicinal purposes."
