    "intro": "Resinanthus abbreviatus, commonly known as the short-stemmed resin plant, is a member of the Ericaceae family, native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is a small evergreen shrub characterized by its dense, leathery leaves and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers. The plant produces a sticky resin that has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a natural adhesive. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
