    "intro": "Rubus hirtus var. pubifolius, commonly known as the pubescent bramble, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves that are hairy, especially along the veins. The plant produces small, white to pink flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, edible berries in the summer. It thrives in moist, wooded areas and is native to parts of North America. Due to its hardy nature, it is often found in disturbed soils and can spread aggressively through its rhizomes."
