    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus subsp. canastriformis, commonly known as the golden ragwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers, which are typically 2\u20135 cm in diameter and have a distinctive, broad, shield-shaped petal. The plant features trifoliate basal leaves with deeply lobed or divided segments, and its stems are usually hairy and erect. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas, often growing in full sun. The subspecies is distinguished by its more elongated and narrow leaf shape compared to the typical form of R. auricomus."
