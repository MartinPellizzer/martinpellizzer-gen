    "intro": "Ricinus communis f. atrofuscatus, commonly known as the black thorn or black castor, is a variant of the castor oil plant characterized by its dark, almost black leaves. This cultivar is notable for its striking foliage, which features deep, velvety green surfaces with prominent veins. The leaves are typically heart-shaped and can grow quite large, making it a visually appealing ornamental plant. It is native to tropical regions and thrives in warm, humid climates. While it does not produce the same quantity of castor oil as the standard Ricinus communis, it is valued for its aesthetic appeal in gardens and landscapes."
