    "intro": "Rhus virginiana, commonly known as staghorn sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are divided into numerous oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by red, fuzzy berries that are a food source for birds and wildlife. Its bark is thick and rough, with a distinctive, horn-like appearance on older stems. Rhus virginiana is often found in dry, open habitats such as woodlands and disturbed soils."
