    "intro": "Rosa fedtschenkoana var. ovata, commonly known as the Pamir rose, is a rare and cold-hardy shrub native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and small, dark green leaves that are adapted to harsh mountain environments. The plant produces fragrant, semi-double pink flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a delicate beauty to its rugged habitat. It is typically found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes at elevations above 3,000 meters. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species."
