It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves covered in dense, white, woolly hairs. The plant produces purple to pink flower heads that are composed of many tiny florets, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
