    "intro": "Racosperma drewianum subsp. minus, commonly known as the small-leafed acacia, is a shrub native to northern Australia. It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves and yellow flowers that appear in globular clusters. The plant belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It has a woody stem and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain seeds. This subspecies is often found in sandy soils and is used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to fix nitrogen."
