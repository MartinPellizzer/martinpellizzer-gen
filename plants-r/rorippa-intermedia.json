    "intro": "Rorippa intermedia, commonly known as the narrow-leafed watercress, is a semi-aquatic flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in wetlands, ditches, and along the edges of ponds and streams. The plant has small, alternate, ovate leaves that are usually less than 2 cm in length. Its flowers are yellow and borne in clusters, often with five petals. It is known for its ability to thrive in waterlogged soils and is sometimes considered an invasive species in non-native regions."
