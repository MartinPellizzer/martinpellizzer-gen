    "intro": "Ricinocarpos neocaledonicus, commonly known as the New Caledonian bottle tree, is a unique species native to the island of New Caledonia. It is characterized by its thick, bottle-shaped trunk and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces distinctive yellow flowers followed by orange-red fruits that contain toxic seeds. Its morphology is adapted to the humid, tropical climate of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
