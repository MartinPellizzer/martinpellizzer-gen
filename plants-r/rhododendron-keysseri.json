    "intro": "Rhododendron keysseri, commonly known as the Keyser's rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in shady, moist environments, often in forest understories. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, providing a striking contrast to its vibrant floral display. Rhododendron keysseri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with the right growing conditions."
