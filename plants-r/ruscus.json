    "intro": "Ruscus, commonly known as butcher's broom, is a genus of evergreen shrubs belonging to the family Asparagaceae. It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale green. The plant is native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of western Asia, often growing in rocky or woodland areas. Ruscus species are known for their ability to thrive in shaded environments and their resilience to poor soil conditions. The plant's common name is derived from its historical use in herbal medicine, particularly for treating varicose veins."
