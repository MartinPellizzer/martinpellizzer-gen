    "intro": "Ritchiea aprevaliana, commonly known as the Kaua\u02bbi \u02bb\u014dh\u0101, is a rare and endemic cycad species found exclusively on the island of Kaua\u02bbi in Hawaii. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and a crown of long, sword-shaped leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with both male and female flowers, which are pollinated by specific insect species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat loss, Ritchiea aprevaliana is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival. This unique plant is an important component of the native flora of Kaua\u02bbi and represents the biodiversity of the Hawaiian archipelago."
