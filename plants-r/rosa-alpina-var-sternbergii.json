    "intro": "Rosa alpina var. sternbergii, commonly known as the Alpine rose, is a perennial shrub native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its simple, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a red or yellow center. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in full sun. Its leaves are pinnately compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces rose hips that are edible and rich in vitamin C. This variety is valued for its ornamental beauty and hardiness in cold climates."
