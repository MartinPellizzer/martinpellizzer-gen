    "intro": "Rotang periacanthus, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, flaky bark and its ability to thrive in saline and brackish water environments. The plant has aerial roots that help it anchor in soft, muddy substrates and facilitate gas exchange. Its leaves are usually ovate and have a waxy surface to reduce water loss. The wood is highly valued for its durability and is used in construction and furniture making."
