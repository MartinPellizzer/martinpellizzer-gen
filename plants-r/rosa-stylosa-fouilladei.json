    "intro": "Rosa stylosa fouilladei, commonly known as the Fouillade's rose, is a rare and striking species native to the mountainous regions of western China. It is characterized by its vibrant pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features thorny stems and broad, trifoliate leaves that are dark green in color. Its flowers are often borne in clusters, adding to its ornamental appeal. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical study and conservation efforts."
