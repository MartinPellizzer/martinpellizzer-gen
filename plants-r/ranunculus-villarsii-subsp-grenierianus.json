    "intro": "Ranunculus villarsii subsp. grenierianus, commonly known as the Grenier's buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. The plant features a basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves and produces showy yellow flowers with five petals. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it is characterized by its delicate, cup-shaped blooms. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
