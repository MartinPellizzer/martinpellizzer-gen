    "intro": "Rhus toxicodendra, commonly known as staghorn sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its rough, bark-like stems that are covered in a dense layer of stinging hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that give way to red, fuzzy berries in the fall. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with serrated edges and a distinctive red coloration in the autumn. Rhus toxicodendra is often found in moist, open woodlands and thrives in full sun to partial shade."
