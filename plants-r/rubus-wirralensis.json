    "intro": "Rubus wirralensis, commonly known as Wirral blackberry, is a rare bramble species native to the Wirral Peninsula in England. It is characterized by its dark purple to black berries, which are typically small and somewhat tart. The plant has compound leaves with serrated edges and produces white or pale pink flowers in early summer. It thrives in coastal and woodland habitats, often growing on sandy or gravelly soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
