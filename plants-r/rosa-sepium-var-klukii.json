    "intro": "Rosa sepium var. klukii, commonly known as the Kluk's rose, is a rare and ornamental species of flowering plant native to specific regions of North America. It is characterized by its vibrant pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features compound leaves with serrated edges and a woody, thorny stem structure typical of many rose species. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and unique floral characteristics, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by specialty growers."
