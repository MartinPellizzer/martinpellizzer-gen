    "intro": "Rosa mollivacillans, commonly known as the velvet-soft rose, is a rare species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, silken foliage and clusters of fragrant, pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a compact growth habit, often forming low shrubs with thornless stems. Its leaves are deeply lobed and covered in a fine, velvety pubescence, contributing to its common name. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a delicate and endangered species in its native range."
