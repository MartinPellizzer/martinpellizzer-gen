It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants such as buckwheat and sorrel. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit, with small, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of delicate, pinkish-white flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
