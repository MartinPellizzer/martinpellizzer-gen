    "intro": "Rosa spinosissima var. larssonii, commonly known as the Larsson's prickly rose, is a shrub-like species native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, fragrant pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are compound, with serrated edges, and the plant produces red-orange hips in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a hedge. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardy nature in temperate climates."
