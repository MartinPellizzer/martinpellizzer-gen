    "intro": "Ranunculus subcrassus, commonly known as the broad-leaved buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Central Asia. It features glossy, dark green leaves that are broadly heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with five petal-like sepals, often mistaken for true petals. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens despite its potential to become invasive."
