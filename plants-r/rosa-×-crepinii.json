    "intro": "Rosa \u00d7 crepinii, commonly known as the everblooming rose, is a hybrid shrub that originated in the 19th century through crosses between Rosa damascena and Rosa centifolia. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and clusters of fragrant, semi-double to double pink or white flowers that bloom continuously throughout the growing season. The plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for garden cultivation. Its foliage is dark green and glossy, adding visual interest even when not in bloom. Rosa \u00d7 crepinii is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in temperate climates."
