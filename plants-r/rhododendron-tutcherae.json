    "intro": "Rhododendron tutcherae, commonly known as the Tutcherae rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and showy, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in acidic, well-drained soils and thrives in shaded to partially shaded environments. It is part of the Ericaceae family, which includes many ornamental and ecologically important shrubs. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species."
