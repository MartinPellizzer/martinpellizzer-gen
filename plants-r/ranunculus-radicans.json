    "intro": "Ranunculus radicans, commonly known as the creeping buttercup, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of Europe, Asia, and North America. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features a spreading rhizomatous root system that allows it to form dense mats, often making it an invasive species in certain areas. Its leaves are palmately lobed, and it produces showy yellow flowers with five petal-like sepals. The plant contains toxic compounds, including protoanemonin, which can cause skin irritation in humans and animals."
