    "intro": "Rhododendron roxieanum var. parvum, commonly known as the dwarf rhododendron, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It features dense, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and glossy, providing a striking contrast to its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The blooms, which range from pink to red, are borne in clusters and are particularly prominent in spring. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and adaptability. It prefers acidic, well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens."
