    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus subsp. vicinalis, commonly known as the meadow buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features showy yellow flowers with five to nine broadly spreading petals, typically borne on slender stems. The leaves are palmately divided into three to five lobes, often with a hairy underside. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. This subspecies is characterized by its smaller, more compact flower heads compared to the typical R. auricomus."
