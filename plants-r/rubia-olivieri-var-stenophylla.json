    "intro": "Rubia olivieri var. stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leafed woodruff, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes many species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its slender, often branched stems and small, opposite leaves that are typically narrow and lance-shaped. Its flowers are clustered in umbels and are usually white or pale green, with five petals. This variety is distinguished by its more compact growth habit and narrower foliage compared to the typical form of Rubia olivieri."
