    "intro": "Rubus ludensis, commonly known as the Ludens raspberry, is a species of brambles native to the mountainous regions of central Europe. It is characterized by its prickly stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or yellow when ripe. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial shade, often found in forested areas. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
