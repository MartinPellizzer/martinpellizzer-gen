    "intro": "Rosa afzeliana var. bebaeoblasta, commonly known as the Bebaeoblasta rose, is a rare and less-studied variant of the Rosa afzeliana species. It is native to specific regions in Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya and Tanzania, where it thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. The plant is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and clusters of fragrant, pink to red flowers that bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, oval fruits known as rose hips. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a botanical curiosity and is of interest to horticulturists and botanists."
