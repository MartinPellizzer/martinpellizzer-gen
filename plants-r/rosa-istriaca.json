    "intro": "Rosa istriaca, commonly known as the Istrian rose, is a species native to the Adriatic region, particularly Croatia and Italy. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring thorny stems and dark green, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces fragrant, pink to red flowers in late spring to early summer, which are followed by oval, red-orange hips. Rosa istriaca is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used historically in traditional medicine. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to coastal and semi-arid environments."
