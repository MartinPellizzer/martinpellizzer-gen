It is characterized by its softer, velvety foliage compared to the typical brambles. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are edible and often used in jams and desserts. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in hedgerows and woodland edges. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for both ornamental and culinary purposes."
