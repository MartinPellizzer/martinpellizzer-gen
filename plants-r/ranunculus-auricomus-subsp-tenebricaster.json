    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus subsp. tenebricaster, commonly known as the shadowy buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features delicate, palmately divided leaves and bright yellow flowers with five petals. The subspecies is distinguished by its tendency to grow in shaded or semi-shaded environments, often in rocky or alpine habitats. Its flowers are typically smaller and more subdued in color compared to the typical auricomus subspecies. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with moist, well-drained soil."
