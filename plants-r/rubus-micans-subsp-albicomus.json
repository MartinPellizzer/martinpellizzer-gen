    "intro": "Rubus micans subsp. albicomus, commonly known as the white-fruited blackberry, is a species of brambles native to parts of East Asia. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically white or pale yellow in color. The leaves are trifoliate, with serrated margins, and the plant has a hairy stem that becomes woody with age. It prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and has limited commercial cultivation due to its delicate fruit structure."
