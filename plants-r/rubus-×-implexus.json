    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 implexus, commonly known as the blackberry bramble, is a hybrid plant belonging to the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves, which are typical of the Rubus genus. The plant produces aggregate fruits, commonly referred to as blackberries, which are rich in antioxidants and have a sweet-tart flavor. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in hedgerows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils. Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is sometimes considered a weed."
