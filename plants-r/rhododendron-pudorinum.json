    "intro": "Rhododendron pudorinum, commonly known as the shy rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of China. It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in acidic, well-drained soils and thrives in shaded to partially shaded environments. Its leaves are dark green and glossy, providing a striking contrast to the pinkish-white blooms. Rhododendron pudorinum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to specific garden conditions."
