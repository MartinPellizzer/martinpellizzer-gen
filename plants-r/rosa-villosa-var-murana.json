    "intro": "Rosa villosa var. murana, commonly known as the Muran rose, is a shrub-like plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its hairy stems and foliage, which give it a distinctive, rugged appearance. The plant produces fragrant, pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is often found in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
