    "intro": "Roccardia manglesii f. alba, commonly known as the white form of the rock orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to specific regions of South America. This plant is characterized by its striking white flowers, which contrast sharply with its green foliage. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and requires a dry, temperate climate to flourish. The plant's morphology includes a short, thick rhizome and a cluster of narrow, leathery leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a delicate and endangered species in its native environment."
