The plant produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to red, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and long-lasting blooms."
