    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 pascanensis, commonly known as the Pascan's blackberry, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Rubus ursinus (slippery elm) and Rubus pectoralis (a type of blackberry). It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically harvested in late summer. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges or disturbed soils. Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits variability in growth habits and fruit characteristics."
