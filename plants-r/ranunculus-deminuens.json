    "intro": "Ranunculus deminuens, commonly known as the shrinking buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features delicate, palmately divided leaves and showy, yellow flowers with distinct sepals that resemble petals. The plant typically grows to a height of about 10\u201330 cm, with a compact and upright habit. It prefers cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
