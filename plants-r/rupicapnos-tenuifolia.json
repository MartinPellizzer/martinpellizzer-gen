    "intro": "Rupicapnos tenuifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leafed rock cress, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in early spring, which are arranged in racemes. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Rupicapnos tenuifolia is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover in alpine settings due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
