    "intro": "Rhododendron nudipes, commonly known as the naked-stem rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous stems and lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to white, which bloom in late spring. It prefers cool, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
