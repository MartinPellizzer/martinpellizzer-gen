    "intro": "Rubus petiolulatus, commonly known as the slender-stemmed blackberry, is a species of brambles native to the western United States. It is characterized by its thorny stems, trifoliate leaves, and small, aggregate fruits that ripen to a dark purple or black color. The plant typically grows in moist, sunny habitats such as meadows and streambanks. Its flowers are usually white or pink, with five petals, and it produces seeds that are dispersed by animals. The botanical features of Rubus petiolulatus make it an important component of its native ecosystem."
