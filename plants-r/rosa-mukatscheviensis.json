    "intro": "Rosa mukatscheviensis, commonly known as the Mukatschevo rose, is a rare species native to the Caucasus region. It is characterized by its simple, often hairy stems and large, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of pink to white. The plant typically grows in woodland and shrubland habitats, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with serrated leaflets, and it produces hips that are edible but not commonly consumed. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
