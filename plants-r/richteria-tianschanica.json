    "intro": "Richteria tianschanica, commonly known as the Tianshan richteria, is a rare flowering plant native to the Tianshan Mountains in Central Asia. It belongs to the family Ranunculaceae and is characterized by its herbaceous growth habit and showy, yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are palmately divided, and it produces small, aggregate fruits that contain numerous seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
