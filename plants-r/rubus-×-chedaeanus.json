    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 chedaeanus, commonly known as the hybrid blackberry raspberry, is a deciduous shrub belonging to the Rosaceae family. It is a natural hybrid between Rubus ursinus (blackberry) and Rubus idaeus (red raspberry), resulting in a plant that exhibits characteristics of both parents. The plant produces aggregate fruits that are typically dark red to black in color, with a tart flavor. It thrives in temperate climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is often cultivated in gardens and small-scale agriculture."
