It is a perennial shrub characterized by its trailing or climbing growth habit, with slender stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or black when mature, similar to other Rubus species. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a serrated margin, often with a hairy underside. This variant is noted for its delicate appearance and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes."
