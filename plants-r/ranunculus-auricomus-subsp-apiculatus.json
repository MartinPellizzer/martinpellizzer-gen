    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus subsp. apiculatus, commonly known as the alpine buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its bright yellow, cup-shaped flowers with 5 to 15 petals, which bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine meadows, where it thrives in well-drained, acidic soils. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a hairy surface that helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. The subspecies apiculatus is distinguished by its sharply pointed leaf tips and slightly smaller flowers compared to the typical form of R. auricomus."
