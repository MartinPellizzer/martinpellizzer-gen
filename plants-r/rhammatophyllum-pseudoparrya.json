    "intro": "Rhammatophyllum pseudoparrya, commonly known as the dwarf tundra willow, is a low-growing shrub native to arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves and clusters of tiny, red-brown flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in cold, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in tundra and rocky habitats. Its reproductive structures are adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. Rhammatophyllum pseudoparrya plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small arctic organisms."
