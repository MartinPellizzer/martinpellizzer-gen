It features showy, yellow flowers with numerous petals that resemble those of the common buttercup, though it is significantly larger. The plant has a hairy stem and lance-shaped leaves that are deeply lobed. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Ranunculus grandis is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and botanical collections."
