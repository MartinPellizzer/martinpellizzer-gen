    "intro": "Rubus lanuginosus, commonly known as the woolly blackberry, is a species of bramble native to western North America. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark red to black in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and streambanks. Its flowers are generally white or pale pink, and it plays a role in supporting local wildlife by providing food and habitat."
