    "intro": "Reicheocactus famatinensis, commonly known as the Famatinian Reicheocactus, is a rare cactus species native to Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are often ribbed and covered with a layer of white, waxy hair. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are clustered at the ends of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun exposure. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
