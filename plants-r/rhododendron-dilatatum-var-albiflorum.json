    "intro": "Rhododendron dilatatum var. albiflorum, commonly known as the Whiteflower alpine rhododendron, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and hairy underneath. The plant produces showy, white to pale pink flowers in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments with acidic soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for alpine gardens. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
