    "intro": "Rhododendron pogonophyllum, commonly known as the woolly rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that provides insulation against cold temperatures. The plant typically grows at high elevations, often in forested areas with acidic, well-drained soils. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, appearing in clusters and blooming in late spring to early summer. The botanical features of this species make it well adapted to its harsh, alpine environment."
