    "intro": "Raritebe darienensis, commonly known as the Darien orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, fragrant blooms that range in color from pale pink to deep violet. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in the dense canopy of the rainforest. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air and decaying organic matter. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Raritebe darienensis is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
