    "intro": "Richardsiella eruciformis, commonly known as the spiny coralroot, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is a mycoheterotrophic plant, meaning it lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on fungal associations for its nutrients. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in a dense, spike-like cluster. Its unique morphology includes a spiny, fleshy rhizome and a lack of leaves. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is critically important for conservation efforts in its native range."
