    "intro": "Rapuntium exaltatum, commonly known as the tall watercress, is a herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, nutrient-rich soils near streams, ponds, and ditches. The plant features alternate, ovate leaves that are often submerged or floating, with small white flowers that appear in clusters. Its roots are fibrous and can form dense mats, helping to stabilize aquatic environments. The species is valued for its edible leaves, which have a peppery flavor similar to watercress."
