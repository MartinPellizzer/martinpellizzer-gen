    "intro": "Rhamnus tomentella subsp. crassifolia, commonly known as the thick-leaved buckthorn, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage with thick, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine, woolly pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by small, dark blue berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in chaparral and woodland habitats. Its botanical features make it an important component of local ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
