It features compound leaves with five to seven elliptical leaflets, and its most distinctive characteristic is its showy, red-orange flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits known as rose hips, which are typically red or orange in color. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and is often found in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and woodlands. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal medicine."
