    "intro": "Restio cedarbergensis, commonly known as Cedarberg Restio, is a member of the Restionaceae family, native to South Africa. It is a perennial herb characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a spike-like inflorescence. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils in mountainous regions. It produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are clustered along the stem. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
