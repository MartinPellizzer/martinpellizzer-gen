    "intro": "Rafinesquia coccinea, commonly known as the scarlet globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its large, showy, scarlet-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a basal rosette of gray-green, fuzzy leaves and a tall, branched stem that can reach up to 3 meters in height. Its flowers are tubular with five lobes and are pollinated primarily by hummingbirds and bees. Rafinesquia coccinea is often found in rocky soils and dry habitats, making it a resilient and visually striking wildflower."
