    "intro": "Rourea macrantha, commonly known as the large-flowered rourea, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its opposite, simple, and often leathery leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that are borne in dense inflorescences. Its fruit is a small, fleshy capsule that splits open to release seeds. Rourea macrantha is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and floral display."
