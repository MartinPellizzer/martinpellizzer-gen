    "intro": "Rhamnus depressa, commonly known as the dwarf buckthorn, is a low-growing shrub native to the western United States. It typically reaches a height of less than 1 meter and has small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by small, dark blue berries in the fall. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or scrubland habitats. Rhamnus depressa is adapted to dry conditions and is considered a characteristic species of the chaparral ecosystem."
