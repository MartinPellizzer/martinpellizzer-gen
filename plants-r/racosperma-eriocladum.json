It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive, feathery leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in dense, globular clusters, which are often visited by a variety of pollinators. Its seeds are enclosed in hard, woody pods and are adapted for dispersal by animals. Racosperma eriocladum is often found in dry, sandy soils and is well-suited to coastal and semi-arid environments."
