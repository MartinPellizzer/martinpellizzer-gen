It is characterized by its slender, arching stems and small, white-tinged bracts that give it its common name. The plant produces aggregate fruits composed of small, red drupes that ripen in late summer. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated margins and a hairy underside. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
