    "intro": "Rosa humilis var. triloba, commonly known as the trilobed shrub rose, is a compact, deciduous shrub native to the United States. It features small, trifoliate leaves that are typically gray-green in color and have a velvety texture. The plant produces fragrant, pale yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. It is well-suited for rock gardens or as a border plant due to its low-growing habit. Rosa humilis var. triloba is relatively drought-tolerant and requires minimal pruning for optimal growth."
