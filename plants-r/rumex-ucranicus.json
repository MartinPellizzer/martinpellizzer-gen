    "intro": "Rumex ucranicus, commonly known as the Crimean sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It features alternate, broadly ovate to lanceolate leaves with a reddish or purple underside, which are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by egg-shaped, reddish-brown fruits. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks. The species is noted for its ornamental value and has been used historically in traditional medicine."
