The plant typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it blooms from late spring to early summer. Ranunculus rubricaulis is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats, where it contributes to the biodiversity of its ecosystem."
