    "intro": "Rhamnus frangula var. longifolia, commonly known as the European buckthorn, is a shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves that are typically elongated and have a distinctive midrib. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by dark purple berries that are rich in anthraquinones. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or hedgerows. Due to its medicinal properties, it has been historically used in traditional medicine for its laxative effects."
