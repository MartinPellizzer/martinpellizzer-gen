    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 mixtus, commonly known as the blackberry-elderberry hybrid, is a botanical hybrid resulting from the cross between Rubus fruticosus (blackberry) and Rubus caesius (elderberry). It exhibits characteristics of both parent species, featuring thorny stems and compound leaves typical of the Rubus genus. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black in color. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its hybrid nature, it may show genetic variability in morphology and fruit quality."
