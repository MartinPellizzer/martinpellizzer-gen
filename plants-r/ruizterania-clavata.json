    "intro": "Ruizterania clavata, commonly known as the clustered liverwort, is a small, non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a thalloid structure with a dorsiventral leafy thallus that is often clustered in dense mats. Its reproductive structures, including male and female gametophytes, are closely arranged on the thallus. Ruizterania clavata plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various invertebrates."
