It belongs to the Polygonaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and reddish stems. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on slender, upright stalks. Its leaves are edible and have a tangy, sour flavor due to the presence of oxalic acid. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas."
