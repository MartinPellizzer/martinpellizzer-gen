    "intro": "Rubus caesius f. armata, commonly known as the bristly blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant characterized by its dense, prickly growth. It is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe, particularly in the Alps. The plant produces small, dark red berries that are typically edible but have a tart flavor. Its foliage is covered in fine hairs, contributing to its bristly appearance. This form is notable for its horticultural interest and adaptability to cooler climates."
