    "intro": "Rubus serpens var. acutisepalus, commonly known as the sharp-sepaled blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to certain regions of South America. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and thorny stems, which help it climb or spread across the ground. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically edible, though they may have a tart flavor. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the flowers are white with five petals. This variety is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
