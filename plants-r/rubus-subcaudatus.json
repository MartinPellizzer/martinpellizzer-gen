It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and produces small, dark purple to black berries. The plant has compound leaves with serrated margins and produces white to pink flowers in the spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The fruit is edible, though it is generally less flavorful compared to other blackberry varieties."
