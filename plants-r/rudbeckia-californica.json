    "intro": "Rudbeckia californica, commonly known as the California coneflower, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It features a basal rosette of lance-shaped, gray-green leaves and produces bright yellow to orange daisy-like flowers with a prominent central cone. The plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it well-suited for dry, rocky habitats. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to ecological diversity. Rudbeckia californica is also valued in native plant gardens for its ornamental appeal and low maintenance requirements."
