    "intro": "Rosa canina f. hypsisepala, commonly known as the tall-stemmed dog rose, is a botanical variant of the common dog rose. It is characterized by its elongated stems and larger, more prominent flowers compared to the typical form. The plant produces pink to pale red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its hips, which are the fruit, are typically smaller and more elongated than those of the standard Rosa canina. This subspecies is often found in open woodlands and scrublands, thriving in well-drained soils."
