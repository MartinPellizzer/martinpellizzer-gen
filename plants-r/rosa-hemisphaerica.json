It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and produces large, showy flowers with a distinctive hemispherical shape. The plant typically blooms in spring, with pink to red flowers that are rich in nectar, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are compound, with serrated edges, and it has a strong, aromatic fragrance. Rosa hemisphaerica is well adapted to cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to thrive."
