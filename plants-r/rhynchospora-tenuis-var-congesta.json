    "intro": "Rhynchospora tenuis var. congesta, commonly known as the narrowleaf spikerush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and other grass-like plants. The plant features slender, grass-like stems with small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a slightly hairy texture. This variety is distinguished by its dense flowering spikes, which give it a more compact appearance compared to other varieties of Rhynchospora."
