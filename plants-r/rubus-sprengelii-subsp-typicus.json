    "intro": "Rubus sprengelii subsp. typicus, commonly known as the Sprengel's blackberry, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and trifoliate leaves, which are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that ripen to a deep black color, often with a slight whitish bloom. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to temperate to cold climates. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and agroforestry systems."
