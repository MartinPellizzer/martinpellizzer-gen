    "intro": "Rubus sachalinensis var. glabrifolius, commonly known as the smooth-leaved blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous foliage, which distinguishes it from other Rubus species. The plant produces aggregate fruits composed of small, dark red to black drupes. It typically grows in moist, shady environments such as forest understories. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for study in plant morphology and ecological adaptation."
