    "intro": "Rebutia steinmannii subsp. brachyantha, commonly known as the rock cactus, is a compact, low-growing cactus native to South America. It features a cylindrical stem with prominent areoles and produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer. The plant is well adapted to arid environments, with spines that provide protection and reduce water loss. Its succulent leaves are modified into spines, and it stores water in its stem for survival. It is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
