It features dense, floating leaves that are typically bright green with a waxy surface, aiding in water retention. The plant produces small, white, four-petaled flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators like bees. It thrives in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Its growth habit makes it suitable for use in water gardens and pond landscapes."
