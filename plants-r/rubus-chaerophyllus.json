    "intro": "Rubus chaerophyllus, commonly known as the alpine raspberry, is a species of bramble native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its erect growth habit and clusters of small, red, edible fruits. The plant produces compound leaves with serrated edges and has thorny stems typical of the Rubus genus. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific environmental requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant."
