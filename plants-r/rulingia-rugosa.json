    "intro": "Rulingia rugosa, commonly known as the roughleaf rulingia, is a shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs, giving them a rough texture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by elongated, woody fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. Due to its unique appearance and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
