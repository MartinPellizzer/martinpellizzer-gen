    "intro": "Ranunculus trichophyllus proles britannicus, commonly known as the British trichophyllous buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe, particularly the British Isles. It is characterized by its delicate, palmate leaves and showy yellow flowers with prominent central sepals. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in woodland edges and meadows. It produces small, greenish-brown achenes as its fruit, which are dispersed by wind. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
