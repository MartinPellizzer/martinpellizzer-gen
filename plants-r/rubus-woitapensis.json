    "intro": "Rubus woitapensis, commonly known as the Woitapensis blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Rubus genus, which includes many species of shrubs with edible berries. The plant is characterized by its thorny stems, trifoliate leaves, and dark purple to black berries that ripen in late summer. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and partial shade. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and less-studied member of the Rubus family."
