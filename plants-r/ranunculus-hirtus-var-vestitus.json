    "intro": "Ranunculus hirtus var. vestitus, commonly known as the hairy crowfoot, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and showy, bright yellow or white flowers with five petals. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges. It is a perennial species that produces small, green, hairy fruits known as achenes. The hairy stem and leaves give it its common name, and it is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens."
