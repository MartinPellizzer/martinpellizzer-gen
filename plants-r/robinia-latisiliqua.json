    "intro": "Robinia latisiliqua, commonly known as the narrow-leaved false acacia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and have a narrow, lance-shaped appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow, pea-like flowers in the spring, followed by pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or along riverbanks. Robinia latisiliqua is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
