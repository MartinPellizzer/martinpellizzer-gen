    "intro": "Rubus petrophiloides, commonly known as the rock raspberry, is a species of bramble native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit and thorny stems, which are typical of the Rubus genus. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are usually red or yellow in color, which are edible but have a tart flavor. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
