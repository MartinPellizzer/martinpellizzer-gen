    "intro": "Rumex haematinus, commonly known as red sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive reddish veins in the leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in the spring. Its leaves are edible and have a tart, sour flavor due to the presence of oxalic acid. Rumex haematinus is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides."
