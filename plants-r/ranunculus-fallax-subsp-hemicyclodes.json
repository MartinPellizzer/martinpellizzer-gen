    "intro": "Ranunculus fallax subsp. hemicyclodes, commonly known as the alpine buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features delicate, yellow flowers with five to seven petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has a basal rosette of lance-shaped, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in mountain meadows and alpine tundra. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species in many regions."
