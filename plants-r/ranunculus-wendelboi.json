    "intro": "Ranunculus wendelboi, commonly known as the Wendelbo's buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high-altitude regions of the European Alps. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family, characterized by its showy, usually yellow or white flowers with numerous petals. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine meadows, thriving in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil. Its leaves are palmately divided, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that disperse its seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
