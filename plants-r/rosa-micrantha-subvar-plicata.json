It is characterized by its distinctive, plicated (folded) leaves and clusters of fragrant, pink to white flowers. The plant typically grows in shady, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its thorny stems and deciduous nature make it well adapted to temperate climates. This subvariety is valued for its ornamental qualities and is cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
