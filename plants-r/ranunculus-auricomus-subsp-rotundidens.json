    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus subsp. rotundidens, commonly known as the round-leaf buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It features showy, bright yellow flowers with five broadly ovate petals, often marked with a central brownish blotch. The subspecies is distinguished by its rounder, more broadly shaped leaves compared to the typical form of *R. auricomus*. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant blooms."
