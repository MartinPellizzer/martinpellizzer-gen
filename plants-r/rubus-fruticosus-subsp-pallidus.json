It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits known as drupes, which are typically red or black when ripe. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including woodlands, hedgerows, and disturbed soils. The subspecies is distinguished by its pale-colored flowers and less robust growth compared to other Rubus species."
