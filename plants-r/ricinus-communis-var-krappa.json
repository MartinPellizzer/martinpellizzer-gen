    "intro": "Ricinus communis var. krappa, commonly known as the crimson cup plant, is a striking ornamental species native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in diameter, often with a distinctive red or purple underside. The plant produces unique, spiky seed capsules that are adorned with red, bristly hairs, giving it an eye-catching appearance. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil, making it suitable for gardens and landscapes. Despite its beauty, it is important to note that all parts of the plant contain toxic compounds, requiring caution during handling."
