    "intro": "Ricinocarpus radicans, commonly known as the climbing ricin tree, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its woody stem and climbing habit, often found in moist, shaded environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by woody, spiny fruits containing toxic seeds. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a rough texture. Due to the presence of ricin, a potent toxin, it is considered dangerous and should be handled with care."
