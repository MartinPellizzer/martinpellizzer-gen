It is characterized by its white to pale pink flowers, which are slightly smaller than those of the typical Rosa canina. The plant produces red, hairy fruits called hips, which are edible and used in culinary and medicinal applications. It is a deciduous shrub that thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland areas. Its botanical features make it a valuable plant for both ornamental and ecological purposes."
