    "intro": "Rosa vosagiaca var. transiens, commonly known as the Transient Rosa, is a rare and delicate species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender stems and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are trifoliate, with finely serrated edges, and the flowers range in color from pale pink to white. Due to its limited habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
