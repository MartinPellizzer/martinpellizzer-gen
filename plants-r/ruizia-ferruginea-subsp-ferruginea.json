    "intro": "Ruizia ferruginea subsp. ferruginea, commonly known as the redwood tree or ironwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, dark bark that resembles iron, hence its common name. The plant has large, glossy, leathery leaves that are arranged in whorls around the stem. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release its seeds."
