    "intro": "Rumex acetosa var. serpenticola, commonly known as snake's tongue grass, is a variant of the common sorrel. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its distinctive, arrowhead-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils and is found in wet meadows, bogs, and along stream banks. Its leaves are edible but contain oxalic acid, which can be toxic in large quantities. The flowers are small and greenish, arranged in dense clusters, and the plant is known for its ornamental value in wetland gardens."
