    "intro": "Rumex maritimus var. ochotskius, commonly known as the Ochotsk dock, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal areas of the Russian Far East and northern Japan. It thrives in saline and brackish environments, often found along tidal flats and estuaries. The plant has broad, arrow-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Its flowers are small and clustered in spikes, producing a distinctive reddish or greenish hue. The species is adapted to withstand harsh maritime conditions, including salt spray and fluctuating water levels."
