    "intro": "Rosa gypsicola, commonly known as the gypsum rose, is a species of flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and profuse flowering, typically producing pink to red flowers. The plant is well adapted to poor, mineral-rich soils, particularly those containing gypsum. Its leaves are usually small, hairy, and arranged in a spiral pattern. Rosa gypsicola is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in harsh environments."
