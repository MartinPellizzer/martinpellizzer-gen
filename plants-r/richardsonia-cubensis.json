    "intro": "Richardsonia cubensis, commonly known as the Cuban cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the Caribbean. It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, feather-like leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is adapted to tropical and subtropical climates. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Richardsonia cubensis is considered endangered and is protected in several countries."
