It is characterized by its striking reddish-brown bark and glossy, dark green leaves that are often revolute, giving it its scientific name. The plant belongs to the family Dipterocarpaceae and is valued for its durable, heavy timber. It thrives in humid, lowland forests and plays a role in the ecological balance of its native habitat. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
