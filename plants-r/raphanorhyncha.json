    "intro": "Raphanorhyncha, commonly known as the horned watercress, is a rare aquatic plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in the summer months. Raphanorhyncha thrives in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams. Its unique horn-like structures on the leaves are thought to aid in water retention and protection from herbivores."
