    "intro": "Rosa \u00d7 centifolia prolifera, commonly known as the centifolia rose, is a hybrid species originating from the cross between Rosa damascena and Rosa gallica. It is characterized by its abundant, fragrant, pink to white flowers that bloom in clusters, making it a prized ornamental plant. The plant is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil. It has a shrub-like growth habit with thorny stems and dark green, glossy foliage. Its botanical significance lies in its historical use in perfumery and its role in the development of many modern rose cultivars."
