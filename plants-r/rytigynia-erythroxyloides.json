    "intro": "Rytigynia erythroxyloides, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Rytigyniaceae and is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and simple, opposite leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by elliptical, woody fruits containing one or two seeds. It is valued for its durable, aromatic wood, which has been historically used in traditional crafts and furniture. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered a threatened species in its natural habitat."
