    "intro": "Rhigozum virgatum, commonly known as the Virginia creeper, is a deciduous vine native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which typically consist of five to seven ovate leaflets arranged oppositely. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, followed by bright red berries that are toxic to humans and livestock. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Rhigozum virgatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting wildlife."
