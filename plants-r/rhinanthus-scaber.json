    "intro": "Rhinanthus scaber, commonly known as rough horseweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, which includes several parasitic and hemiparasitic species. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides, meadows, and grasslands. It produces yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are rough to the touch, giving it its common name, and it is often found in association with other wildflowers in its native environment."
