    "intro": "Renealmia calcarata, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and its ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant features lance-shaped, leathery leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. It produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori, which are typically located on the underside of the leaves. Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in tropical and subtropical gardens."
