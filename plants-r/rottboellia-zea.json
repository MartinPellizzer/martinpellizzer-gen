    "intro": "Rottboellia zea, commonly known as cock\u2019s-comb grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features tall, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces distinctive, feathery inflorescences that resemble a comb. The plant is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions. Its seeds are small and dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to spread easily. Rottboellia zea is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its invasive potential."
