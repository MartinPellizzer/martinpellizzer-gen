    "intro": "Rosa orientalis, commonly known as the Persian rose, is a species of flowering shrub native to the Caucasus region and parts of southern Russia. It is characterized by its fragrant, deep pink to crimson flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has woody stems covered in thorns and produces oval, dark green leaves with serrated edges. Its flowers are often used in perfumery due to their intense, sweet scent. Rosa orientalis is valued both for its ornamental beauty and its historical significance in traditional medicine and floral art."
