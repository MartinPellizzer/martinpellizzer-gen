    "intro": "Rhododendron brachycarpum, commonly known as the dwarf rhododendron, is a species native to the Himalayas and parts of Southeast Asia. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring dense, leathery leaves that are dark green in color. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to purple, which bloom in spring. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its compact size and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for ornamental horticulture."
