    "intro": "Rosa pratensis var. geminata, commonly known as the meadow rose or creeping rose, is a perennial shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often prostrate stems that form dense mats, and its small, fragrant flowers that bloom in pink to white hues. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with five to seven leaflets that are oval to elliptic in shape. The species is known for its ability to spread vegetatively through stolons, making it a persistent and widespread plant in its native range."
