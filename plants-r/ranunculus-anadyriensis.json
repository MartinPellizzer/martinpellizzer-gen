    "intro": "Ranunculus anadyriensis, commonly known as the Anadyr buttercup, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic regions of Russia. It is characterized by its delicate, yellow-orange flowers with five to eight petals and a hairy, branched stem. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky soils along the shores of lakes and rivers. It has small, trifoliate leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its cold, arctic environment. Ranunculus anadyriensis is a herbaceous perennial that blooms in late spring and early summer."
