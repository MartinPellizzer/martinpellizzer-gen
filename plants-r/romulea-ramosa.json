    "intro": "Romulea ramosa, commonly known as the clustered glory-of-the-snow, is a perennial bulbous plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its striking, nodding yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces a cluster of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a basal rosette. Its bulbs are adapted for storing water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. Romulea ramosa is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens with well-drained soil and full sun."
