    "intro": "Rhododendron metternichii var. kyomaruense, commonly known as the Kyomaru rhododendron, is a rare and ornamental evergreen shrub native to Japan. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and clusters of bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in acidic, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its flowers, which range in color from pink to white, bloom in late spring to early summer. Due to its limited natural range and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
