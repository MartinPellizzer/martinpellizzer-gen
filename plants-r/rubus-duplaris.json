    "intro": "Rubus duplaris, commonly known as the twin-fruit raspberry, is a species of bramble native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and the production of small, aggregate fruits that typically appear in pairs on the same receptacle. The plant has trifoliate leaves with serrated edges and produces white to pale yellow flowers during the spring season. Its berries are generally less sweet and more tart compared to other raspberry species, making them suitable for culinary uses in jams and teas. The plant is also valued for its ornamental qualities and its role in supporting local wildlife."
