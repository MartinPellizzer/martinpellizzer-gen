    "intro": "Rubus fruticosus var. cupanianus, commonly known as the brambles or blackberry shrub, is a perennial deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems, trifoliate leaves, and aggregate fruits that develop from multiple ovaria. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by the familiar dark purple or black berries in late summer. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, fertile ground. This species is often found in hedgerows, woodland edges, and disturbed habitats."
