    "intro": "Rabdochloa mucronata, commonly known as the narrowleaf ironwood, is a small evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its woody stems are resistant to fire, making it a hardy species in fire-prone habitats. Rabdochloa mucronata is often found in coastal dunes and sandy soils, where it plays a role in stabilizing dune ecosystems."
