    "intro": "Rhynchospora costaricensis, commonly known as the Costa Rican sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Central America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow leaves. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and other moist habitats, thriving in humid tropical climates. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of many sedges. Rhynchospora costaricensis plays a role in maintaining wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various organisms."
