    "intro": "Rivina polyandra, commonly known as the redroot false nettle, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds. Rivina polyandra is often found in moist, sandy soils along streambanks and in woodland edges."
