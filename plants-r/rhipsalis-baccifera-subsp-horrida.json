    "intro": "Rhipsalis baccifera subsp. horrida, commonly known as the rough rhipsalis, is a species of epiphytic cactus native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its long, slender stems that often hang in cascading clusters, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom during the rainy season, followed by bright red berries that are edible for some animals. Its leaves are reduced to small, hair-like structures, and it lacks true leaves, relying on its stems for photosynthesis. This subspecies is adapted to humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in the understory of forests."
