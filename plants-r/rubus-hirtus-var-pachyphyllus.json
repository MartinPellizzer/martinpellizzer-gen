It is characterized by its large, thick, and leathery leaves, which are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are usually dark purple to black when ripe. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and thickets. Its botanical features make it distinct from other Rubus species, particularly in its foliage and fruit structure."
