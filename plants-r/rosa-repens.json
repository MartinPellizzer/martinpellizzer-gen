    "intro": "Rosa repens, commonly known as trailing rose, is a low-growing shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, horizontal stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink, white, or red, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are compound, consisting of five to seven oval-shaped leaflets, and are covered in fine hairs. Rosa repens is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to cover slopes or walls."
