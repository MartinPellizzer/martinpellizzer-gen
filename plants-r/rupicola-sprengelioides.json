    "intro": "Rupicola sprengelioides, commonly known as the rock cactus, is a species of cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its compact, branching structure and is often found growing on rocky outcrops. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are modified into spines, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Rupicola sprengelioides is well adapted to harsh, dry climates and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
