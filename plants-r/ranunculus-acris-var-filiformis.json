    "intro": "Ranunculus acris var. filiformis, commonly known as the slenderleaf buttercup, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its delicate, yellow flowers with five petals and a hairy, lobed leaf structure. The plant typically grows in moist meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, preferring partial to full sun. Its foliage is often more slender and less lobed compared to the typical Ranunculus acris, giving it a distinct appearance. This variant is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of garden conditions."
