    "intro": "Rhynchospora curtissii, commonly known as the curly grass or narrowleaf beakgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. Its rhizomes form dense colonies, contributing to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Rhynchospora curtissii plays a role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and birds."
