    "intro": "Ranunculus millefolius subsp. hierosolymitanus, commonly known as the Jerusalem crowfoot, is a flowering plant native to the eastern Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its delicate, trifoliate leaves and bright yellow, cup-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in rocky or limestone areas. It has a short growing season and blooms in early spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
