It is characterized by its simple, thornless stems and small, fragrant pink or white flowers. The plant produces oval, greenish-yellow fruits called rosehips, which are rich in vitamin C. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in meadows. Its botanical features make it a common weed in agricultural areas."
