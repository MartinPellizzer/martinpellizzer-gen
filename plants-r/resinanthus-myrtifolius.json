    "intro": "Resinanthus myrtifolius, commonly known as the myrtle-leaved resinanthus, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its aromatic, lance-shaped leaves that resemble those of myrtle species. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by resinous, woody fruits that contain seeds. Its foliage is often used in traditional herbal remedies due to its aromatic properties. The plant's ability to exude resin makes it valuable in both ecological and medicinal contexts."
