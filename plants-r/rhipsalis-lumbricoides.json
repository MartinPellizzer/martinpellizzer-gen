    "intro": "Rhipsalis lumbricoides, commonly known as the earthy cactus, is a climbing cactus native to Brazil. It features wiry, segmented stems that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in winter, followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and ease of care, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
