    "intro": "Rorippa \u00d7 laeta, commonly known as the hybrid watercress, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Rorippa islandica and Rorippa palustris. It is a short-lived perennial herb that typically grows in wet, marshy environments. The plant has small, alternate leaves that are often submerged or floating, with slender, wiry stems. Its flowers are yellow and clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Due to its aquatic habitat, it plays a role in wetland ecosystems by providing food and habitat for various aquatic organisms."
