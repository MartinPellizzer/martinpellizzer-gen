    "intro": "Rhodiola himalensis var. ishidae, commonly known as the Ishida's rhodiola, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Crassulaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, succulent leaves and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky and alpine environments, where it adapts to cold and harsh conditions. It is valued for its medicinal properties, containing compounds such as rosavins and salidrosides, which are believed to have adaptogenic and antioxidant effects. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
