    "intro": "Rosa tomentella, commonly known as the woolly rose, is a shrub native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its dense, grayish-white fuzzy foliage and small, pink or red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces oval, reddish-brown fruits known as hips, which are edible and used in traditional medicine. Rosa tomentella thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
