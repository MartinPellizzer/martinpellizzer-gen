    "intro": "Rebutia steinbachii subsp. verticillacantha, commonly known as the rock cactus or sun cactus, is a compact, low-growing cactus native to South America. It features short, cylindrical stems that are often ribbed and covered in dense, white to pale blue spines. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically borne on short pedicels. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and container cultivation."
