It is native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere, particularly in Europe and parts of Asia. The plant typically grows as a shrub, reaching heights of up to 2 meters, with alternate, pinnately compound leaves. Its flowers are usually pink or white, and the fruit, a cluster of small drupes, ripens in late summer. This species is valued for its edible berries, which are used in culinary and commercial applications."
