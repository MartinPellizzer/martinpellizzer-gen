    "intro": "Rumex bakeri, commonly known as Baker's sorrel, is a flowering plant in the Polygonaceae family. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves with reddish veins and bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Native to the western United States, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread vegetatively. Its leaves are often used in culinary applications, though they contain oxalic acid and should be consumed with caution."
