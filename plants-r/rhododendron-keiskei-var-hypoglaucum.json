    "intro": "Rhododendron keiskei var. hypoglaucum, commonly known as the silverleaf rhododendron, is a compact evergreen shrub native to Japan. It features dense, leathery foliage that is typically silver-gray in color due to a thick layer of epicuticular wax. The plant produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to white, which bloom in early spring. Its leaves are elliptical and have a waxy texture, contributing to its drought tolerance. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its striking appearance and hardy nature."
