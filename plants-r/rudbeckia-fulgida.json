    "intro": "Rudbeckia fulgida, commonly known as the fireweed or potato bush, is a perennial herb native to North America. It features showy yellow to orange flower heads surrounded by bright green, hairy leaves. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its hairy stems and leaves are covered in fine, soft hairs, which help reduce water loss. Rudbeckia fulgida is known for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
