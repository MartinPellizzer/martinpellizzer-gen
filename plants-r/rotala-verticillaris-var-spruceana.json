    "intro": "Rotala verticillaris var. spruceana, commonly known as the Spruce's rotala, is a compact, aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It features whorled leaves that are typically bright green and slightly serrated, which help it thrive in slow-moving freshwater environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often submerged, contributing to its ornamental value in aquariums. It is well-suited for planted tanks due to its ability to tolerate a range of water conditions and light levels. Its dense growth habit also makes it an effective background plant for aquatic landscapes."
