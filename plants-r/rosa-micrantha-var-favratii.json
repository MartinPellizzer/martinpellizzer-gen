    "intro": "Rosa micrantha var. favratii, commonly known as the favratii rose, is a shrub-like species native to the mountainous regions of southeastern Europe. It features slender, thorned stems and is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces rose hips, which are the fruit containing the seeds, and these are often used in traditional herbal remedies. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
