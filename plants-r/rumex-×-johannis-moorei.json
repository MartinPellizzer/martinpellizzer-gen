    "intro": "Rumex \u00d7 johannis-moorei, commonly known as the hybrid sorrel, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Rumex acetosa (common sorrel) and Rumex acetobipennias (broad-leaved sorrel). It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves with a reddish or purple coloration on the veins, which are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, and it is often found in moist, fertile soils in temperate regions. Rumex \u00d7 johannis-moorei is a perennial herb that thrives in partial shade to full sun, and it is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value. Its botanical features make it a notable example of natural hybridization in the Polygonaceae family."
