    "intro": "Rosa livescens var. nemorivaga, commonly known as the woodland rose, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It features slender, arching stems with narrow, serrated leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of grayish-white pubescence. The plant produces fragrant, semi-double flowers in shades of pink to pale red, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it a distinctive and ornamental addition to gardens with suitable conditions."
