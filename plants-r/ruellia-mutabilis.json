    "intro": "Ruellia mutabilis, commonly known as the ever-changing ruellia, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink, violet, and blue, depending on the light conditions. These flowers bloom throughout the growing season, often changing color as they mature, which gives the plant its common name. Ruellia mutabilis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various soil types."
