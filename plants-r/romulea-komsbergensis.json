    "intro": "Romulea komsbergensis, commonly known as the Komsberg sand orchid, is a perennial bulbous plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its compact, grass-like leaves and delicate, bell-shaped flowers. The plant produces a single flower per stem, typically in shades of yellow or orange, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained sandy soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
