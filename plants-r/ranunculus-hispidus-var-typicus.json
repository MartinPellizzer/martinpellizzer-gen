    "intro": "Ranunculus hispidus var. typicus, commonly known as the hairy buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features basal leaves that are palmately lobed and covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces showy yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain environments."
