    "intro": "Rhytidosporum prostratum, commonly known as the prostrate spurge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its stems are prostrate, lying close to the ground, and it often forms dense mats in its natural habitat. Rhytidosporum prostratum is adapted to rocky or sandy soils and is often found in coastal or semi-arid regions."
