    "intro": "Rosa uriensis var. inermis, commonly known as the smooth rose, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It features compound leaves with three to five leaflets, and its stems are typically covered in a soft, fuzzy layer rather than thorns. The plant produces fragrant, single or semi-double pink to white flowers in the spring. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sun, making it a suitable choice for wetland or riparian areas. Its botanical characteristics make it an important species for ecological studies and wetland restoration projects."
