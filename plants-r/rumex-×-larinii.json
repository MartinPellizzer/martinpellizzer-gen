    "intro": "Rumex \u00d7 larinii, commonly known as the hybrid sorrel, is a naturally occurring hybrid between Rumex acetosa (common sorrel) and Rumex acetobipinus (woolly sorrel). It is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its distinctive heart-shaped leaves and reddish veins. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. Its flowers are small and greenish, arranged in clusters, and it produces seeds that are dispersed by wind. The hybrid is notable for its adaptability and is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions."
