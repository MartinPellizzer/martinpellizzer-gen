    "intro": "Rubia tatarica var. grandis, commonly known as the greater cowberry, is a perennial shrub native to eastern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and pairs of opposite leaves that are lance-shaped and often hairy. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, followed by red or black berries that are edible but have a tart flavor. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal medicine."
