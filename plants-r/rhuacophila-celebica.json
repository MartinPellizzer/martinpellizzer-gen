    "intro": "Rhuacophila celebica, commonly known as the Celebes rock orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found in the mountainous regions of Sulawesi, Indonesia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and possesses a pseudobulb with a single leaf. The plant produces striking violet to purple flowers with a distinctive lip that is often adorned with intricate patterns. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is adapted to rocky substrates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat destruction."
