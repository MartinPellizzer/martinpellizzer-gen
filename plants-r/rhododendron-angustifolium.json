    "intro": "Rhododendron angustifolium, commonly known as the coastal rhododendron, is a flowering shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves and clusters of deep pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in moist, coastal environments. It plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for wildlife. Due to its ornamental value, it is also cultivated in gardens across the United States."
