    "intro": "Rubus morganwgensis var. devoniae, commonly known as the Devonshire blackberry, is a rare and endemic species native to the western coast of Wales. It is characterized by its dark purple to black berries, which are typically small and have a tart flavor. The plant is a shrub with thorny stems and trifoliate leaves, typical of the Rubus genus. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in coastal heathland environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
