    "intro": "Robinia crispa, commonly known as the silky locust, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted branches and compound leaves that are pinnately arranged with serrated edges. The plant produces fragrant, yellowish-white flowers in pendulous clusters during the spring, which are followed by flat, dehiscent pods containing several seeds. Its bark is smooth and light gray, becoming fissured with age, and it has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion. Robinia crispa is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed sites."
