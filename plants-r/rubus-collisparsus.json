    "intro": "Rubus collisparsus, commonly known as the smooth-stemmed blackberry, is a species of bramble native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its thorny stems and aggregate fruits that ripen to a dark purple or black color. The plant typically grows in woodlands, thickets, and along stream banks, preferring moist, well-drained soils. Its leaves are alternate, palmately lobed, and have a distinctive serrated edge. The berries are edible, though the plant is often considered invasive in certain regions due to its vigorous growth and ability to spread rapidly."
