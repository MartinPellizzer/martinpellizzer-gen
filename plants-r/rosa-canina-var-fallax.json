It is a deciduous shrub with thorny stems and pinnate leaves, typically found in temperate regions. The flowers are usually smaller and more pale in color compared to the standard Rosa canina. Its fruits, known as hips, are similar to those of the common dog rose but may show slight variations in size and color. This variety is often valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in herbal medicine."
