    "intro": "Rosa alpina var. sorbinella, commonly known as the Alpine rose or alpine rock rose, is a perennial shrub native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces clusters of fragrant, pink to white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in full sun. Its leaves are dark green, simple, and arranged alternately along the stems. This variety is well adapted to cold climates and is often used in rock gardens due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
