    "intro": "Resupinaria, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are characterized by their unique growth habit, often growing in a resupinate position, where the stem is curled downward. They are typically found in rocky or mountainous habitats, thriving in well-drained soils. Resupinaria species produce small, intricate flowers that are often brightly colored, attracting specific pollinators. Due to their specialized habitats, many species are rare and face conservation challenges."
