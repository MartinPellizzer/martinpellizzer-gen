It features a short, thick stem with prominent areoles, from which both spines and flowers emerge. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its foliage is typically green, though it may turn reddish under intense sunlight. This cultivar is prized for its striking color contrast and is well-suited for rock gardens or as a container plant."
