    "intro": "Rytigynia uhligii, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rhamnaceae. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its small, fragrant yellow flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with dark green, lance-shaped leaves. It is valued for its hard, dark wood, which has been historically used in musical instruments. However, due to overharvesting, it is now considered a threatened species."
