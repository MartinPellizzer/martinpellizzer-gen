The plant produces small, spikelet-based flowers that are typically greenish or brownish in color. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Roegneria pendulina is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing slopes and providing habitat for small wildlife."
