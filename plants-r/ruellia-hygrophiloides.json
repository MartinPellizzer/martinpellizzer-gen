It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often near streams or in swampy areas. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of blue or purple tubular flowers. Its root system is adapted to waterlogged soils, allowing it to thrive in aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats. Ruellia hygrophiloides is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
