    "intro": "Reseda platystachya, commonly known as plains reseda, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of North America. It is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Reseda platystachya is often found in sandy or gravelly soils along dry stream beds and roadsides."
