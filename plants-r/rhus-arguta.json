    "intro": "Rhus arguta, commonly known as the smooth sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern and central United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and turn vibrant red in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in panicles, followed by red, fuzzy berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds. Rhus arguta thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in open woodlands, along roadsides, and in disturbed soils. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it an important component of ecological succession in various habitats."
