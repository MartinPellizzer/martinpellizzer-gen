    "intro": "Rhamnus globulariifolia, commonly known as the globe willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its spherical growth habit, with dense, rounded clusters of small, oval leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by orange to red berries that are an important food source for birds. Its compact form and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice for landscaping. The species is also valued for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its tolerance to urban conditions."
