    "intro": "Rhamnidium, commonly known as the African flame tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Fabaceae. These plants are native to Africa and are characterized by their showy, often red or orange flowers that bloom in clusters. The leaves are typically bipinnate, meaning they are divided into small, feather-like segments. Rhamnidium species are often used in ornamental gardening due to their striking appearance and ability to thrive in tropical and subtropical climates. They also play a role in local ecosystems by providing food and habitat for various wildlife."
