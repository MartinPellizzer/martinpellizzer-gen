    "intro": "Rhododendron campanulatum var. amabile, commonly known as the bell-shaped rhododendron, is a flowering shrub native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of bell-shaped, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. The leaves are typically dark green, leathery, and elliptical in shape, providing a striking contrast to the blooms. This variety thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its fragrant flowers and evergreen foliage."
