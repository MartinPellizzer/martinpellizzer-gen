    "intro": "Ranunculus marmarosiensis, commonly known as the marblecup buttercup, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It features delicate, cup-shaped flowers with white petals and a yellow center, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has finely divided, trifoliate leaves that are often covered in a soft, velvety texture. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded woodland areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
