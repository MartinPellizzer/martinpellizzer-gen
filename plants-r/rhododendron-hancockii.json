    "intro": "Rhododendron hancockii, commonly known as the Hancock rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan, China. It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its dense, leathery leaves and clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing vibrant pink to purple flowers that attract pollinators. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and requires partial to full shade for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value and limited natural range, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and specialized horticultural settings."
