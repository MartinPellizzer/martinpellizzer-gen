    "intro": "Rathbunia gummosa, commonly known as the sticky gum tree, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and small, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by fleshy, berry-like fruits. Rathbunia gummosa is known for its ability to exude a sticky resin, which gives it its common name. It is often found in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments."
