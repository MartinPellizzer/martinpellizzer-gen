    "intro": "Rhinanthus alectorolophus var. pumilus, commonly known as the dwarf yellow rattle, is a flowering plant native to the UK. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, characterized by its parasitic nature and lack of chlorophyll. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom from June to August, typically in grassland habitats. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and it plays a role in promoting soil nitrogen levels through its association with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. This variety is distinguished by its smaller size compared to other yellow rattle species."
