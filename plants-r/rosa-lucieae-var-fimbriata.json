    "intro": "Rosa lucieae var. fimbriata, commonly known as the Fimbriate Lady's Blush, is a rare and ornamental rose species native to specific regions of South America. It features delicate, semi-double flowers with a distinctive fringed appearance along the edges of its petals. The plant typically grows as a shrub with thorny stems and dark green, serrated leaves. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, requiring moderate watering. Due to its limited distribution and unique floral characteristics, it is highly valued in botanical gardens and conservation efforts."
