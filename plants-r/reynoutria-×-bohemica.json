    "intro": "Reynoutria \u00d7 bohemica, commonly known as giant knotweed, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between *Reynoutria japonica* (Japanese knotweed) and *Reynoutria \u00d7 giraldii* (another hybrid species). It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its thick, rhizomatous root system and rapidly spreading growth habit. The plant features heart-shaped, reddish-veined leaves that are typically large, often exceeding 10 cm in length. It produces small, pale green to reddish flowers in clusters during the summer months. Due to its aggressive growth and invasive nature, it is considered a significant ecological and agricultural weed in many regions."
