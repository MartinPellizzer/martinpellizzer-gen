It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and hairy stems. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers, which bloom in spring. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a distinctive three-lobed shape. Rinzia triplex is typically found in heathlands and sandy soils, and it plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
