    "intro": "Rensonia salvadorica, commonly known as the Salvadorian balsa, is a tropical tree native to Central America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers. The plant produces woody capsules that contain numerous small, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland tropical forests. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
