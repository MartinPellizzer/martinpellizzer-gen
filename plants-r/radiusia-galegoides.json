    "intro": "Radiusia galegoides, commonly known as the narrowleaf lupine, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant has compound leaves with numerous small leaflets, and it is adapted to grow in well-drained, often rocky soils. It plays an important role in nitrogen fixation, enriching the soil with nutrients. Radiusia galegoides is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is used in ecological restoration projects."
