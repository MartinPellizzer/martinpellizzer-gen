    "intro": "Rhizophora polandra, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a tropical tree species native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its prop roots, which help stabilize the tree in waterlogged soil and facilitate gas exchange. The plant produces small, reddish flowers that are pollinated by insects and birds. Its seeds are dispersed by water, allowing it to colonize tidal mudflats and estuaries. Rhizophora polandra plays a vital role in coastal ecosystems by preventing erosion and providing habitat for marine and terrestrial organisms."
