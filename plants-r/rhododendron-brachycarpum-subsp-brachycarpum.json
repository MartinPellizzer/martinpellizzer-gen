    "intro": "Rhododendron brachycarpum subsp. brachycarpum, commonly known as the dwarf rhododendron, is a compact evergreen shrub native to the Himalayas. It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring dense, leathery leaves that are dark green and glossy. The plant produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to red, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to form thickets, providing both aesthetic appeal and habitat for small wildlife."
