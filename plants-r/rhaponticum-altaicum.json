    "intro": "Rhaponticum altaicum, commonly known as the Siberian rhubarb, is a perennial plant native to the cold climates of Siberia and northern Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and tall, reddish stems that bear yellow flowers in the summer. The plant is known for its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Its leaves are edible, though they contain oxalic acid and should be cooked before consumption. The plant is also valued for its medicinal properties, traditionally used in herbal remedies."
