    "intro": "Ricinocarpus ellipticus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sycamore, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elongated, elliptical leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by woody, spiny fruits that contain toxic seeds. Its bark is thick and often fissured, providing a distinctive appearance. Ricinocarpus ellipticus is valued for its hard wood and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
