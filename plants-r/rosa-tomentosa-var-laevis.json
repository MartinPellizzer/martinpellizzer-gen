    "intro": "Rosa tomentosa var. laevis, commonly known as the soft-haired rose, is a shrub-like plant native to parts of Asia, including China and Japan. It is characterized by its densely hairy, gray-green foliage and clusters of fragrant, pink to white flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 1\u20132 meters and thrives in well-drained soil with partial to full sun. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The variety laevis differs from the typical Rosa tomentosa by having smoother, less hairy leaves."
