    "intro": "Rosa canina f. eriostyloides, commonly known as the hairy-stemmed dog rose, is a botanical variant of the dog rose species. It is characterized by its hairy stems and smaller, more delicate flowers compared to the typical Rosa canina. The plant is native to parts of Europe and is often found in woodland edges and scrublands. Its leaves are compound, with five to seven leaflets, and it produces rosehips that are typically red or orange in color. This form is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphological traits and potential ecological adaptations."
