It typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that are often slightly hairy, especially along the nodes. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a smooth surface and a tendency to curl at the edges. Rhynchelythrum brevipilum produces small, clustered flowers that are usually greenish or brownish in color, typical of the Cyperaceae family."
