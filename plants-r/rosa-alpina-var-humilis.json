    "intro": "Rosa alpina var. humilis, commonly known as the alpine rose, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features upright, woody stems with small, lance-shaped leaves that are hairy beneath. The plant produces fragrant, pink to white flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens with cold climates."
