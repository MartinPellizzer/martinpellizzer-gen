    "intro": "Rhamnus psilocarpa, commonly known as the red-barked buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-barked trunk and opposite, oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in the spring, followed by dark blue, fleshy berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and rocky areas. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
