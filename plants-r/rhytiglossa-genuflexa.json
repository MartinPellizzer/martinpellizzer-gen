    "intro": "Rhytiglossa genuflexa, commonly known as the bent-lip orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, slender stems and small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rainforests, where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its leaves are elongated and often covered in fine, hairy structures that help retain moisture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Rhytiglossa genuflexa is considered a conservation concern."
