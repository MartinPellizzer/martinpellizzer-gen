    "intro": "Rosa tomentosa var. subglobosa, commonly known as the woolly rose or subglobular rose, is a deciduous shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, white to pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features thorny stems covered in a woolly, grayish pubescence, which helps to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets that are also covered in a fine layer of hair. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to a range of soil types."
