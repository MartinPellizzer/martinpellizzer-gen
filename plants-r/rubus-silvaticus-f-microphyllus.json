    "intro": "Rubus silvaticus f. microphyllus, commonly known as the dwarf bramble, is a shrub characterized by its small, leathery leaves and thorny stems. It is a variant of the common bramble, distinguished by its reduced leaf size and compact growth habit. This plant typically thrives in woodland edges and shaded areas, where it forms dense thickets. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, appearing in clusters, and it produces small, edible berries. The botanical features of this form make it an important component of understory vegetation in temperate forests."
