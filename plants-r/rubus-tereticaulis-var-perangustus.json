    "intro": "Rubus tereticaulis var. perangustus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to certain regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, pointed leaves and small, dark purple berries that ripen in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its stems are thorny, and it produces compound inflorescences with white or pale pink flowers. The botanical features of this variety make it distinct from other Rubus species, particularly in its leaf morphology and fruit size."
