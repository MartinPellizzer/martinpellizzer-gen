    "intro": "Rubus pedunculatus, commonly known as the creeping raspberry, is a species of bramble native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and thorny stems, which help it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or yellow when ripe, often used in local foraging. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant plays an important role in supporting local wildlife, providing food for birds and insects."
