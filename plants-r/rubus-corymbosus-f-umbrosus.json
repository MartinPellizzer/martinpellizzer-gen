It is characterized by its smaller, more delicate leaves and clusters of small, dark red berries. This form typically thrives in shaded environments, making it well-suited for woodland gardens. The plant produces a distinctive, aromatic fragrance, particularly when the berries are mature. Its botanical features make it a unique addition to horticultural collections and ecological studies."
