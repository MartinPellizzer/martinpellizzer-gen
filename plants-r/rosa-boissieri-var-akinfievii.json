    "intro": "Rosa boissieri var. akinfievii, commonly known as the Akinfeevii rose, is a rare and ornamental shrub native to the Caucasus region. It features fragrant, semi-double pink flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has dark green, serrated leaves and produces red-orange hips in late autumn. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a valuable species for botanical collections and conservation efforts."
