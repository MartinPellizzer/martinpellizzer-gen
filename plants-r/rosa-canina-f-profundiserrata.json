It is characterized by its deeply lobed leaves and distinctive, fragrant flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant is native to Europe and parts of western Asia, thriving in temperate climates. Its thorny stems and showy pink or white petals make it a notable ornamental plant. The fruit, known as a hip, is a characteristic feature that develops after the flowers fade."
