    "intro": "Rubus tassinensis, commonly known as the Tassin's blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves, typical of the Rubus genus. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are edible and have a tart flavor. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodlands and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
