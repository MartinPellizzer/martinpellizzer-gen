    "intro": "Rosa hirtidinota var. orbiculatula, commonly known as the woolly rose, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, glandular hairs that give it a fuzzy appearance, particularly on the stems and leaves. The leaves are typically oval to round in shape, with a serrated margin, and are arranged alternately along the stems. Its flowers are usually pink or red, with five petals and numerous stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardy nature in cooler climates."
