    "intro": "Rosa tomentosa subsp. lepidinula, commonly known as the woolly rose or the silvery-leafed rose, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, grayish-white pubescence that covers its stems and leaves, giving it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant produces fragrant, pink to red flowers in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically oval to elliptical, with a leathery texture and a slightly serrated margin. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal and hardiness."
