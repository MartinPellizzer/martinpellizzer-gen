    "intro": "Ricinocarpus sidifolius, commonly known as the sea hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Indo-Pacific. It is characterized by its succulent, waxy leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, adapted to withstand salty air and coastal conditions. The plant produces showy yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in summer. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Ricinocarpus sidifolius is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued for its ornamental appeal."
