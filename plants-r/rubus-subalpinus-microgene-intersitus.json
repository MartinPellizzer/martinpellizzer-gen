    "intro": "Rubus subalpinus microgene intersitus, commonly known as the Alpine blackberry, is a shrub native to high-altitude regions of the European Alps. It is characterized by its prickly stems and clusters of small, dark berries that ripen in late summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, mountainous climates. Its leaves are typically trifoliate, with serrated edges, and its flowers are white or pale pink. This species plays an important role in alpine ecosystems, providing food for wildlife and stabilizing soil in harsh environments."
