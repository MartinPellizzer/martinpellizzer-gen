    "intro": "Rubus subornatus, commonly known as the small-fruited blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically less than 1 cm in diameter. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and partial sunlight. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species in its native habitat."
