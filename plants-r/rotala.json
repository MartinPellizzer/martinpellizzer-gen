    "intro": "Rotala, commonly known as water lettuce, is a floating aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It has rosette-shaped leaves that are coated in a waxy layer, which helps it float on the water's surface. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white in color. Rotala is often used in ornamental ponds and water gardens for its aesthetic appeal and ability to provide habitat for aquatic life. It thrives in shallow, still waters with moderate to high light exposure."
