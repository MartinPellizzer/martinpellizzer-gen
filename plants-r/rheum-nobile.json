    "intro": "Rheum nobile, commonly known as the noble rhubarb, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Polygonaceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and tall, reddish stems. The plant produces showy, panicle-like inflorescences with small, greenish-white flowers. Its leaves are edible, though they contain high levels of oxalic acid, making them toxic if consumed raw. Rheum nobile is often cultivated for its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine."
