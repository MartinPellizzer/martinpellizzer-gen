    "intro": "Rhaphidorhynchus lepidotus, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers that are typically clustered in terminal panicles. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and agricultural fields. Due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in various conditions, it is considered an invasive species in some areas."
