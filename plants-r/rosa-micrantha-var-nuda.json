    "intro": "Rosa micrantha var. nuda, commonly known as the naked-stemmed rose, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often hairless stems and small, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white to pale pink. The plant produces rose hips that are reddish-orange and contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or woodland borders. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance and historical significance in horticulture."
