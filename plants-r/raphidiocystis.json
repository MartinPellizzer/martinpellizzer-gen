    "intro": "Raphidiocystis, commonly known as the stellate algae, is a genus of marine algae belonging to the family Raphidiocystaceae. It is characterized by its unique cellular structure, featuring prominent cytoplasmic inclusions called raphidia. These algae are typically found in shallow coastal waters and are often associated with rocky substrates. The genus includes several species that are important in marine ecosystems due to their role in primary production. Raphidiocystis is also notable for its ability to form dense colonies, which can influence local biodiversity and habitat structure."
