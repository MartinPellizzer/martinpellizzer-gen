    "intro": "Reynoutria lichiangensis, commonly known as the Yunnan arrowhead, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan, China. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae and is characterized by its arrowhead-shaped leaves and flowering stems that bear small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks and in forest understories. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties. Reynoutria lichiangensis is also noted for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
