    "intro": "Rosa \u00d7 atlantica, commonly known as the Atlantic rose, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Rosa rugosa and Rosa bracteata. It is native to the coastal regions of the eastern United States and western Europe, where it thrives in sandy, well-drained soils. The plant is characterized by its rugged, shrub-like form, with thorny stems and dark green, oval-shaped leaves. Its flowers are typically pink to red, appearing in clusters and blooming in late summer to early autumn. Rosa \u00d7 atlantica is valued for its hardiness, adaptability, and ability to stabilize dunes and prevent erosion in coastal environments."
