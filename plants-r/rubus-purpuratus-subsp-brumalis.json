    "intro": "Rubus purpuratus subsp. brumalis, commonly known as the winter raspberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its biennial growth habit, with flowering occurring in late autumn and fruiting in early spring. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or orange in color, which are edible and have a tart flavor. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas or along streambanks. Due to its unique blooming and fruiting cycles, it plays an important ecological role in supporting pollinators and wildlife during the colder months."
