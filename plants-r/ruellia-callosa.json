    "intro": "Ruellia callosa, commonly known as the wooly ruellia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its hairy, or pubescent, stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, rugged appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple, typically blooming in the summer months. Ruellia callosa thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or swampy areas. Its foliage and floral structure make it an attractive addition to native plant gardens."
