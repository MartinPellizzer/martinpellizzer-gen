    "intro": "Rhus ovata var. traskiae, commonly known as the Trask's poison oak, is a variant of the poison oak species native to the western United States. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in coastal and mountainous regions, characterized by its dense, lobed leaves that are often arranged in clusters. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by clusters of fuzzy, red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It is important to note that all parts of this plant contain urushiol, a potent allergen that can cause severe skin irritation. Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided or controlled in natural and managed landscapes."
