    "intro": "Rubus pauciflorus, commonly known as the few-flowered blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the western United States. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves, typical of the Rubus genus. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black in color. It thrives in woodland and shrubland habitats, often in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
