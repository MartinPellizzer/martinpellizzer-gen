    "intro": "Ranunculus yesoensis, commonly known as the Yessoan buttercup, is a perennial herb native to the Korean Peninsula and parts of northeastern China. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream sides. The plant features delicate, palmately divided leaves and produces showy, yellow or white flowers with five to seven petals. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family, known for its often toxic compounds. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
