    "intro": "Rubus serpens var. oreades, commonly known as the mountain blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at higher elevations. The plant produces small, dark berries that are often used in local cuisines and traditional medicine. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it has thorny stems that help it cling to rocky surfaces. The species is valued for its hardiness and ability to thrive in harsh alpine environments."
