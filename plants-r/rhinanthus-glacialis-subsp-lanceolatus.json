    "intro": "Rhinanthus glacialis subsp. lanceolatus, commonly known as the Alpine yellow rattle, is a flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of Europe. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and bright yellow flowers. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. It typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in many areas."
