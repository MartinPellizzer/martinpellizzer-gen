    "intro": "Rhinanthus ramosus, commonly known as the common yellow rattle, is a flowering plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant is characterized by its bright yellow flowers, which bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands, heaths, and along roadsides. Rhinanthus ramosus plays an important role in supporting pollinators and is a key indicator species for biodiverse habitats."
