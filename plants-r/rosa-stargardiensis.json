    "intro": "Rosa stargardiensis, commonly known as the Star-gard rose, is a rare and ancient species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, often with a star-like pattern on the petals. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in temperate climates with cool summers and cold winters. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, edible hips similar to other rose species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Rosa stargardiensis is considered a botanical curiosity and a subject of interest in conservation efforts."
