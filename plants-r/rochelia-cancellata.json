    "intro": "Rochelia cancellata, commonly known as the lace fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are divided into numerous narrow segments, giving it a finely textured appearance. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and streams, where it attaches to submerged surfaces. Its rhizomes are often covered in a distinctive pattern of small, raised bumps, which contribute to its common name. Rochelia cancellata plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to water quality through its filtration abilities."
