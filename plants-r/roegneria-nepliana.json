    "intro": "Roegneria nepliana, commonly known as the Siberian wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the cold climates of Siberia and northern Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous slender spikelets, each containing a single floret. Roegneria nepliana is adapted to harsh environments, exhibiting frost tolerance and the ability to thrive in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils. Its botanical features make it a hardy plant often used in ecological restoration projects in arctic and alpine regions."
