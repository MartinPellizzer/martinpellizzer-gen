    "intro": "Ricinocarpus erythrostachyus, commonly known as the red-stemmed ricin tree, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive red-colored stems and palmate leaves. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers, followed by woody fruits containing toxic seeds. It is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, growing in moist, well-drained soils. Due to the presence of ricin, a potent toxin, it is considered hazardous and should be handled with care."
