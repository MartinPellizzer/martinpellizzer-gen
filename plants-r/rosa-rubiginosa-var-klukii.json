It features dense, evergreen foliage with dark green, leathery leaves that are oval in shape. The plant produces fragrant, pale pink to white flowers in late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a rounded, red to orange hip that contains achenes, which are dispersed by wind. This variety is well adapted to coastal climates and is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and ornamental value."
