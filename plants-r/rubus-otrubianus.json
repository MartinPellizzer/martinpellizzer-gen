    "intro": "Rubus otrubianus, commonly known as the Otrubian bramble, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves, typical of many bramble species. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits known as drupes, which are usually red or black in color. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
