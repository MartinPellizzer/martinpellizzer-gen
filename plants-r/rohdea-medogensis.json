    "intro": "Rohdea medogensis, commonly known as the Tibetan lily, is a rare and endangered plant native to the high-altitude regions of China. It is a herbaceous perennial that produces striking, sword-shaped leaves with a distinctive blue-green hue. The plant's flowers are small and white, arranged in a loose cluster, and bloom in late summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its mountainous habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat destruction, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to survive."
