It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and dark green, leathery leaves that remain on the plant year-round. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers in clusters, which are followed by black, edible berries. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodland edges and thickets. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
