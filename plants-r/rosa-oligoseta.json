    "intro": "Rosa oligoseta, commonly known as the alpine rose, is a species of flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a low-growing shrub that typically reaches a height of 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant features dense, upright stems covered in short, hooked prickles, and its leaves are composed of five to seven elliptical leaflets. It produces clusters of small, pale pink to white flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, fuzzy fruits called achenes. Rosa oligoseta is well adapted to harsh alpine environments, with a deep root system and a compact growth form that helps it withstand strong winds and cold temperatures."
