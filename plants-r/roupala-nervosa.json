    "intro": "Roupala nervosa, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are typically green on the upper surface and velvety underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruit is a small, round drupe that splits open to release its seeds. Roupala nervosa is often found in moist, shaded environments and is sometimes considered an invasive species in regions outside its native range."
