    "intro": "Roepera pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf roepera, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of its family. Roepera pygmaea thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded, rocky habitats. Due to its delicate nature, it is relatively rare and requires specific care to cultivate successfully."
