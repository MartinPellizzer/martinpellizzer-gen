It features slender, arching stems that often grow along the ground, covered in small, dark green leaves. The plant produces fragrant, pink to red flowers in late spring to early summer. Its botanical characteristics include simple, pinnately compound leaves and numerous thorns along the stems. Rosa setigera is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping for its cascading growth habit."
