    "intro": "Rubus hrubyi, commonly known as Hruby's blackberry, is a species of brambles native to the mountainous regions of central Mexico. It is characterized by its thorny stems and aggregate fruits that develop from multiple small drupelets. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and thrives in full sun. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and its flowers are white with five petals. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Rubus hrubyi is considered a rare and poorly studied species."
