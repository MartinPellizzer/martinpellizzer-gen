    "intro": "Rumex bucephalophorus subsp. hispanicus, commonly known as Spanish dock, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and northern Africa. It typically grows in moist soils along riverbanks, marshes, and wet meadows. The plant features alternate, lance-shaped leaves with prominent veins and reddish veins, and it produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in spring. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense stands. The species is notable for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally in herbal remedies."
