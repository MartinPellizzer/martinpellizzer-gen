    "intro": "Rhus rubifolia, commonly known as the staghorn sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically arranged in pairs along the stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in cone-like clusters, followed by red, fuzzy berries that are a distinctive feature. Its bark is thick and rugged, giving it a staghorn appearance, and it thrives in full sun to partial shade. Rhus rubifolia is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in various soil conditions."
