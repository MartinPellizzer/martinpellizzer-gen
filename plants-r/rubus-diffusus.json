    "intro": "Rubus diffusus, commonly known as the trailing blackberry, is a species of bramble native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit, with thorny stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, aggregated fruits that ripen to a dark purple or black color, typically in late summer. Its leaves are compound, with three to five leaflets, and are covered in fine, soft hairs. Rubus diffusus is often found in woodland edges, disturbed soils, and along streambanks, where it thrives in partial shade to full sun."
