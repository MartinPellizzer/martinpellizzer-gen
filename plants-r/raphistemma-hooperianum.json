It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes a wide variety of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and leathery, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is typically found in lowland forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
