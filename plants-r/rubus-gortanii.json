    "intro": "Rubus gortanii, commonly known as the Gortan bramble, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or black in color. It thrives in rocky and well-drained soils, often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native range."
