It features slender, upright stems that are often covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically blue or purple in color, which bloom in the summer months. Radamaea montana is adapted to cold, rocky environments and thrives in well-drained soils. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in alpine gardens."
