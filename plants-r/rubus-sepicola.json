    "intro": "Rubus sepicola, commonly known as the coastal blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and small, dark purple to black berries. The plant thrives in coastal environments, often growing in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. Its leaves are typically trifoliate, with a serrated edge, and it produces white or pale pink flowers in the spring. Rubus sepicola plays an important ecological role by providing food for wildlife and stabilizing coastal dunes."
