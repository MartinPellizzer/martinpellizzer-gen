    "intro": "Rumohra aspidioides, commonly known as the cliff fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern coast of Australia. It is characterized by its erect, slender stems and pinnately compound leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in rocky or coastal environments, where it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the leaves and are protected by a kidney-shaped indusium. This fern is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
