It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils near water bodies such as streams, ditches, and wet meadows. The plant has alternate, ovate leaves that are usually submerged or floating, with a peppery, aromatic flavor. Its small white flowers are borne in clusters and bloom from June to August. Rorippa atlantica is often used in salads and has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its purported health benefits."
