    "intro": "Rhododendron rosmarinifolium var. narcissiflorum, commonly known as the sweetbox or winter sweet, is a compact evergreen shrub native to China. It is characterized by its aromatic, needle-like leaves that emit a pleasant fragrance, especially when crushed. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of white to pink, often blooming in late winter or early spring. Its dense, upright growth habit makes it suitable for use as a hedge or in rock gardens. The variety is noted for its cold hardiness and ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments."
