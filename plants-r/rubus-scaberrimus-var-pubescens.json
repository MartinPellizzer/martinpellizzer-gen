    "intro": "Rubus scaberrimus var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy bramble, is a variant of the brambles found in temperate regions. It is characterized by its rough, hairy stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits known as drupes, typically red or black in color. It thrives in woodland edges and disturbed soils, often forming dense thickets. Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and somewhat challenging to manage in gardens."
