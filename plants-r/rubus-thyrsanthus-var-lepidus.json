    "intro": "Rubus thyrsanthus var. lepidus, commonly known as the velvetleaf blackberry, is a species of bramble native to South America. It is characterized by its dark purple to black berries, which are often covered in a fine, velvety bloom. The plant has compound leaves with serrated edges and produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in moist, shaded areas. The fruit is edible but has a tart flavor, making it a popular choice for jams and preserves."
