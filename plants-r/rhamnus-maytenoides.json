    "intro": "Rhamnus maytenoides, commonly known as the Brazilian buckthorn, is a shrub or small tree native to South America. It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its small, simple leaves that are often arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, leathery fruits. It is typically found in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and along stream banks. The plant has a dense root system that helps prevent soil erosion, making it ecologically significant in its native range."
