It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white. The plant has elliptical, dark green leaves with a slightly serrated margin. It prefers well-drained soils and is adapted to temperate climates with distinct seasonal changes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
