    "intro": "Rumex bucephalophorus f. stenocarpus, commonly known as the narrow-carpel dock, is a variant of the broad-leaved dock species. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its upright growth habit and distinctive, lobed leaves. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are typically borne on slender stalks. Its leaves are usually covered in a fine layer of pubescence, giving them a fuzzy texture. This subspecies is often found in moist, calcareous soils in woodland or grassland habitats."
