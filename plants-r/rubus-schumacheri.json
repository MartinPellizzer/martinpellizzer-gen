    "intro": "Rubus schumacheri, commonly known as Schumacher's blackberry, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central America and is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves. The plant produces aggregate fruits that develop from multiple ovaries, forming a cluster of small, dark berries. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and for local consumption."
