    "intro": "Rubus tereticaulis var. porphyrogynus, commonly known as the purple-fruited blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant characterized by its distinctive purple or reddish fruit. It is native to the western United States, particularly California, and thrives in coastal and inland regions with mild climates. The plant is a shrub with thorny stems and compound leaves, typical of the Rubus genus. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, and the fruit develops from the fertilized flower, ripening to a deep purple or black color. The botanical features of this variant make it a unique and valuable species in both ecological and horticultural contexts."
