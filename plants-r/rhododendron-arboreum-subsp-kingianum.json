    "intro": "Rhododendron arboreum subsp. kingianum, commonly known as the Nepal rhododendron, is a species native to the Himalayan regions of Nepal, India, and Bhutan. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows at high altitudes, often in moist, shaded forest environments. The plant is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range in color from pink to red, and its lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of hairs. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for various wildlife species. Due to its ornamental value, it is also cultivated in botanical gardens and as a landscape plant in suitable climates."
