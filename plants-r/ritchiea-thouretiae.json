    "intro": "Ritchiea thouretiae, commonly known as the Hainan cycad, is a rare cycad species native to the Chinese province of Hainan. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnate leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is typically found in lowland rainforests. Due to habitat loss and overcollection, it is considered endangered and is protected in its native range."
