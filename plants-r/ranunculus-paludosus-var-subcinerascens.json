    "intro": "Ranunculus paludosus var. subcinerascens, commonly known as the brownish sandwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to wetland and marshy habitats in Europe. It features delicate, nodding flowers with five sepals that are usually pale yellow to brownish in color. The plant has slender, hairy stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in areas with standing water or saturated ground. This variety is distinguished by its darker, more subdued flower color compared to other Ranunculus species."
