    "intro": "Rubus hirtus subsp. tenuidentatus, commonly known as the slender-leaved blackberry, is a shrub native to parts of Asia, including China and Japan. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. The plant features compound leaves with serrated edges and produces small, aggregate fruits that are usually dark purple to black in color. Its flowers are white to pale pink and are followed by the characteristic bracteate fruits. The subspecies is distinguished by its slender leaflets and relatively smaller, more delicate fruit structure compared to other Rubus species."
