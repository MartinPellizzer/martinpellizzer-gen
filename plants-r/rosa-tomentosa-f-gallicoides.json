    "intro": "Rosa tomentosa f. gallicoides, commonly known as the French gallic rose, is a compact, shrub-like plant native to the Pyrenees region. It features dense, grayish-white fuzzy foliage that gives it a distinctive, almost woolly appearance. The plant produces small, single or semi-double pink flowers with a subtle fragrance, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its growth habit is low and spreading, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. The leaves are typically oval-shaped with a serrated margin and remain evergreen throughout the year."
