It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and related grass-like plants. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, forming dense clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are clustered in spikelets, which are characteristic of the sedge family. Rhynchospora depauperata plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
