    "intro": "Rubus idaeus subsp. maritimus, commonly known as the coastal raspberry, is a subspecies of the red raspberry that thrives in coastal environments. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and small, hairy leaves that help it withstand salty air and wind. The plant produces small, red berries that are typically less flavorful than those of the common raspberry. It is often found in dunes and other coastal habitats where it plays a role in stabilizing sand and preventing erosion. Due to its hardy nature, it is well adapted to the harsh conditions of maritime climates."
