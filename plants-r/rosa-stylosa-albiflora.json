It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has pinnately compound leaves with serrated edges and produces reddish-orange hips in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in woodland edges and open areas.
