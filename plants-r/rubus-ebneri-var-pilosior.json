    "intro": "Rubus ebneri var. pilosior, commonly known as the hairy bramble, is a variant of the bramble genus Rubus. It is a shrub characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregated fruits known as drupes, which are typically red or black in color. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils. Its hairy texture, particularly on the stems and leaves, is a distinguishing feature of this variety."
