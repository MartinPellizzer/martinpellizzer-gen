It is characterized by its arching, thorned stems that often trail along the ground, giving it a serpentine appearance. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or orange in color, appearing in late summer. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three leaflets that are serrated and have a slightly hairy texture. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or wetland habitats."
