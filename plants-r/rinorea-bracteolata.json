    "intro": "Rinorea bracteolata, commonly known as the velvetleaf rinorea, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically followed by egg-shaped, woody fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Rinorea bracteolata is valued for its ornamental appeal and has some traditional uses in local medicine."
