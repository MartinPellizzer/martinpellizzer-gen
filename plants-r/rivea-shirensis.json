    "intro": "Rivea shirensis, commonly known as the sweet sarsaparilla, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Convolvulaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces a milky sap that contains various alkaloids, some of which have been studied for their potential medicinal properties. Its rapid growth habit makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening, though it can become invasive if not properly managed."
