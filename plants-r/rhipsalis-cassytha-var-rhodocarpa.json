    "intro": "Rhipsalis cassytha var. rhodocarpa, commonly known as the red-berried mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of trees and shrubs. It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are covered in small, scale-like structures. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that are pollinated by insects, followed by red, fleshy berries that attract birds. Its leaves are alternate and have a waxy surface, aiding in water retention. This species is native to parts of South America and is often found in humid, tropical environments."
