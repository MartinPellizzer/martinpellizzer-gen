    "intro": "Rubus inedulis f. umbrosus, commonly known as the shadowy blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant characterized by its dark foliage and compact growth habit. It is a deciduous shrub that typically thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in woodlands and forest understories. The plant produces small, dark purple berries that are generally less palatable than those of the standard blackberry species. Its leaves are serrated and have a leathery texture, contributing to its ability to withstand lower light conditions. This form is prized in horticulture for its ornamental value and adaptability to shaded garden spaces."
