    "intro": "Rubus carpinifolius f. glandulosus, commonly known as the glandular bramble, is a variant of the common blackberry shrub. It is characterized by its dense, thorny growth habit and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black in color. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges or disturbed soils. Its glandular hairs on the stems and leaves give it a distinctive appearance and aid in moisture retention."
