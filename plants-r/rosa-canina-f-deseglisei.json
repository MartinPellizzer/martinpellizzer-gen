It is characterized by its pale pink to white flowers and thorny stems, typical of the Rosa canina species. This form is native to parts of Europe and is often found in hedgerows and woodland edges. The leaves are pinnate with five to seven leaflets, and the plant produces red, berry-like fruits. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental qualities and historical use in herbal medicine."
