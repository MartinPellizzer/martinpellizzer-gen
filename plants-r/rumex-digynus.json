    "intro": "Rumex digynus, commonly known as the two-flowered sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features alternate, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive reddish or purple coloration on the underside. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and arranged in clusters, with two stamens and one pistil, giving it its common name. Rumex digynus is known for its edible leaves, which have a tangy, sour flavor similar to other sorrel species."
