    "intro": "Rhizophora apiculata, commonly known as the mangrove apple or red mangrove, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rhizophoraceae. It is characterized by its aerial roots, which help in anchoring the plant and facilitating gas exchange in waterlogged soils. The plant thrives in coastal areas, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions, where it plays a crucial role in stabilizing shorelines. Its small, orange berries are an important food source for various bird and animal species. Rhizophora apiculata is also known for its ability to tolerate high salinity and periodic flooding, making it a key component of mangrove ecosystems."
