It is characterized by its thorny stems and aggregate fruits, which are typically dark purple to black in color. The plant is native to various regions in the Northern Hemisphere and thrives in a range of soil types. It produces small white or pink flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by the development of its edible berries. Rubus infestiformis is often found in woodland edges, thickets, and disturbed areas, where it spreads through both seeds and vegetative growth."
