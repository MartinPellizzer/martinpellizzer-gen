    "intro": "Ruckeria euryopsidis, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its woody stems and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant has adapted to harsh environments through features such as thick, waxy leaves that reduce water loss. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Ruckeria euryopsidis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat."
