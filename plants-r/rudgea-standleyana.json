    "intro": "Rudgea standleyana, commonly known as the Mexican bellflower, is a striking plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows as an upright shrub, reaching heights of up to 2 meters, with hairy stems and broad, ovate leaves. Its flowers, which range in color from white to deep pink, bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Rudgea standleyana is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
