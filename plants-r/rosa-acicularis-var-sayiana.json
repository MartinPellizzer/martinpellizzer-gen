    "intro": "Rosa acicularis var. sayiana, commonly known as the Say's thorned rose, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its sharp, thorned stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces oval, leathery leaves with a distinctive waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. It blooms in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in dry, sunny conditions."
