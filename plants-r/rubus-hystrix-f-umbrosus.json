    "intro": "Rubus hystrix f. umbrosus, commonly known as the dark raspberry or shadow raspberry, is a variant of the raspberry plant characterized by its dense, thorny stems and dark, almost black foliage. This form is typically found in shaded, woodland environments where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The leaves are usually elliptical with a serrated margin and a hairy surface, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or dark red in color, similar to other raspberry species. While less commonly cultivated than other Rubus species, it is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in shaded areas."
