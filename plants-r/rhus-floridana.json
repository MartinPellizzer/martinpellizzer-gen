    "intro": "Rhus floridana, commonly known as the Florida sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are divided into several narrow, pointed leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by red, fuzzy berries that are a food source for wildlife. Rhus floridana thrives in sandy or clay soils and is often found in open woodlands and along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an important component of local ecosystems and a subject of interest in botanical studies."
