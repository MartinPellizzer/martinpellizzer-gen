    "intro": "Rosa dryadophylla, commonly known as the dryad's leaf rose, is a rare and striking species native to the mountainous regions of Turkey. It is characterized by its unique, narrow, and leathery leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it conserve water in its arid habitat. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant pink to red flowers that bloom in late summer. Its growth habit is typically shrub-like, with multiple stems that can reach up to 1 meter in height. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Rosa dryadophylla is considered a rare and endangered species."
