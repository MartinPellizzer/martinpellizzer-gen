    "intro": "Rubus warrenii, commonly known as Warren's blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is characterized by its thorny stems, trifoliate leaves, and small, dark berries that ripen in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its flowers are usually white or pink, and they bloom in early spring. Rubus warrenii is valued for its ecological role in supporting local wildlife and its potential for use in native plant landscaping."
