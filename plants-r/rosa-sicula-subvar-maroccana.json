It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and clusters of small, fragrant pink or white flowers. The leaves are typically narrow and grayish-green, adapted to withstand arid conditions. This subvariety thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its botanical features reflect its evolutionary adaptation to the harsh, sun-exposed environments of its native habitat."
