    "intro": "Rubus cinerascens, commonly known as the gray bramble, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, edible berries in the summer. Its berries are often used in jams and wines, though they are typically smaller and less flavorful than those of other Rubus species. The plant thrives in moist, wooded areas and is adapted to partial shade."
