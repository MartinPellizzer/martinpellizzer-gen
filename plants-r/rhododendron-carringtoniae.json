    "intro": "Rhododendron carringtoniae, commonly known as the Carrington's rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of China. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows in high-altitude forests and rocky slopes. The plant features dark green, leathery leaves and produces clusters of bell-shaped, pink to purple flowers in the spring. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants adapted to acidic soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
