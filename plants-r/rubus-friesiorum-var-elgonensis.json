It is characterized by its dense, thorny growth and produces small, dark purple to black berries. The plant thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in forested areas at elevations above 1,500 meters. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the flowers are typically white or pale pink. The berries are used both for local consumption and in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
