    "intro": "Rhodax nebrodensis, commonly known as the Nebroden's rhodax, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the island of Sicily. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbel-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky and calcareous soils, often in humid microhabitats. Its flowers are small and white, appearing in clusters, and it blooms during the spring months. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
