    "intro": "Rudgea viburnoides var. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved rudgea, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is a shrub characterized by its opposite, lanceolate leaves that are broad and leathery in texture. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by bright red berries in the fall. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a landscape plant."
