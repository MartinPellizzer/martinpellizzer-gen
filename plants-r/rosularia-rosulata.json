    "intro": "Rosularia rosulata, commonly known as the Rosularia rosea, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing rosette structure composed of thick, fleshy, gray-green leaves. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers in shades of pink and white during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is a popular choice among gardeners interested in drought-tolerant plants."
