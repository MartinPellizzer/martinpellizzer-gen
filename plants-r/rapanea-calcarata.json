    "intro": "Rapanea calcarata, commonly known as the rock banyan, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and its ability to thrive in rocky or limestone soils. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by bright red, fleshy fruits. Its root system is extensive and can form a network that helps stabilize soil in rocky environments. Rapanea calcarata is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and adaptability to harsh conditions."
