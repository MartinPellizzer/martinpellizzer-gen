    "intro": "Rubus friesianus, commonly known as the Friesian blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the Netherlands. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically harvested in late summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
