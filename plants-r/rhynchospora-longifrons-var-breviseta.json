    "intro": "Rhynchospora longifrons var. breviseta, commonly known as the short-stalked beak sedge, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes grass-like plants known as sedges. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, forming dense clumps with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of a spike of small, three-lobed flowers, which are often greenish or reddish in color. This variant is distinguished by its shorter pedicels compared to the typical form of Rhynchospora longifrons."
