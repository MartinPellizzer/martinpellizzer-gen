It is characterized by its trailing stems and clusters of vibrant, tubular flowers that bloom during the holiday season. The plant has a unique structure with leaf-like stems that are segmented and can branch out profusely. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Rhipsalis hadrosoma is a popular ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
