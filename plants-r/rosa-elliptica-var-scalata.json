It features upright, thorny stems that bear alternate, elliptic to ovate leaves with a rough, hairy texture. The plant produces fragrant, single or semi-double flowers in shades of pink to red, typically appearing in late spring to early summer. Its flowers are borne on short pedicels and are surrounded by a distinctive, scalloped calyx that remains attached after blooming. This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens for its beauty and hardiness."
