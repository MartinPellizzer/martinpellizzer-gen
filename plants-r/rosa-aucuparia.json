    "intro": "Rosa aucuparia, commonly known as the bird cherry or common dogwood, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces bright red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. Its leaves are oval-shaped with serrated edges, and it has a woody stem covered in thorns. Rosa aucuparia is often found in woodland edges and moist soils, and it plays an important role in supporting local wildlife."
