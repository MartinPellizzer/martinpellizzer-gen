It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by dark purple to black berries in the fall. Rhamnus disperma is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and at high altitudes. Its berries are a food source for various birds and small mammals, contributing to its ecological significance in its native habitat."
