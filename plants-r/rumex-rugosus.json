    "intro": "Rumex rugosus, commonly known as rough dock, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features distinctive serrated, dark green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its root system is robust, allowing it to thrive in moist, disturbed soils along roadsides and in wetlands. Rumex rugosus is also known for its medicinal properties, historically used to treat ailments such as skin irritations and digestive issues."
