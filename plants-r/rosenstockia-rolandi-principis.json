    "intro": "Rosenstockia rolandi-principis, commonly known as the Principessa rose, is a rare and striking member of the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically display a blend of white and pink hues, with a distinctive red center. Native to the high altitudes of the Alps, this plant thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil. Its foliage consists of lobed, serrated leaves that are dark green and slightly hairy. Due to its limited distribution and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by specialty growers."
