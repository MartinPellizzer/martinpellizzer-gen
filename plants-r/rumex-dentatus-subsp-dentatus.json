    "intro": "Rumex dentatus subsp. dentatus, commonly known as the serrated dock, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves with serrated margins and bright red, clustered flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, along streams, and in woodland edges. It has a robust root system that allows it to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions. The species is noted for its medicinal properties, historically used for its astringent and anti-inflammatory effects."
