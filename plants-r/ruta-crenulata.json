    "intro": "Ruta crenulata, commonly known as fringed rue, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features aromatic, dark green leaves with distinctive wavy edges, and small yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is known for its strong, pungent odor, which is due to the presence of volatile oils. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens or borders. Ruta crenulata is also valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
