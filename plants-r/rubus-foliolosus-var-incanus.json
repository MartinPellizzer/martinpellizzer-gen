    "intro": "Rubus foliolosus var. incanus, commonly known as the silverleaf blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to parts of North America. It is characterized by its silvery-white undersides on its leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically smaller than those of other blackberry varieties. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas. The botanical features of this plant make it a distinctive and ornamental species within the Rubus genus."
