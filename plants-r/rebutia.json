    "intro": "Rebutia, commonly known as the ice plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Cactaceae. These plants are native to arid regions of South America, particularly in Argentina and Chile. Rebutia species are characterized by their compact, globular or cylindrical stems and vibrant, showy flowers that bloom in shades of yellow, orange, and red. They are succulent plants, adapted to store water in their thick, fleshy stems and leaves. Rebutia is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its resilience and attractive appearance."
