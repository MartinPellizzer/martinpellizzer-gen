    "intro": "Ricinophyllum, commonly known as the poison ivy vine, is a climbing plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its opposite, simple, and often lobed leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in cyathia, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its most notable feature is the presence of a toxic sap containing ricin, which can cause severe skin irritation. Ricinophyllum is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks."
