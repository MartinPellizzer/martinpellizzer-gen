    "intro": "Rottboellia stigmosa, commonly known as the African feather grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands or disturbed areas. Rottboellia stigmosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
