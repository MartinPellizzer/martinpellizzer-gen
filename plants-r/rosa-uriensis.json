    "intro": "Rosa uriensis, commonly known as the Colorado cliffrose, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and clusters of small, fragrant pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and arid environments. Its leaves are pinnately compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets. Rosa uriensis is valued for its hardiness and adaptability, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping and ornamental gardening."
