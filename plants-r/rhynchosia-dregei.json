    "intro": "Rhynchosia dregei, commonly known as the dwarf cowpea, is a herbaceous annual plant native to southern Africa. It features slender, branching stems and trifoliate leaves with heart-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are followed by elongated, cylindrical pods containing edible seeds. Rhynchosia dregei thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. It is valued both for its ornamental appeal and as a source of protein-rich seeds."
