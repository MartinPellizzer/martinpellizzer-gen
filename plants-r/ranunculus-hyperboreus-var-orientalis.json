    "intro": "Ranunculus hyperboreus var. orientalis, commonly known as the Siberian buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the colder regions of Asia and Europe. It features delicate, palmate leaves and showy, yellow flowers with a distinctive dark center. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subarctic environments. Its flowers are typically short-lived, blooming in late spring to early summer. Due to its habitat preferences, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator of cold climates."
