It is characterized by its simple, opposite, and often hairy leaves that are typically elliptic to ovate in shape. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, followed by spherical, fleshy fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands or along waterways. Due to its adaptability, it can become invasive in certain environments."
