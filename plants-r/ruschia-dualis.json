    "intro": "Ruschia dualis, commonly known as the double-flowered Ruschia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features vibrant, tubular flowers that come in shades of red, orange, and yellow, often with a second, smaller flower at the base of each bloom. The plant has fleshy, narrow leaves that are typically blue-green in color, adapted to store water. It thrives in well-draining soil and full sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Its unique floral structure and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and ornamental gardening."
