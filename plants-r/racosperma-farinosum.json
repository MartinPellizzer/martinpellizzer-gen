    "intro": "Racosperma farinosum, commonly known as the sticky wattle, is a shrub native to Australia. It is characterized by its yellow flowers and sticky, glandular leaves that release a sticky substance. The plant belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal regions. The sticky leaves help deter herbivores, making it well adapted to its environment."
