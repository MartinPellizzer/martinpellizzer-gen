    "intro": "Rubus mucronatus var. drejeriformis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, thornless stems and small, elliptical leaves with a slightly serrated edge. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically smaller than those of other blackberry species. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species in its native range."
