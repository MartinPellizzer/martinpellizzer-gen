    "intro": "Ricinocarpus oxyodontus, commonly known as the sea hake or sea hake tree, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its woody structure and palm-like leaves, which are often used in traditional medicine. The plant produces small, white flowers followed by distinctive, fleshy fruits that contain toxic seeds. Its ability to thrive in saline and tidal environments makes it an important component of coastal ecosystems. Due to its unique adaptations, it plays a role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms."
