It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are typically arranged in opposite pairs along the stems. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually greenish-white in color, followed by edible, fig-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
