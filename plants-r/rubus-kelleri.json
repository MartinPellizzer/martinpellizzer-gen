It is native to the Pacific Northwest of North America, particularly found in moist, shaded forest environments. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically harvested in late summer. Its leaves are compound, with three to five leaflets, and the plant has thorny stems typical of many Rubus species. It plays an important ecological role by providing food for wildlife and contributing to forest biodiversity."
