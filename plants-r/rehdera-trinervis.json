    "intro": "Rehdera trinervis, commonly known as the three-veined rehdera, is a herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, lance-shaped leaves with three distinct veins. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. Rehdera trinervis thrives in well-drained soils and requires a humid, shaded environment to flourish."
