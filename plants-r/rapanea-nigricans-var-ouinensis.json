    "intro": "Rapanea nigricans var. ouinensis, commonly known as the Ouin\u00e9 rapanea, is a rare evergreen shrub native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a glossy surface. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by dark blue berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of dense forest canopies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
