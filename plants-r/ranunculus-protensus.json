It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers, which typically consist of a central cluster of stamens surrounded by a ring of petal-like sepals. The plant has a herbaceous growth habit, with leaves that are palmately divided and covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges. Ranunculus protensus is an important species for pollinators and contributes to the biodiversity of its native habitats."
