It is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Myanmar and Thailand. The plant features lush, broad leaves that form a rosette, and it produces showy, orange-yellow flowers with a distinctive, spicy fragrance. Its bloom period typically occurs in late spring to early summer, making it a sought-after ornamental plant in subtropical gardens. The varietal form 'lutea' is distinguished by its vivid yellow coloration, which sets it apart from the more common green-flowered varieties."
