    "intro": "Rosa canina var. diversiglandulosa, commonly known as the variable hippeastrum, is a variant of the dog rose. It is characterized by its distinctive glandular structures on the stems and leaves, which give it its scientific name. The plant typically produces clusters of fragrant pink or white flowers in the spring. Its hips, which are the fruit, are orange-red and contain a high concentration of vitamin C. This variety is often found in woodland areas and along hedgebanks in its native range."
