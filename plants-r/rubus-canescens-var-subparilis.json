    "intro": "Rubus canescens var. subparilis, commonly known as the silverleaf bramble, is a shrub native to North America. It is characterized by its silvery-white undersides on its leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, red or yellow berries that are edible but often tart in flavor. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and open woodlands. Its thorny stems and dense growth habit make it both a persistent weed and a habitat for various wildlife species."
