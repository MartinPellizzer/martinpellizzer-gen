It features a basal rosette of smooth, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive yellowish-green color. The plant produces upright flowering stems topped with clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats."
