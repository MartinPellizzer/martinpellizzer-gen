    "intro": "Rosa sepium var. mentita, commonly known as the Mentita rose, is a hybrid rose species originating from the cross between Rosa rugosa and Rosa centifolia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and abundant, fragrant blooms that typically appear in shades of pink and white. The plant is well-suited for coastal climates due to its salt tolerance and disease resistance. Its foliage is dark green and slightly hairy, providing a striking contrast to its showy flowers. Mentita roses are often cultivated for their ornamental value and are relatively easy to care for in garden settings."
