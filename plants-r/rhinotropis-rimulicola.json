    "intro": "Rhinotropis rimulicola, commonly known as the yellow sand-verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is a low-growing perennial that typically reaches heights of less than 10 inches, with small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has hairy, narrow leaves and thrives in well-drained soils, often found in disturbed or sandy habitats. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
