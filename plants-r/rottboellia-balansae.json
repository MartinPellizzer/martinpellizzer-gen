It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Rottboellia balansae is also used in some traditional medicinal practices due to its potential bioactive compounds."
