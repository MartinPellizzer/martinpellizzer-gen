    "intro": "Rosa canina f. bregutiensis, commonly known as the Bregutian dog rose, is a botanical variant of the common dog rose, characterized by its distinctive floral and foliar features. It is native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans, where it thrives in rocky and well-drained soils. The plant produces pale pink to white flowers with a subtle fragrance, and its leaves are typically smaller and more densely arranged than those of the typical Rosa canina. It is a deciduous shrub that can grow up to 2\u20133 meters in height, often forming dense thickets. Due to its limited distribution and unique traits, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical studies."
