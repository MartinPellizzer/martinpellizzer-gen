    "intro": "Relhania conferta, commonly known as the African snowbush, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, black berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Relhania conferta is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
