    "intro": "Rosa canina var. meratiana, commonly known as the Meratian dog rose, is a variant of the dog rose native to parts of Eastern Europe and the Caucasus. It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces fragrant, pinkish-white flowers in early summer, followed by red, berry-like hips that are rich in vitamin C. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in hedgerows and woodland edges. Due to its ornamental value and historical significance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and conservation efforts."
