    "intro": "Rubus raunkiaeri, commonly known as the Greenland rose, is a species of bramble native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit and prickly stems, typical of the Rubus genus. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by red, edible berries. It thrives in cold, moist environments and is often found in tundra and alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized plant."
