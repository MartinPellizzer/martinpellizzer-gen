    "intro": "Rubus menkei var. dissociatus, commonly known as the Menkei raspberry variant, is a species of bramble native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red when mature. The plant features compound leaves with serrated margins and has a woody stem structure typical of the Rubus genus. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
