    "intro": "Rhododendron amagianum, commonly known as the Amagian rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Japan. It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and showy, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring with clusters of pink to purple flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, providing a striking contrast to the vibrant floral display. Rhododendron amagianum thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in cool, moist forested areas."
