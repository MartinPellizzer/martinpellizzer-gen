    "intro": "Ranunculus aquatilis var. confusus, commonly known as the water crowfoot, is a aquatic or semi-aquatic plant found in freshwater habitats such as ponds, streams, and wet meadows. It has finely divided, feather-like leaves that float on the water surface or extend underwater, aiding in photosynthesis. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in early spring. It is characterized by its delicate appearance and preference for still or slow-moving water. Ranunculus aquatilis var. confusus plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and small fish."
