    "intro": "Rhinanthus vernalis, commonly known as the autumnal tickseed, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers that bloom from June to September. The plant typically grows in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, wastelands, and meadows, preferring well-drained soils. It has a branching stem with opposite leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Rhinanthus vernalis plays a role in supporting pollinators, particularly bees, due to its abundant nectar-rich flowers."
