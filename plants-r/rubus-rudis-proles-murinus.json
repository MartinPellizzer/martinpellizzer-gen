    "intro": "Rubus rudis proles murinus, commonly known as the coastal bramble, is a shrub native to coastal regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its prickly stems and compound leaves that are adapted to withstand salty sea air and strong winds. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits known as berries, which are typically red or black in color. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in dunes or along cliff faces. Due to its hardy nature, it plays an important role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems."
