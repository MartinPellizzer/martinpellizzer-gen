    "intro": "Rhynchospora odorata, commonly known as the fragrant spike-rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States. It typically grows in marshy areas, pond margins, and other moist environments, where it forms dense stands. The plant produces tall, cylindrical spikes of small, pale green to brownish flowers that are often tinged with reddish hues. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and arranged in two rows along the stem. Rhynchospora odorata is notable for its distinctive, often fragrant flowers that attract various pollinators, including bees and flies."
