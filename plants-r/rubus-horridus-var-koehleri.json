    "intro": "Rubus horridus var. koehleri, commonly known as the Koehler's bramble, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits known as raspberries, which are typically red and edible. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and agroforestry systems."
