    "intro": "Rubus brevipedalis, commonly known as the short-stemmed blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the western United States. It is characterized by its thorny stems, trifoliate leaves, and small, dark purple berries that ripen in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and streambanks. Its flowers are white with five petals and are pollinated by insects. The berries are edible but have a tart flavor, making them suitable for jams and pies."
