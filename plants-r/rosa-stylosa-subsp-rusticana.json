    "intro": "Rosa stylosa subsp. rusticana, commonly known as the rusty rose, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and thorny stems, which are often covered in a rusty-colored bloom of fine, glandular hairs. The leaves are trifoliate, with each leaflet having a serrated margin and a slightly hairy surface. Its flowers are typically pink to red, with five petals and numerous stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often found in rocky or open woodland habitats."
