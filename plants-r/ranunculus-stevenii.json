    "intro": "Ranunculus stevenii, commonly known as Steven's buttercup, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, bright yellow flowers with numerous petals. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three deeply lobed leaflets, and it produces a basal rosette of foliage. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
