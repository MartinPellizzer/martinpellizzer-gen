    "intro": "Ruellia pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf ruellia, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and Central America. It is a low-growing perennial that typically reaches a height of only a few inches, making it ideal for rock gardens or as a ground cover. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are usually blue or purple in color, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Ruellia pygmaea is relatively drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a hardy choice for gardeners in temperate climates."
