    "intro": "Rubus schmidelyanus subsp. amictus, commonly known as the Schmidel's raspberry, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red when ripe, with a tart flavor. The plant has compound leaves with serrated edges and thorny stems typical of the Rubus genus. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in humid, forested areas. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and less commonly cultivated species."
