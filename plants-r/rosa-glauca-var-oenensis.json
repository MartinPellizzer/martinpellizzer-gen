It is characterized by its deep blue petals, which are a result of high concentrations of anthocyanins. This variety is native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and thrives in cool, moist climates. The plant produces fragrant, single flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique coloration in botanical gardens and specialized horticulture."
