    "intro": "Racosperma tetanophyllum, commonly known as the narrow-leafed acacia, is a shrub native to Australia. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod fruits. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its small, yellow flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces cylindrical seed pods that split open when mature. Racosperma tetanophyllum is often used in revegetation projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil."
