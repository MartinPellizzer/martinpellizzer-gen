It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves and showy, red bracts that resemble flowers.

It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value as well as its economic importance. The plant contains ricin, a potent toxin, which makes it potentially hazardous if handled improperly."
