These plants are native to various regions in the Americas, particularly in tropical and subtropical areas. Recordia species are typically shrubs or small trees, characterized by their showy, often pink or red, hibiscus-like flowers. The leaves are usually palmately lobed, and the plants often have hairy stems and foliage. They thrive in well-drained soils and are often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests or along stream banks."
