    "intro": "Rosa crassatula, commonly known as the stone rose, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It features dense, compact growth with small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white powder. The plant produces showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Rosa crassatula is prized in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in rocky or sandy soils."
