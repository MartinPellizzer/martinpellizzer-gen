    "intro": "Ranunculus repens var. macranthus, commonly known as the broad-flowered buttercup, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, often along the edges of water bodies. The plant features bright yellow flowers with five broad, petal-like sepals, and it produces small, green, oval-shaped fruits. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they are divided into three leaflets, and are often covered in fine hairs. This variety is distinguished by its larger, more showy flowers compared to the typical Ranunculus repens."
