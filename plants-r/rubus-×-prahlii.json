    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 prahlii, commonly known as the hybrid blackberry or loganberry, is a deciduous shrub belonging to the Rosaceae family. It is a natural hybrid between Rubus ursinus (blackberry) and Rubus pectoralis (loganberry), resulting in a plant that exhibits traits of both parents. The plant produces large, dark purple to black berries that are typically sweet and juicy, with a firm texture. It thrives in temperate climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Due to its vigorous growth and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and for commercial fruit production."
