It features showy, cup-shaped flowers with numerous petals that range in color from white to yellow, pink, and red. The plant has a hairy stem and basal leaves that are typically lobed or divided. Its roots are thick and fleshy, contributing to its common name. Ranunculus obesus thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks."
