    "intro": "Rheitrophyllum, commonly known as the desert bell, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to survive in harsh, dry environments. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Rheitrophyllum plays an important role in stabilizing desert soils and providing nectar for pollinators."
