    "intro": "Rhododendron luteosquamatum, commonly known as the yellow-scaled rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking yellow to orange-red flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dense, evergreen forests at elevations ranging from 1,000 to 2,500 meters. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, often covered with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. The species is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and specialized horticultural collections."
