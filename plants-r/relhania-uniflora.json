    "intro": "Relhania uniflora, commonly known as the single-flower relhania, is a species of flowering plant native to the rainforests of South America. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many familiar plants such as coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and elliptical leaves with a leathery texture. It typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in the canopy layer of the forest. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Relhania uniflora is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
