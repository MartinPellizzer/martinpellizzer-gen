    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 hollowayi, commonly known as the Holloway blackberry, is a hybrid species within the Rubus genus, characterized by its thorny stems and aggregate fruits. It is native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States and is valued for its large, flavorful berries. The plant typically grows as a shrub, reaching heights of up to 2 meters, with dark green, serrated leaves. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, and it produces edible berries that are often used in jams and desserts. Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits a range of genetic variability, making it an interesting subject for horticultural study."
