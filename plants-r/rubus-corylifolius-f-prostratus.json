    "intro": "Rubus corylifolius f. prostratus, commonly known as the prostrate blackberry, is a low-growing variant of the blackberry plant native to East Asia. It features dense, thorny stems that hug the ground, forming a mat-like structure. The leaves are typically trifoliate, with serrated edges and a dark green, glossy appearance. Its flowers are small, white, and clustered in racemes, followed by dark purple berries that are edible. This plant is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
