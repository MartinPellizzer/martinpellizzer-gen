    "intro": "Rhus trifoliata, commonly known as the sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, typically consisting of three leaflets, which give it the species name \"trifoliata.\" The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in spring, followed by red, fuzzy berries that are a food source for birds and wildlife. Rhus trifoliata is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to a wide range of environmental conditions. Its leaves and berries contain compounds that have been used in traditional medicine and as a natural dye."
