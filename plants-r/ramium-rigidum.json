    "intro": "Ramium rigidum, commonly known as rigid rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy environments in the eastern United States. It features upright, grass-like stems that are typically rigid and covered in fine, hair-like structures. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish flowers arranged in clusters at the base of the stems. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and often have a slight waxy coating, aiding in water retention. Ramium rigidum plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic and semi-aquatic organisms."
