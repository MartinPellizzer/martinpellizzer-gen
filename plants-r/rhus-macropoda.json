    "intro": "Rhus macropoda, commonly known as the broadleaf sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 5 to 9 pairs of oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by red, fuzzy berries that persist into winter. Rhus macropoda thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in swamps, riverbanks, and other wetland habitats. It plays an important role in supporting local wildlife, providing food and shelter for various birds and insects."
