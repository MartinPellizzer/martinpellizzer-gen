    "intro": "Rhododendron mucronulatum var. ciliatum, commonly known as the Ciliate Rhododendron, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It features broad, leathery leaves that are often adorned with fine, ciliate (fringed) margins, giving it its botanical name. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to red, typically blooming in late spring. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its attractive foliage and showy blooms, which contribute to its ecological and horticultural significance."
