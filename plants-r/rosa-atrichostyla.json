    "intro": "Rosa atrichostyla, commonly known as the glabrous rose, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, hairless stems and leaves, which contribute to its common name. The plant produces fragrant, single or double flowers in shades of pink to red, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its flowers are followed by oval, red-orange hips that contain seeds. Rosa atrichostyla is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively disease-resistant compared to other rose species."
