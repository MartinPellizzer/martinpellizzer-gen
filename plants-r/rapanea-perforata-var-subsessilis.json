    "intro": "Rapanea perforata var. subsessilis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved boxwood, is a shrub native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage with small, oval-shaped leaves that are often slightly hairy. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and hardiness. This variant is distinguished by its shorter leaf stalks compared to other varieties of Rapanea perforata."
