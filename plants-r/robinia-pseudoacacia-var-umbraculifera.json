It is characterized by its distinctive, umbrella-shaped compound leaves that provide shade. The plant is native to the southeastern United States and thrives in well-drained soils. It produces small, yellow flowers in spring, followed by flat, dehiscent pods. The leaves are often used in horticulture for their ornamental value and shade-providing capacity."
