    "intro": "Rosa pumila var. rosamundi, commonly known as the alpine rose, is a compact shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has dense, thorny stems and dark green, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white hairs. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for gardeners in colder climates."
