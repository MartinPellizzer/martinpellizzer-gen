    "intro": "Ranunculus spryginii, commonly known as the Crimean buttercup, is a flowering plant native to the Crimean Peninsula. It is a member of the Ranunculaceae family, characterized by its showy, often yellow or white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist meadows and along stream banks, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are palmately divided, and it produces small, aggregate fruits that disperse its seeds. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
