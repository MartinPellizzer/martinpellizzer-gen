    "intro": "Roegneria kokonorica, commonly known as the Tibetan quackgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of Tibet and adjacent areas in China. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, bluish-green leaves that are typically shorter than the flowering stems. The plant produces dense clusters of spikelets, which are arranged in a panicle-like structure, and the flowers are usually green to brown in color. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Roegneria kokonorica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
