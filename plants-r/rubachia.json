    "intro": "Rubachia, commonly known as the lesser celandine, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its early spring emergence and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from March to May. Rubachia thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its aggressive growth habit."
