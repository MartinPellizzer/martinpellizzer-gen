    "intro": "Rubus chloocladus subsp. flaccidus, commonly known as the flaccid blackberry, is a shrub native to parts of eastern North America. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and produces small, dark purple to black berries. The plant has compound leaves with three to five leaflets, and its flowers are typically white or pale pink. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas. The fruit is edible but has a tart flavor, making it a minor wild fruit resource."
