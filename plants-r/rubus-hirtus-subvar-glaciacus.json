    "intro": "Rubus hirtus subvar. glaciacus, commonly known as the alpine raspberry, is a variant of the brambles native to high-altitude regions. It is characterized by its dense, prickly stems and small, aggregate fruits that typically mature to a red or black color. The plant thrives in cold, rocky environments and is often found in alpine tundra and mountainous areas. Its leaves are usually hairy and have a serrated edge, contributing to its rugged appearance. This subspecies is adapted to harsh climates and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats."
