    "intro": "Rubus infestus microgene altipratensis, commonly known as the Alpine blackberry, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its thorny stems and dark red to black berries that ripen in late summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it produces clusters of small white flowers in early spring. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in local traditional medicine."
