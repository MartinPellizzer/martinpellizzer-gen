    "intro": "Rubus praticolor, commonly known as the purple-fruited blackberry, is a species of bramble native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that turn a striking purple-red color when mature. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
