    "intro": "Rubus foliosus proles lipopogon, commonly known as the coastal bramble, is a shrub native to coastal regions of the Pacific Northwest. It is characterized by its thorny stems and trifoliate leaves, which are typically lobed and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are usually red or black in color, similar to other bramble species. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to salt spray and wind exposure. Its botanical features make it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
