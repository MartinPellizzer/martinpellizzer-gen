    "intro": "Rhododendron \u00d7 magorianum, commonly known as the Magorian rhododendron, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Rhododendron catawbiense and Rhododendron maximum. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep pink. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 6 meters. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to bloom in late spring to early summer."
