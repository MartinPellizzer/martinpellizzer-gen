    "intro": "Rumex hastifolius, commonly known as narrow-leaved dock, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features upright, hairy stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height, often branching near the top. The leaves are lance-shaped, with a distinctive waxy coating and serrated edges, and they are typically arranged alternately along the stem. Its flowers are small, greenish-yellow, and clustered in loose, terminal spikes, producing capsules that contain numerous seeds. This plant thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and along riverbanks."
