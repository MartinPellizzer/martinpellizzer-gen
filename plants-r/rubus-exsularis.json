It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black in color. It thrives in coastal environments, preferring sandy or gravelly soils and full sun. Due to its hardy nature, it is often found in disturbed habitats and along shorelines."
