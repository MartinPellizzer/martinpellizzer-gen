    "intro": "Rhus sempervirens, commonly known as the evergreen sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and turn vibrant red in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in panicles, followed by red, fuzzy fruits that are an important food source for birds. Its bark is smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age, and it is often found in moist, rich soils along stream banks. Rhus sempervirens is valued for its ornamental qualities and ability to thrive in partial shade."
