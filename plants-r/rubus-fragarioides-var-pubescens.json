    "intro": "Rubus fragarioides var. pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent blackberry, is a thorny shrub native to the eastern United States. It produces aggregate fruits composed of small, dark red to black drupelets that are typically eaten raw or used in jams and pies. The plant has trifoliate leaves with serrated edges and hairy stems, which contribute to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and thickets. The flowers are white with five petals and are followed by the characteristic fruiting bodies that give the plant its common name."
