    "intro": "Ricinus communis var. undulatus, commonly known as the wavy-cotyledon or undulate castor bean, is a variant of the castor oil plant characterized by its uniquely wavy or undulating cotyledons. This plant is native to tropical regions and is known for its ornamental value due to its striking, palmate leaves. The leaves are typically large, with a deep green color and a slightly hairy texture. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by spiny, capsule-like fruits containing toxic seeds. Despite its ornamental appeal, it is important to note that all parts of the plant contain toxic compounds, making it potentially hazardous to humans and animals."
