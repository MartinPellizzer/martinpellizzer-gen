    "intro": "Rhinanthus alectorolophus var. freynii, commonly known as the Freyn's yellow-rattle, is a flowering plant native to western Europe. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, characterized by its parasitic growth habit, though it does not completely rely on its host for survival. The plant produces showy yellow-orange flowers that bloom from June to August, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It typically grows in dry, open habitats like grasslands and heaths, often in association with grasses and other herbs. Its ecological role includes supporting insect populations and contributing to the biodiversity of its habitat."
