    "intro": "Ruta linifolia var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy rue, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features aromatic, lance-shaped leaves covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive textured appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by winged, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or dry habitats. Due to its aromatic compounds, it has been used traditionally in herbal remedies and as a spice."
