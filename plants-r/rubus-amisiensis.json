    "intro": "Rubus amisiensis, commonly known as the Amisiensis blackberry, is a species of brambles native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understorey of tropical forests. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and less-studied species within the Rubus genus."
