    "intro": "Rosa serafinii f. ligustica, commonly known as the Ligustic\u73ab\u7470, is a rare and unique cultivar of the Rosa serafinii species. It is characterized by its distinctive, deeply lobed leaves and its fragrant, pale pink to white flowers. The plant is native to the mountainous regions of southern Italy, specifically the Dolomites. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires a cool, temperate climate to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by specialized horticulturists."
