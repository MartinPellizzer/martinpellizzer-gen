    "intro": "Rubus caesius var. denudatus, commonly known as the naked-stem blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often hairless stems and small, dark red to black berries. The plant typically grows in shrubland and woodland edges, preferring well-drained soils. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, and it produces edible fruits that are smaller and less sweet compared to common blackberries. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional herbal medicine."
