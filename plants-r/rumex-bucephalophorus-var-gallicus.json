    "intro": "Rumex bucephalophorus var. gallicus, commonly known as the Gallic dock, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils, often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. The plant features broad, waxy leaves with a distinctive reddish or purple underside, and it produces small, greenish flowers in dense clusters during the summer months. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, making it a common weed in agricultural areas. The plant is also valued for its historical use in herbal medicine and as a forage crop for livestock."
