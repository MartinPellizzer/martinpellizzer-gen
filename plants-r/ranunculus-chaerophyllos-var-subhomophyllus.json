    "intro": "Ranunculus chaerophyllos var. subhomophyllus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water crowfoot, is a perennial aquatic plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds, streams, and wet meadows. The plant features delicate, palmately divided leaves that are often submerged or floating on the water surface. Its flowers are usually bright yellow with five petals and numerous stamens, typical of the Ranunculaceae family. The varietal name 'subhomophyllus' refers to its nearly uniform leaf structure, distinguishing it from other varieties of the species."
