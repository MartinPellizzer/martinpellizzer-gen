    "intro": "Ranunculus misniensis, commonly known as the Misni's buttercup, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family, which includes many showy, often toxic species. The plant produces delicate, five-petaled flowers in shades of yellow, white, and orange, typically blooming in early spring. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three deeply lobed leaflets, and it thrives in cool, moist environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
