    "intro": "Rubus corymbosus var. macrurus, commonly known as the large-fruited blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its large, dark purple to black berries that are typically larger than those of the standard Rubus corymbosus. The plant produces compound leaves with three to five leaflets, and its flowers are white with five petals. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. The berries are edible, though they have a tart flavor and are often used in jams and pies."
