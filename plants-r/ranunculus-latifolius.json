    "intro": "Ranunculus latifolius, commonly known as the broadleaf buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features showy, cup-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange with dark centers, often surrounded by a ring of sepals. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are alternate along the stem. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. Ranunculus latifolius is known for its ability to spread through rhizomes, making it both a decorative garden plant and a potential weed in natural habitats."
