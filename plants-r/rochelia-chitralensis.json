    "intro": "Rochelia chitralensis, commonly known as the Chitral rock rose, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of northern Pakistan and Afghanistan. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its compact, mat-like growth habit. The plant produces showy, pink or red flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, adapted to the harsh, cold climate of its habitat. Rochelia chitralensis is often found on rocky slopes and in alpine meadows, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
