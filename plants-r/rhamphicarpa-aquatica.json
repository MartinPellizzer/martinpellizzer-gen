    "intro": "Rhamphicarpa aquatica, commonly known as the water lily of the genus Rhamphicarpa, is a rare aquatic plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves and showy, white or pink flowers that bloom above the water surface. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and marshes. Its roots anchor it to the substrate, while its leaves provide shade and oxygen to the surrounding water. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
