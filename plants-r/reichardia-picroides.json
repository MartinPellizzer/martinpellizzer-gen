    "intro": "Reichardia picroides, commonly known as the stinkweed, is a flowering plant species native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants such as buckwheat and sorrel. The plant is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that appear in late spring. Reichardia picroides is often found in moist, disturbed soils along roadsides and in wetlands. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread easily."
