It typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant features delicate, palmately divided leaves and bright yellow flowers with five to eight petals. It is characterized by its short stature and is adapted to the harsh environmental conditions of its mountainous habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
