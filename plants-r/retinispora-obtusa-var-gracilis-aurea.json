Native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, this plant thrives in warm, humid climates with bright, indirect light. Its foliage is often variegated, featuring a mix of green and yellow tones that enhance its visual appeal in gardens or as a houseplant. The plant is relatively low-maintenance, requiring well-draining soil and regular watering to prevent root rot. While it does not produce showy flowers, its unique leaf structure makes it a prized addition to collections of exotic foliage plants."
