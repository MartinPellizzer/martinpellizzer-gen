    "intro": "Rosa abietina var. addensis, commonly known as the Alpine rose, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically features dark green, leathery leaves that are arranged alternately along the stems. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
