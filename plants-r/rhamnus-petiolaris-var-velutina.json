    "intro": "Rhamnus petiolaris var. velutina, commonly known as the velvetleaf buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to parts of eastern North America. It is characterized by its smooth, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by dark blue berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or thickets. Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural or natural areas."
