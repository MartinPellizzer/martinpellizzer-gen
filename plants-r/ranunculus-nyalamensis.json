    "intro": "Ranunculus nyalamensis, commonly known as the Nyalam buttercup, is a flowering plant native to the Himalayan region of Nepal and northern India. It is a herbaceous perennial with a short, rhizomatous stem and bright yellow, cup-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and mountain meadows. Its leaves are deeply lobed and have a rough, hairy texture, while its flowers are often surrounded by a cluster of sepals. Ranunculus nyalamensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also of interest in botanical research due to its unique adaptations to high-altitude ecosystems."
