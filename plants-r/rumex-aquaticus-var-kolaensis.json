    "intro": "Rumex aquaticus var. kolaensis, commonly known as the Kola swamp sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of West Africa. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in swampy areas and along riverbanks. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with a reddish or purple tinge on the underside, and it produces small, greenish flowers in clusters. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a common sight in aquatic habitats. The species is valued for its medicinal properties and is sometimes used in traditional herbal remedies."
