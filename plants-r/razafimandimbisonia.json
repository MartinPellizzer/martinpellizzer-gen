It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its unique, star-shaped flowers that bloom in a striking combination of colors. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific soil conditions to flourish. Its conservation status is critically endangered due to habitat destruction and over-collection. Researchers are working to protect and propagate this remarkable botanical species to ensure its survival."
