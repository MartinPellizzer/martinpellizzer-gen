    "intro": "Rosa candolleana pendula, commonly known as the hanging candytuft, is a species of flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its dense clusters of small, white to pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant features gray-green foliage and produces fragrant, five-petaled blooms that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. The pendulous growth habit of its flowers gives it a unique, cascading appearance."
