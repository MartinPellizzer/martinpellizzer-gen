    "intro": "Rhododendron albrechtii f. hypoleucum, commonly known as the white-flowered albrecht rhododendron, is a rare and distinctive plant species native to the high altitudes of western Africa. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its showy, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in dense, evergreen forests and requires well-drained, acidic soils. Its foliage consists of broad, leathery leaves that provide a striking contrast to the pale blooms. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
