    "intro": "Rhododendron bryophilum, commonly known as the mossy rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine, moss-like coating, which helps it retain moisture in its humid, shaded habitat. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pale pink to deep red, typically blooming in late spring. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in cloud forests at elevations between 1,000 and 2,500 meters. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
