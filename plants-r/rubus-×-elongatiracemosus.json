    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 elongatiracemosus, commonly known as the blackberry raspberry hybrid, is a polyploid plant resulting from the cross between Rubus ursinus (the blackberry) and Rubus chamaemorus (the cloudberry). It exhibits characteristics of both parent species, with dark red to black berries that are typically smaller than those of pure blackberries. The plant is a perennial shrub with thorny stems and trifoliate leaves, commonly found in temperate regions. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often cultivated for its edible fruits. Due to its hybrid nature, it can exhibit genetic variability in fruit size, color, and flavor."
