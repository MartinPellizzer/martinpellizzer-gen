    "intro": "Rhododendron dilatatum, commonly known as the alpine azalea, is a species native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, such as alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, providing a striking contrast to its vibrant blooms. Rhododendron dilatatum is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and resilience in challenging climates."
