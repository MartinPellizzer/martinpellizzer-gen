    "intro": "Rhynchosia luteola var. velutina, commonly known as the velvetleaf cowpea, is a tropical legume native to Africa and cultivated in warm climates. It is characterized by its hairy, velvety stems and heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive pubescent surface. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that give way to elongated, pod-like fruits containing edible seeds. It is often grown as a forage crop and for its nutritional seeds, which are rich in protein. The species is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, improving soil fertility."
