    "intro": "Rhinanthus crista-galli var. major, commonly known as the common yellow rattle, is a flowering plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in open grasslands and meadows, often in areas with well-drained soil. Its role in promoting plant diversity by reducing competition makes it an important species in ecological restoration projects."
