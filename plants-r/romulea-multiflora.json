    "intro": "Romulea multiflora, commonly known as the many-flowered romulea, is a perennial bulbous plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Iridaceae and is characterized by its compact, grass-like foliage and clusters of delicate, bell-shaped flowers. The plant produces numerous small, white or pale pink blooms during the spring and early summer. Its bulbs are adapted to survive dry periods, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Romulea multiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and ease of cultivation in well-drained soil."
