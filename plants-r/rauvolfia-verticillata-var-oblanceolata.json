    "intro": "Rauvolfia verticillata var. oblanceolata, commonly known as the Indian snakeroot, is a climbing plant native to tropical regions of Asia. It has slender, twining stems that ascend by means of tendrils, often found in moist, shaded forest environments. The plant features heart-shaped, dark green leaves arranged in whorls around the stem. Its flowers are small, white or pale yellow, and it produces berries that are typically orange or red in color. This species is notable for its medicinal properties, particularly due to the presence of alkaloids like reserpine."
