    "intro": "Rivina acuminata, commonly known as the velvetleaf or redroot, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, red or orange flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Rivina acuminata is often found in moist, disturbed soils and is considered an invasive species in some regions."
