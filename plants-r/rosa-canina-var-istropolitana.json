It typically features pale pink to white flowers with a subtle fragrance, and its bracteolate sepals are often more pronounced than in other Rosa canina varieties. The plant is known for its robust growth habit, with thorny stems and pinnate leaves that have serrated margins. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for both ornamental and hedgerow planting. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical significance in botanical gardens and traditional landscapes."
