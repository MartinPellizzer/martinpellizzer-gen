    "intro": "Rubus allmannensis, commonly known as the Allmann's blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the eastern United States. It is a deciduous shrub that produces edible berries, which are typically dark red to black in color. The plant has compound leaves with three to five leaflets and produces white or pale pink flowers in the spring. Its fruit is often used in jams and pies, though it is less commonly cultivated than other blackberry varieties. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and thickets."
