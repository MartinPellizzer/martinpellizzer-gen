    "intro": "Ricinocarpos bowmanii var. planus, commonly known as the flat-leafed sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid regions of Australia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its compound umbels and aromatic foliage. The plant features narrow, flat leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. Its flowers are small and white, arranged in umbrella-like clusters, and it produces small, dry fruits known as schizocarps. This species is well-suited to sandy soils and is often found in coastal or inland dunes."
