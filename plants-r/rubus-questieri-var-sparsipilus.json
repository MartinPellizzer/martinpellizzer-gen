It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits known as drupes, which are typically red or black in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
