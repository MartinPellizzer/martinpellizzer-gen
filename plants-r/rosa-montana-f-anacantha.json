    "intro": "Rosa montana f. anacantha, commonly known as the thorned shrub rose, is a compact, deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features upright, thorny stems and lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, semi-double pink to white flowers in late spring to early summer. It is well-suited for rock gardens or as a border plant due to its hardiness and ornamental value. Its botanical characteristics make it a popular choice for both ornamental gardening and horticultural research."
