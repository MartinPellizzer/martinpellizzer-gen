    "intro": "Rubus rivularis var. setulifer, commonly known as the hairy blackberry, is a perennial shrub native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its prickly stems and dark purple to black berries. The leaves are typically trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the plant thrives in moist, shaded environments. It produces small, white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by the development of its edible fruits. This variant is distinguished by its hairy texture on both the stems and leaves, which gives it its common name."
