    "intro": "Rubus sprengelii subsp. vallicularum, commonly known as the alpine raspberry, is a species of bramble native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or orange in color. The plant produces trifoliate leaves with serrated edges and has thorny stems typical of the Rubus genus. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
