    "intro": "Rosa viscaria var. serotina, commonly known as the late-flowering dog\u73ab\u7470, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and dark green, leathery leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety down. The plant produces fragrant, pink to red flowers that bloom late in the growing season, typically from late summer to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and long-lasting blooms."
