    "intro": "Ranunculus lacerescens, commonly known as the fringed buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the western United States. It features delicate, yellow flowers with deeply lobed petals that give it a distinctive, almost fern-like appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or stream banks. Its leaves are palmately divided and covered in fine, silky hairs. Ranunculus lacerescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
