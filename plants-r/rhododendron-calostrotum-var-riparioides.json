    "intro": "Rhododendron calostrotum var. riparioides, commonly known as the riverbank rhododendron, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments along riverbanks and forest edges. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, providing a striking contrast to its floral display. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in riparian habitats."
