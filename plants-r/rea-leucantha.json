    "intro": "Rea leucantha, commonly known as the white ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elongated, pendulous stems and large, pale green to white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insects, and it requires high humidity and indirect light to thrive. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Rea leucantha is considered endangered in its natural range."
