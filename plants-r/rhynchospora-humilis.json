    "intro": "Rhynchospora humilis, commonly known as the slender beak sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and related grass-like plants. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soil, often in marshy areas or along the edges of ponds and lakes. Its slender, grass-like stems are usually less than 30 cm tall, with small, triangular leaves. The flower heads are clustered at the tips of the stems, producing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers that contribute to its ecological role in wetland habitats."
