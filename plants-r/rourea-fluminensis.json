    "intro": "Rourea fluminensis, commonly known as the Amazonian rosewood, is a species of flowering plant in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly the Amazon basin. The plant is characterized by its evergreen leaves, which are typically elliptical and have a smooth or slightly serrated margin. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, often followed by capsule fruits. Rourea fluminensis is valued for its hard, dense wood, which is used in traditional crafts and musical instruments."
