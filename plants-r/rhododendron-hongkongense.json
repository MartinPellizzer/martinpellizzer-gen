    "intro": "Rhododendron hongkongense, commonly known as the Hong Kong rhododendron, is a species native to southern China and northern Vietnam. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters, featuring dense, leathery leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, pink to reddish-purple flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens. Due to its limited natural range, it is considered a rare and endangered species in the wild."
