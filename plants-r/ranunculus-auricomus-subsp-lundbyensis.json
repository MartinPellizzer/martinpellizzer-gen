    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus subsp. lundbyensis, commonly known as the Lundby's buttercup, is a rare and specialized subspecies native to specific regions of southern Scandinavia. It is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers with deeply lobed petals, typically arranged in a cup-like shape. The plant thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in wet meadows or along the edges of lakes. Its foliage consists of trifoliate leaves with serrated edges, and it blooms from late spring to early summer. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this subspecies is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
