    "intro": "Renggeria montana, commonly known as the mountain renggeria, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking violet to purple flowers, which bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or forested habitats, often at elevations above 2,000 meters. Its leaves are usually elongated and covered in a fine, velvety texture, which helps it retain moisture in its harsh environment. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Renggeria montana is considered a vulnerable species."
