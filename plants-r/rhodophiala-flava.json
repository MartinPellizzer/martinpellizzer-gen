    "intro": "Rhodophiala flava, commonly known as the golden lily, is a striking bulbous perennial plant native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is characterized by its vivid yellow flowers, which bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant features strap-like, grassy leaves that form a dense rosette near the ground. Its bulbs are adapted to store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in high-altitude, rocky environments. Rhodophiala flava is prized in horticulture for its ornamental value and unique coloration."
