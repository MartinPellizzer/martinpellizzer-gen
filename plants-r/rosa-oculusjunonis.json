It is characterized by its striking, deep red to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has dark green, glossy leaves and produces small, fragrant, pinkish-white fruits. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
