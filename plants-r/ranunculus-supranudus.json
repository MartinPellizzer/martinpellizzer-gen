    "intro": "Ranunculus supranudus, commonly known as the high alpine buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, lance-shaped leaves and its showy, yellow flowers with five petals. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. It produces small, green fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its specialized habitat, Ranunculus supranudus is considered a rare and ecologically important species in its native range."
