    "intro": "Rubus leucostachys, commonly known as the white-stemmed blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, often thornless stems and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically less flavorful compared to other Rubus species. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and thickets. Botanically, it is distinguished by its hairy leaves and the presence of stipules at the base of its leaflets."
