    "intro": "Rubus radula var. uncinatus, commonly known as the hooked blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and dark, almost black berries that ripen in late summer. The plant typically grows in woodland edges and disturbed soils, preferring partial shade to full sun. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the flowers are white with five petals. The fruit is edible, though often tart, and is used in jams and preserves."
