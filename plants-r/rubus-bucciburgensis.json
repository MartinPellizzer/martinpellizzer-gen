    "intro": "Rubus bucciburgensis, commonly known as the Bucciburg blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and large, dark purple to black berries that ripen in late summer. The plant thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in forested areas with well-drained soil. Its leaves are typically trifoliate, with a serrated margin and a slightly hairy surface. The fruit is valued for its intense flavor and is used both in local cuisines and for commercial production in certain regions."
