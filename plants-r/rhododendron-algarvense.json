It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows in rocky and limestone soils. The plant produces clusters of showy, pink to purple flowers in the spring. Its leaves are elliptical and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in its native habitat. Rhododendron algarvense is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
