    "intro": "Rosa canina villosula, commonly known as the hairy dog rose, is a shrub native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces aggregate fruits, known as rose hips, which are orange-red and contain numerous seeds. Rosa canina villosula is often found in woodland edges, hedgerows, and open areas with well-drained soil. Its hairy stems and leaves distinguish it from other rose species."
