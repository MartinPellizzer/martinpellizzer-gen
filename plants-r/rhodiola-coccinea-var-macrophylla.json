    "intro": "Rhodiola coccinea var. macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaved red rhodiola, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and large, bright red to orange flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has fleshy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, aiding in water retention in its arid environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its medicinal properties."
