    "intro": "Rosa urbica f. sphaerocarpa, commonly known as the spherical rose, is a botanical variant of the common dog\u73ab\u7470. It is characterized by its compact, rounded growth habit and smaller, more densely packed flowers compared to the typical Rosa urbica. The plant produces pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for urban gardens and rockeries. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in temperate climates."
