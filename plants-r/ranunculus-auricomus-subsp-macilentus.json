    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus subsp. macilentus, commonly known as the slenderleaf buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It features delicate, palmately divided leaves that are typically hairy and have a distinctive yellowish-green hue. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with five broadly ovate petals, often adorned with a prominent central boss. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and streambanks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
