    "intro": "Ranunculus repens var. tenuis, commonly known as the slender creeping buttercup, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features a mat-forming growth habit with slender, hairy stems that root at the nodes. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with five petal-like sepals, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in wet meadows, stream banks, and marshy areas. Its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively make it both a common weed and an ecologically significant species in its habitat."
