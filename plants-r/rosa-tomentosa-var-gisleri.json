    "intro": "Rosa tomentosa var. gisleri, commonly known as the Gisleri's woolly rose, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, grayish-white pubescent foliage and clusters of fragrant, pink to red flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Its stems are often covered in a thick layer of soft, woolly hairs, which provide insulation and protection against harsh weather. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with specific climate conditions."
