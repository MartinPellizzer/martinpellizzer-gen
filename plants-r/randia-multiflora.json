    "intro": "Randia multiflora, commonly known as the Florida hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring woody stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a yellow center. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies. Randia multiflora is also known for its ability to tolerate periodic flooding, making it a common sight in coastal and swampy areas."
