    "intro": "Rhynchospora corymbosa f. angustirostris, commonly known as the narrow-beaked spike-rush, is a flowering plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is a perennial herb characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and spike-like inflorescences. The inflorescence consists of small, usually greenish or brownish flowers arranged in dense clusters. This variety is distinguished by its narrow, elongated bracts, which give it the \"angustirostris\" designation, meaning \"narrow beak.\" It typically grows in wet or moist habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks."
