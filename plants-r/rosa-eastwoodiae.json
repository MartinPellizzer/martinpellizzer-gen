    "intro": "Rosa eastwoodiae, commonly known as Eastwood's rose, is a rare and endangered species native to the mountainous regions of central China. It is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to deep pink, often with a subtle red hue at the base. The plant has dark green, glossy leaves and thorny stems typical of many rose species. It thrives in cool, humid climates and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
