    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus subsp. dactylophylloides, commonly known as the golden buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and western Asia. It features distinctive yellow flowers with a large, showy center and deeply lobed petals. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges. Its leaves are palmately divided and covered in fine hairs, while the stems are usually hairy and somewhat succulent. The subspecies is characterized by its more robust growth and slightly larger flowers compared to the typical R. auricomus."
