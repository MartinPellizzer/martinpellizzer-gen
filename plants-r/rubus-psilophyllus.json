    "intro": "Rubus psilophyllus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved blackberry, is a species of bramble native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, thorned stems and small, dark green leaves with a distinctive narrow shape. The plant produces clusters of small, dark red berries that are typically harvested in late summer. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
