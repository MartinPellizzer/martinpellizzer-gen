    "intro": "Rotala leptopetala var. pentamera, commonly known as the spiked water hyssop, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It features whorled leaves that are typically oval to lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or violet in color, blooming during the summer months. It thrives in shallow freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense mats make it both a valuable aquatic plant and a potential invasive species in non-native habitats."
