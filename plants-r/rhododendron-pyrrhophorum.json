    "intro": "Rhododendron pyrrhophorum, commonly known as the red-tipped rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. It is characterized by its striking clusters of pink to reddish-purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows as an evergreen shrub, reaching heights of up to 3 meters, with leathery, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. Its flowers are tubular and are often visited by bees and other pollinators, contributing to its ecological importance in its native habitat. Rhododendron pyrrhophorum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in acidic, well-drained soils."
