    "intro": "Restrepia, commonly known as the orchid mantilla, is a genus of epiphytic orchids native to the Andes Mountains of South America. These plants are characterized by their delicate, lace-like foliage and showy, fragrant flowers that often bloom in clusters. Restrepia species typically grow on trees or rocks, relying on atmospheric moisture rather than soil for nutrients. Their flowers come in a variety of colors, including white, pink, and purple, and they are prized for their ornamental value. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, many Restrepia species are now considered endangered."
