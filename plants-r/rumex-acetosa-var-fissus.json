    "intro": "Rumex acetosa var. fissus, commonly known as narrowleaf sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features upright, branching stems with alternate, lance-shaped leaves that have a distinctive reddish or purple coloration on the veins. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in dense clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed areas. Its leaves are edible but contain oxalic acid, making them suitable for culinary use in moderation."
