    "intro": "Riocreuxia nepalensis, commonly known as the Nepal riocreuxia, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Melanthiaceae. It is a perennial herb characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate leaves and tall, slender flowering stems. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences. It is native to the Himalayan regions of Nepal and adjacent areas, typically growing in moist, shaded habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and less-studied species in botanical research."
