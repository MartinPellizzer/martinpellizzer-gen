It belongs to the Anacardiaceae family, which includes other plants like poison ivy and cashew. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often arranged in pairs along the stems. Its small, yellowish-green flowers appear in clusters and are followed by red, fuzzy berries that mature in the fall.
