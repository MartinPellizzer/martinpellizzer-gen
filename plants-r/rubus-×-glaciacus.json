    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 glaciacus, commonly known as the alpine raspberry, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Rubus chamaemorus and Rubus pedatus. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and production of small, red, edible berries. The plant typically thrives in cold climates and is often found in alpine and subarctic regions. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it has a woody stem that becomes more prominent with age. The berries are rich in antioxidants and are used both in traditional medicine and culinary applications."
