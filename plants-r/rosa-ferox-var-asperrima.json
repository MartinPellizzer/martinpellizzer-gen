    "intro": "Rosa ferox var. asperrima, commonly known as the rough bramble rose, is a rugged, thorny shrub native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, prickly growth and small, often hairy leaves that are adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments. The plant produces fragrant, pink to reddish flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its fruits are red, hairy rosehips that contain seeds and are an important food source for wildlife. Due to its hardy nature, it is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited to arid or semi-arid climates."
