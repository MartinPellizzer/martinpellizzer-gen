    "intro": "Reynosia ekmanii, commonly known as the coastal redwood, is a rare and endangered species native to the coastal regions of southern California. It is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its reddish-barked trunk and dense, evergreen foliage. The plant thrives in coastal scrub and chaparral habitats, where it is adapted to salty air and periodic drought. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are followed by unique, lantern-like seed pods that split open to release seeds. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
