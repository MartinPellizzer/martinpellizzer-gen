    "intro": "Rubus caesius var. rugulosus, commonly known as the rough-stemmed blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, rough-textured stems and foliage, which give it its scientific name \"rugulosus.\" The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically harvested in late summer. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland areas or along hedgerows. This variant is valued for its hardy nature and the flavor of its berries, though it is less commonly cultivated than other blackberry species."
