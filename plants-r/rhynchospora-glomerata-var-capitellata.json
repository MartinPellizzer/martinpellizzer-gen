    "intro": "Rhynchospora glomerata var. capitellata, commonly known as the clustered spike sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh habitats in the southeastern United States. It features a dense, spike-like inflorescence that is typically clustered at the top of the plant, giving it its specific epithet \"capitellata.\" The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, three-lobed flowers that are often pale green to reddish in color. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist soils. This variety is often found in association with other wetland plants, contributing to the ecological diversity of its habitat."
