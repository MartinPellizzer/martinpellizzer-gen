    "intro": "Rubus sulcatus f. paniculatus, commonly known as the paniculate blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces aggregate fruits composed of small, dark purple to black drupelets. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. This form is distinguished by its more open, paniculate inflorescence compared to the typical form of Rubus sulcatus."
