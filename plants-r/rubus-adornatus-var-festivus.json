    "intro": "Rubus adornatus var. festivus, commonly known as the festive everlet, is a deciduous shrub native to the temperate regions of the Pacific Northwest. It features slender, arching stems covered in dense, silvery-white hairs, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, edible berries that ripen to a deep red color in late summer. Its leaves are trifoliate, with lobed margins and a slightly serrated edge. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and streamside habitats."
