    "intro": "Rapanea coriacea, commonly known as the rough-leaved rapanea, is a species of flowering plant in the family Lauraceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly Madagascar, and is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are covered in a rough, waxy cuticle. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters. Its fruit is a small, elliptical drupe that contains a single seed. Rapanea coriacea is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role."
