It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or black in color. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
