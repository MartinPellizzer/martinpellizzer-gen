    "intro": "Rhexia resinosa, commonly known as the resinous bluemink, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and has a fibrous root system. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Rhexia resinosa is also notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
