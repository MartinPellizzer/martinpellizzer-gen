    "intro": "Rubus lejeunei var. atrovirens, commonly known as the blackberry bramble, is a variant of the Rubus genus native to certain regions of Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that ripen to a dark purple or black color, typical of many Rubus species. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland or shrubland habitats. Due to its ornamental and edible qualities, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and for foraging purposes."
