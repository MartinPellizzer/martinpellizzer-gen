    "intro": "Rubus minianus, commonly known as the creeping raspberry, is a species of shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or orange in color, which ripen in late summer. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the plant has a woody stem covered in fine hairs. Rubus minianus is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
