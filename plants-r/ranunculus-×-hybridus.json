    "intro": "Ranunculus \u00d7 hybridus, commonly known as the hybrid buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Ranunculaceae family. It is characterized by its showy, double or single-layered flowers that typically range in color from white to deep red, yellow, and orange. The plant features finely divided, trifoliate leaves that are alternate along the stem, and it produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into follicles containing seeds. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in some regions."
