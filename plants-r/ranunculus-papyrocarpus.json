    "intro": "Ranunculus papyrocarpus, commonly known as the giant buttercup, is a herbaceous plant native to the high-altitude regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, showy yellow flowers with numerous petals and a central cluster of stamens. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as cloud forests and mountain meadows. Its leaves are palmately divided and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant floral display."
