    "intro": "Ribeirea elliptica, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical tree native to South America. It is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood, which is highly valued for its tonal qualities in musical instruments. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and often have a glossy surface. It produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by small, round fruits. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species and is protected in many regions."
