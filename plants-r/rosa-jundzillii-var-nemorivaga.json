    "intro": "Rosa jundzillii var. nemorivaga, commonly known as the forest rose, is a shrub-like species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and dense, thorny stems that support its clusters of fragrant, semi-double pink flowers. The plant produces elliptical, glossy leaves with serrated edges, typical of many rose species. It thrives in well-drained, loamy soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its beauty and hardiness."
