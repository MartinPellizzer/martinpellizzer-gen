    "intro": "Ramona polystachya, commonly known as the silky bract grass, is a perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and pond edges, where it thrives in moist to aquatic conditions. Its flowering period occurs from late spring to early summer, and it plays a role in supporting local wildlife by providing nectar for pollinators. The plant's ornamental value has led to its cultivation in wetland restoration projects and botanical gardens."
