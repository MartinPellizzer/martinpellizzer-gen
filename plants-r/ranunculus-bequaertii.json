    "intro": "Ranunculus bequaertii, commonly known as the Bequaert's buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It features delicate, palmately divided leaves and bright yellow flowers with prominent, showy sepals. The plant typically grows in alpine or subalpine habitats, thriving in well-drained, rocky soils. It is characterized by its short stature and is often found in high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
