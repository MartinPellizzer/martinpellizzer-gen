    "intro": "Rostellularia latispica, commonly known as the broad-spined rostellularia, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, spiny calyces that enclose its small, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous perennial, often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Its leaves are usually opposite, ovate, and covered with a dense layer of fine hairs. The flowers, which are typically pink or purple, bloom in clusters and are adapted for pollination by small insects."
