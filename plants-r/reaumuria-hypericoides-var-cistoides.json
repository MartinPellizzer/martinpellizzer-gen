    "intro": "Reaumuria hypericoides var. cistoides, commonly known as the coastal buckthorn, is a shrub native to arid and coastal regions of western North America. It is characterized by its low, spreading growth habit and small, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are followed by small, berry-like fruits. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to salt spray and strong winds. This species plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife."
