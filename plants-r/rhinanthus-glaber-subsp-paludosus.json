    "intro": "Rhinanthus glaber subsp. paludosus, commonly known as the marsh toadflax, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wet meadows and marshy areas in Europe. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers that bloom from June to August. The plant has a slender, branching stem and produces small, tubular flowers that are often clustered in the upper part of the stem. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on other plants for nutrients through its root system. Its ecological importance lies in its role as a food source for various pollinators and its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils."
