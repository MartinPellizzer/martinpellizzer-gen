It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and the production of edible red berries. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and along forest edges, preferring moist and shaded environments. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated margins, and its flowers are white with five petals. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
