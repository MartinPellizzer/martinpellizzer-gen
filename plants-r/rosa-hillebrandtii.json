    "intro": "Rosa hillebrandtii, commonly known as the Hillebrandt's rose, is a species of shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and clusters of fragrant, semi-double pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters and has dark green, ovate leaves with serrated edges. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. Rosa hillebrandtii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also noted for its hardiness in colder climates."
