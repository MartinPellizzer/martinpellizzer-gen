    "intro": "Rumex \u00d7 mixtus, commonly known as the hybrid sorrel, is a perennial plant that results from the cross between Rumex acetosa (common sorrel) and Rumex acetobulus (broadleaf sorrel). It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often reddish in color, especially along the veins. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on tall, upright stems. It thrives in moist, fertile soils and is often found in wetlands, along stream banks, and in disturbed areas. Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits a mix of traits from both parent species, making it a unique example of natural hybridization in the Polygonaceae family."
