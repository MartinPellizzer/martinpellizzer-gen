    "intro": "Regelia velutina, commonly known as the velvet regelia, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup. The leaves are thick, waxy, and covered in a fine, velvety pubescence, which helps in moisture retention. It produces vibrant orange or red flowers that bloom in late summer or early autumn. This plant thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining soil to flourish."
