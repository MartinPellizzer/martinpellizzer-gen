    "intro": "Ranunculus dielsianus var. suprasericeus, commonly known as the Diels' buttercup, is a flowering plant native to the high Andes of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, yellow flowers with five petals and a hairy stem. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky habitats at high elevations. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the flowers bloom in early spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
