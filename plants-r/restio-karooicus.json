It belongs to the Restionaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and unbranched stems. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Restio karooicus produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny white or pale blue flowers.
