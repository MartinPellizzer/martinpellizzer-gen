    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus subsp. acutulans, commonly known as the sharp-leaved buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It features basal leaves that are deeply lobed and often have a waxy coating, while its stems are usually hairy. The plant produces showy yellow flowers with five broadly spreading sepals, which are often mistaken for petals. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in some regions."
