    "intro": "Rubus schleicheri var. albicolus, commonly known as the white-flowered bramble, is a variant of the Rubus genus native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its pale yellow to white flowers, which contrast with its dark green foliage. The plant typically grows as a shrub, with thorny stems and serrated leaves. Its fruits, though not widely cultivated, are edible and similar in taste to other Rubus species. This variant is of interest to botanists due to its unique floral coloration and potential ecological role in its native habitat."
