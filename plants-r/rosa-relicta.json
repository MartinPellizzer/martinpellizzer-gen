    "intro": "Rosa relicta, commonly known as the relic rose, is a rare and ancient species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its fragrant, pale pink to white flowers and thorny stems, typical of many rose species. The plant is adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments, thriving in well-drained soils and cool climates. Its leaves are simple and alternate, with finely serrated margins, and its fruits are small, aggregate berries. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Rosa relicta is considered a conservation concern."
