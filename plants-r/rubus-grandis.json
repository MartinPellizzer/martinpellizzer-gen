    "intro": "Rubus grandis, commonly known as the large raspberry, is a species of brambles native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces aggregate fruits, known as berries, which are typically red when mature. These berries are edible, though often tart, and are used in culinary applications. Rubus grandis thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
