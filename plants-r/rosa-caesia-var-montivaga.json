    "intro": "Rosa caesia var. montivaga, commonly known as the alpine rose, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss in its alpine habitat. Rosa caesia var. montivaga is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and hardy nature."
