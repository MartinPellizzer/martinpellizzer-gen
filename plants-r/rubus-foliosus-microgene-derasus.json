    "intro": "Rubus foliosus microgene derasus, commonly known as the microgene dewberry, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and small, trifoliate leaves. The plant produces clusters of white to pale pink flowers, which are followed by edible, red berries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
