    "intro": "Rosa tomentosa var. leiocarpa, commonly known as the soft-hairy rose, is a shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its densely hairy stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, woolly appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink to white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its foliage is usually dark green and slightly serrated, and it thrives in partial shade to full sun. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
