    "intro": "Ranunculus cortusifolius var. maroccanus, commonly known as the Moroccan crowfoot, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Morocco. It features delicate, palmate leaves with a distinctive lobed shape and bright yellow, cup-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its foliage is often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which helps reduce water loss. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its unique floral display."
