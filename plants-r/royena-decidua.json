    "intro": "Royena decidua, commonly known as the deciduous royal fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its large, compound fronds that are typically deciduous, shedding in seasonal changes. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that help in vegetative propagation. Its leaves are pinnately divided, with a distinctive appearance that makes it easily recognizable. Royena decidua thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
