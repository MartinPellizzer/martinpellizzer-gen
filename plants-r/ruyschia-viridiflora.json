    "intro": "Ruyschia viridiflora, commonly known as the green-flowered ruyschia, is a striking member of the Araceae family native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, arrow-shaped leaves that are often a deep green with a waxy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, pale green flowers that are surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. Its unique foliage and unusual floral display make it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Ruyschia viridiflora thrives in humid, bright indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
