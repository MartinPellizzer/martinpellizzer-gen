    "intro": "Rhodamnia australis, commonly known as the Australian rosewood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to eastern Australia. It belongs to the family Myrtaceae, which includes eucalyptus and tea trees, and is characterized by its aromatic foliage and showy flowers. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to red flowers that bloom in spring, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its bark is smooth and often fissured, while its leaves are elliptical, glossy, and have a distinct aromatic scent when crushed. Rhodamnia australis is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in horticulture for its hardiness and adaptability."
