    "intro": "Ranunculus nemorosus subsp. serpens, commonly known as the creeping water buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three deeply lobed segments, and it produces yellow flowers with five petals. The subspecies is distinguished by its more elongated and less showy flowers compared to the typical R. nemorosus."
