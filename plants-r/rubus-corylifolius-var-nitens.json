    "intro": "Rubus corylifolius var. nitens, commonly known as the glossy blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery leaves that are glossy and dark green in color. The plant produces dark purple to black berries that are typically larger than those of other Rubus species. These berries are often used in traditional medicine and as a food source. Its botanical features make it distinct within the Rubus genus, particularly due to its unique leaf and fruit morphology."
