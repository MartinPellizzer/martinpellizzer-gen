    "intro": "Robertsonia davurica, commonly known as the Siberian bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the cold climates of Siberia and northern China. It features a rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces striking blue to violet flowers in late summer, which are clustered in terminal racemes. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or loamy soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in colder regions."
