    "intro": "Rubus devitatus, commonly known as the ghost raspberry, is a rare and elusive species of bramble native to the temperate regions of North America. It is characterized by its delicate, pale pink flowers and small, edible berries that are often overlooked due to their subtle flavor. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist woodland areas, where it thrives in the understory of dense forest canopies. Its leaves are trifoliate, with finely serrated edges, and its stems are covered in fine, almost invisible hairs. Due to its rarity and unique appearance, Rubus devitatus is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
