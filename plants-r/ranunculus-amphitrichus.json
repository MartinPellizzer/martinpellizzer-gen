    "intro": "Ranunculus amphitrichus, commonly known as the Sierra larkspur, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its showy, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has palmate leaves with a hairy underside, and its stems are typically upright and branched. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along streambanks. Due to its beauty and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it is considered a wildflower in its native habitat."
