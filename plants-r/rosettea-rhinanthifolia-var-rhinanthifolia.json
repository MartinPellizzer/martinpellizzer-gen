    "intro": "Rosettea rhinanthifolia var. rhinanthifolia, commonly known as the red-flowered rosette, is a striking member of the Acanthaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, compact rosette of fleshy, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are typically red or orange, with two lips that are prominent in appearance. These flowers are borne on slender, branching inflorescences and attract a variety of pollinators, including bees and hummingbirds. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions and thrives in well-drained, sandy soils."
