    "intro": "Rubus dumetorum subf. latifoliatus, commonly known as the broad-leaf blackberry, is a species of brambles native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its trailing or climbing growth habit and produces aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black in color. The leaves are broad and lobed, with a rough texture and a distinctive aroma when crushed. This sub-species is often found in disturbed soils and along woodland edges, where it thrives in partial shade. Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and a valuable plant for foraging and horticultural purposes."
