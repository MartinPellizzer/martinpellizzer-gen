    "intro": "Robinia bullata, commonly known as the white robinia or bullata acacia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and often have a soft, feathery appearance. The plant produces fragrant, yellowish-white flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by long, flat seed pods. Its bark is smooth and grayish, with a distinctive flaky texture that peels in thin layers. Robinia bullata is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in open woodlands and along stream banks."
