    "intro": "Restrepia teaguei, commonly known as the Teague's restrepia, is a terrestrial orchid native to the humid forests of Mexico. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its sympodial growth habit, producing new shoots from the base of the previous growth. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers with a distinctive lip. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and requires well-drained, humus-rich soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
