    "intro": "Ramirezella ornata, commonly known as the golden star orchid, is a rare and delicate epiphytic orchid native to the cloud forests of Central America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking golden-yellow flowers that bloom in late winter. The plant has thin, wiry roots that help it cling to tree bark, and its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped. It thrives in humid, shaded environments with high air circulation. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires careful conservation efforts."
