    "intro": "Rhaphidophora oblongifolia, commonly known as the oblong-leaf staghorn fern, is a tropical epiphytic plant native to Southeast Asia. It features a compact, tree-like structure with a central caudex and multiple fiddlehead-like offshoots. The plant has broad, waxy, and leathery leaves that are typically dark green with a glossy texture. It thrives in humid environments with indirect light and requires well-draining potting media. Rhaphidophora oblongifolia is popular in indoor gardening due to its ornamental appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
