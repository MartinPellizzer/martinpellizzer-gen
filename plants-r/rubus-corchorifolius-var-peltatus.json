It is characterized by its peltate leaves, which have a central vein that is raised and appears to be attached to the leaf surface at a single point. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits known as drupes, which are typically red or yellow when mature. It is native to East Asia, particularly Japan, and thrives in temperate climates. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
