    "intro": "Rosa uncinella, commonly known as the bent-thorn rose, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and small, fragrant pink or white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces oval, green leaves with serrated edges, and its fruits are red, hairy rosehips that contain seeds. Rosa uncinella thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often growing in woodland edges or rocky habitats. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal medicine."
