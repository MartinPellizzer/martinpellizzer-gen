    "intro": "Ritchiea bussei, commonly known as the Bornean pitcher plant, is a rare carnivorous plant native to the rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the Nepenthaceae family and is characterized by its unique, modified leaves that form deep, pitcher-shaped structures. These pitchers secrete a sticky fluid that traps insects, which are then digested by enzymes to provide essential nutrients. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of atmospheric moisture. Its conservation status is threatened due to habitat loss and illegal collection."
