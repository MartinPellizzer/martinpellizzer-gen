It is characterized by its thorny stems, trifoliate leaves, and aggregate fruits that mature into dark purple to black berries. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, and they appear in clusters. The fruit is edible, though often tart, and is used in jams and culinary applications."
