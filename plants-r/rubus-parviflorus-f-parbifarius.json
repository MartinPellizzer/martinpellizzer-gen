    "intro": "Rubus parviflorus f. parbifarius, commonly known as the narrow-leaved blackberry, is a variant of the common blackberry species. It is a shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States, characterized by its slender, thorny stems and small, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, dark purple berries that are typically less showy than those of the typical blackberry. Botanically, it is distinguished by its reduced floral structure and the presence of double leaflets in its foliage. This form is often found in moist, shady environments, thriving in forest understories."
