    "intro": "Rumex scutatus var. scoparius, commonly known as the narrow-leaved dock, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, often calcareous soils, such as those found in meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks. The plant features lance-shaped, serrated leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its small, greenish flowers are clustered in dense, terminal spikes, and it produces capsule fruits containing numerous tiny seeds. This species is valued for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally in herbal remedies."
