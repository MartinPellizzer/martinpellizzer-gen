    "intro": "Ramium niveum, commonly known as the white clover, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and Africa. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, each composed of three oval-shaped leaflets with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early autumn. Ramium niveum thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed areas. It is a valuable plant for soil nitrogen fixation and is commonly used as forage for livestock."
