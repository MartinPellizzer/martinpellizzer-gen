    "intro": "Racosperma graniticola, commonly known as the granite acacia, is a shrub native to the arid regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, wiry foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in clusters. The plant is adapted to harsh, rocky environments, with deep root systems that allow it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. Its leaves are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in hot, dry conditions. Racosperma graniticola plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native wildlife."
