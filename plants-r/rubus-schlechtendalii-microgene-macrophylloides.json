    "intro": "Rubus schlechtendalii microgene macrophylloides, commonly known as the large-leafed blackberry, is a species of brambles native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its large, elliptical leaves that are often hairy on the underside, and its dark purple to black berries that mature in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories or along stream banks. Its flowers are small and white, arranged in clusters, and it produces a distinctive, aromatic scent. The plant is valued for its edible fruits and its role in local ecosystems."
