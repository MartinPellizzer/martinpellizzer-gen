    "intro": "Rubus karstianus, commonly known as the Karst raspberry, is a species of bramble native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, aggregate fruits. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone-rich soils, thriving in mountainous regions. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, and the fruits are edible, though they are not as widely cultivated as other raspberry species. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered plant in many areas."
