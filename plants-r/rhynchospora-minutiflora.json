    "intro": "Rhynchospora minutiflora, commonly known as the small-flowered beakviolet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and other moist habitats, often forming dense colonies. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, violet-colored flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its inflorescence is a spike of short, clustered flowers, which are often hidden among the foliage. Rhynchospora minutiflora is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its aesthetic appeal in wetland restoration projects."
