    "intro": "Rhynchelythrum minutiflorum var. melinioides, commonly known as the small-flowered rhynchelythrum, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands. The plant features slender, branching stems with finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers are clustered in umbrella-shaped clusters, which attract various pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
