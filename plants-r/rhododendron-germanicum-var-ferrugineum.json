    "intro": "Rhododendron germanicum var. ferrugineum, commonly known as the rusty-leaved rhododendron, is a compact evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It features dense, leathery leaves that are dark green on top and covered with a distinctive rusty-red tomentum underneath. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, pinkish-white flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardy nature in cooler climates."
