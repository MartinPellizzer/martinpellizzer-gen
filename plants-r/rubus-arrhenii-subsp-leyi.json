It is characterized by its thorny stems and small, clustered flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant produces red or purple berries that are edible but often tart in flavor. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is commonly found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its limited range, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
