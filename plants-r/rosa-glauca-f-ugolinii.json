    "intro": "Rosa glauca f. ugolinii, commonly known as the Ugolinii form of the blue rose, is a rare and ornamental variant of the Rosa glauca species. It is characterized by its striking blue-pink flowers, which are a result of a unique pigmentation caused by the presence of delphinidin. This form is typically found in alpine or subalpine regions, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a silvery-blue underside, adding to its visual appeal. Due to its limited distribution and delicate nature, it is often cultivated in specialized gardens and botanical collections."
