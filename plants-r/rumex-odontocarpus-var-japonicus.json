    "intro": "Rumex odontocarpus var. japonicus, commonly known as Japanese dock, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to East Asia. It belongs to the Polygonaceae family and is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves with a distinctive reddish midrib. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are typically borne on slender, erect stalks. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a common weed in disturbed soils."
