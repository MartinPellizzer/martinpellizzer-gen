    "intro": "Rindera glastifolia, commonly known as the broad-leafed rindera, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its large, palmate leaves. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, hairy seeds, aiding in wind dispersal. Rindera glastifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique foliage and floral display."
