    "intro": "Ranunculus montanus subsp. pseudomontanus, commonly known as the alpine buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky soils at high elevations, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant features showy yellow flowers with five to eight petals, and its leaves are palmately divided into three to five lobes. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and is often found in open, sunlit habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
