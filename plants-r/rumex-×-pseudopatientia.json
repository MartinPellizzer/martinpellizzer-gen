    "intro": "Rumex \u00d7 pseudopatientia, commonly known as the hybrid sorrel, is a perennial plant belonging to the Polygonaceae family. It is a naturally occurring hybrid between Rumex acetosa (common sorrel) and Rumex patientia (arrow-leaved sorrel). The plant features heart-shaped leaves with a serrated margin and a distinctive reddish coloration on the veins. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its edible leaves are used in culinary applications, though they contain oxalic acid and should be consumed in moderation."
