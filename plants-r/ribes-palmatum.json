    "intro": "Ribes palmatum, commonly known as the Japanese gooseberry, is a deciduous shrub native to East Asia. It is characterized by its palmately lobed leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by edible berries that ripen to a bright red color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Ribes palmatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
