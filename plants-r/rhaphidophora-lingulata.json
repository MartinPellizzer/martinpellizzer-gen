It is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The plant is characterized by its unique, waxy, and often zigzag-shaped leaves that give it its common name. It typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees or other structures in its natural habitat. Rhaphidophora lingulata prefers bright, indirect light and consistent humidity, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
