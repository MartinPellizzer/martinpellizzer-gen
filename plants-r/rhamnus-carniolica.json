    "intro": "Rhamnus carniolica, commonly known as the Carpathian buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to the Balkans and parts of Eastern Europe. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in forest edges or open woodlands. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by dark blue berries that are edible for birds and some mammals. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a serrated edge, while its bark is smooth and grayish in color. Rhamnus carniolica is valued for its ornamental qualities and plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food and habitat for wildlife."
