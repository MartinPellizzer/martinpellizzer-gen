It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically edible. Its flowers are white and clustered in dense inflorescences, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. This variety is notable for its glandular structures on the fruit surface, which contribute to its distinct appearance and potential medicinal properties."
