    "intro": "Rohdea longipedunculata, commonly known as the Chinese lily or long-peduncled rohdea, is a herbaceous plant native to Southeast Asia. It features a rosette of narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces tall, slender flowering stalks that bear small, white or pale pink flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value lies in its striking foliage and delicate floral display."
