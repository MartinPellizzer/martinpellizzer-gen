    "intro": "Rhinanthus aristatus subvar. pseudolanceolatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved common toadflax, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers and slender, lance-shaped leaves. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients through its root system. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and heathlands. This subspecies is distinguished by its narrower leaves compared to the typical form of Rhinanthus aristatus."
