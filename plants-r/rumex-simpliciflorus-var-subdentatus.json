It typically grows in moist soils along stream banks and in wet meadows. The plant features lance-shaped leaves with smooth margins, distinguishing it from other dock species. Its flowers are small and clustered in loose inflorescences, often with reddish bracts. It is valued in traditional medicine for its astringent properties and is also used as a forage plant for livestock."
