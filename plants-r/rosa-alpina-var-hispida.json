    "intro": "Rosa alpina var. hispida, commonly known as the Alpine rose or mountain rose, is a perennial shrub native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and fragrant, pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are alternate, simple, and covered with fine, glandular hairs that give them a slightly sticky texture. Its stems are woody and often bear thorns, which are typical of many rose species. This plant thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments."
