    "intro": "Rubus horridus var. koeleri, commonly known as the Koeler's bramble, is a shrub native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, white to pink flowers that bloom in summer, followed by red or black berries. It thrives in woodland edges and disturbed soils, preferring partial shade to full sun. Its berries are edible but have a tart flavor, often used in jams and pies."
