    "intro": "Ravenia ruellioides, commonly known as the red sandalwood or African ravenia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Fabaceae, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant is notable for its hard, dark wood, which has been historically valued for its density and rich color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and rocky habitats. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered endangered in some regions."
