    "intro": "Reutera intermedia, commonly known as the New Zealand tree fern, is a striking evergreen plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Cyatheaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of large, feathery fronds. The plant can grow up to 10 meters in height, with a slow growth rate that makes it a long-lived species. Its roots form a dense network that helps stabilize the soil, and its fronds are used in traditional M\u0101ori crafts. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in native forests."
