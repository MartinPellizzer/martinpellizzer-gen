    "intro": "Rosa tomentella var. discosa, commonly known as the woolly rose, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, white to grayish pubescent foliage and small, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or white. The plant produces oval, yellowish fruits called hips, which are edible and often used in herbal teas. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in temperate climates."
