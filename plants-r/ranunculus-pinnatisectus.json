    "intro": "Ranunculus pinnatisectus, commonly known as the finely divided buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features delicate, palmately lobed leaves that are finely dissected, giving it a feathery appearance. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with numerous stamens, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain environments."
