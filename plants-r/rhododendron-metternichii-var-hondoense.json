    "intro": "Rhododendron metternichii var. hondoense, commonly known as the Hondo rhododendron, is a compact evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Japan. It features dense, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and glossy, providing a striking backdrop for its showy floral display. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, fragrant flowers in shades of pink to purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and requires partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and long-lasting blooms."
