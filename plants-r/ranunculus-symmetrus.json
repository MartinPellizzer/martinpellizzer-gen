    "intro": "Ranunculus symmetrus, commonly known as the symmetrical buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features delicate, showy flowers with five to seven sepals that resemble petals, often in shades of yellow or orange. The plant has a short, stout stem with basal leaves that are trifoliate, meaning they are divided into three parts. Its flowers typically bloom in spring, and it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its bright, cheerful blossoms."
