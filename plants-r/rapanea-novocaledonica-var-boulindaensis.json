    "intro": "Rapanea novocaledonica var. boulindaensis, commonly known as the Boulinda rapanea, is a rare evergreen shrub native to the island of New Caledonia. It belongs to the family Lauraceae, which includes laurels and cinnamon trees. The plant is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruit is a small, round drupe that turns from green to red as it matures. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
