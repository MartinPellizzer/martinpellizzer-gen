    "intro": "Rubus choachiensis, commonly known as the Choachi blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves, typical of the Rubus genus. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are usually dark purple to black in color. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and partial shade. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and less-studied species within its genus."
