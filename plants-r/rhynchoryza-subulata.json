It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spike-like clusters. Rhynchoryza subulata is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and its ability to thrive in moist to water-saturated soils. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
