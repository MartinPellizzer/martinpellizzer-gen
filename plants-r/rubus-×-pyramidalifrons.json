    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 pyramidalifrons, commonly known as the pyramidal blackberry, is a hybrid species within the Rubus genus, characterized by its thorny stems and aggregate fruits. It is native to the eastern United States and thrives in moist, well-drained soils, often found in woodland edges and thickets. The plant produces dark purple to black berries that are typically small and edible, though they may have a tart flavor. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the plant exhibits a shrub-like growth habit. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and for local foraging."
