    "intro": "Ritchiea gigantocarpa, commonly known as the giant carapa, is a rare and striking member of the Arecaceae family. It is native to the rainforests of northern Queensland, Australia, and is characterized by its massive, buttressed trunk and broad, fan-shaped leaves. The plant produces large, showy inflorescences with yellow flowers that attract various pollinators. Its fruit is a hard, woody capsule that contains several seeds. Due to its rarity and ecological significance, it is highly valued in botanical conservation efforts."
