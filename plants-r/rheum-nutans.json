    "intro": "Rheum nutans, commonly known as the nodding rhubarb, is a perennial plant native to the Himalayas. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant produces tall, branched stems with clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. Its rhubarb-like stems are edible, though they are typically less tart than those of other rhubarb species. Rheum nutans is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has been used in traditional medicine."
