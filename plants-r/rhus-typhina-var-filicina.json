    "intro": "Rhus typhina var. filicina, commonly known as the silky rush-leaf sumac, is a variant of the staghorn sumac characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves. It is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America, typically found in moist, open habitats such as stream banks and woodland edges. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers in spring, which are followed by red, fuzzy berries in the fall. Its foliage is often more delicate and lacy compared to the typical sumac, giving it a unique appearance. The botanical features of this variant make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
