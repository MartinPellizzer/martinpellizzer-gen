It is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States, typically found in moist, shaded woodlands. The leaves are broadly ovate with a glossy, waxy surface that gives them a bluish-gray appearance. The flowers are small, white, and clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by dark purple to black berries. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and contributes to local biodiversity by providing food for wildlife."
