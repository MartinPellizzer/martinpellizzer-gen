    "intro": "Ruehssia astephanoides, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically velvety to the touch. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in spikes, often followed by winged fruits. It thrives in warm, humid environments and is often found in moist lowland areas. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is considered a weed in many regions where it is introduced."
