    "intro": "Ranunculus linearifidus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features delicate, cup-shaped flowers with 5 to 15 sepals that are usually yellow or white, often with a greenish tint. The plant has finely divided, linear leaves that give it a feathery appearance, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It is typically found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it blooms from late spring to early summer. The species is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate, daisy-like flowers."
