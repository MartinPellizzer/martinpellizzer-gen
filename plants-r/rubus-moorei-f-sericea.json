    "intro": "Rubus moorei f. sericea, commonly known as the silverleaf raspberry, is a variant of the Rubus genus native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its silvery-white, woolly undersides on its leaves, which give it its distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, red berries that are typically edible but not as commonly consumed as other raspberry varieties. It thrives in damp, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and unique foliage, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
