    "intro": "Ranunculus hawaiensis, commonly known as the Hawaiian buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the Hawaiian Islands. It features delicate, showy flowers with five to seven white petals and a yellow center, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has finely divided, trifoliate leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of soft, white hairs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
