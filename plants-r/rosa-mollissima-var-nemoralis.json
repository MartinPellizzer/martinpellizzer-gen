    "intro": "Rosa mollissima var. nemoralis, commonly known as the soft-hairy rose, is a shrub-like species native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, fuzzy foliage and small, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in woodland or shaded areas, preferring moist, well-drained soils. Its leaves are compound, with oval, serrated leaflets that are covered in fine, soft hairs. This variety is often used in ornamental gardening for its aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in semi-shaded conditions."
