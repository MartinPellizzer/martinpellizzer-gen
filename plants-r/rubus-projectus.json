    "intro": "Rubus projectus, commonly known as the spreading blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is a shrub characterized by its woody stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces aggregate fruits, known as berries, which are typically dark purple to black in color. These berries are edible, though they are often tart and require sweetening for consumption. Rubus projectus thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forests and along stream banks."
