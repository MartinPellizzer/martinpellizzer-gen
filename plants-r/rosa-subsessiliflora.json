    "intro": "Rosa subsessiliflora, commonly known as the sessile-leaved rose, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America, where it thrives in temperate climates. The plant is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of fragrant, pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring. Its leaves are typically sessile, meaning they lack stalks, and are arranged alternately along the stems. Rosa subsessiliflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic beauty."
