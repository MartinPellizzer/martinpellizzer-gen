    "intro": "Rosa canina var. arezzensis, commonly known as the Arezzan dog rose, is a rare variant of the dog rose native to central Italy. It is characterized by its pale pink to white flowers and thorny stems, typical of the Rosa canina species. The plant produces small, red, edible hips that are rich in vitamin C. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or arid environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a botanical curiosity and is of interest to horticulturists and conservationists."
