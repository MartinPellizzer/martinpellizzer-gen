    "intro": "Rhynchanthera humilis, commonly known as the dwarf orchid, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rainforests and undergrowth. The plant has slender, hairy stems and produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow. Its roots are often mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with fungi to enhance nutrient absorption. Rhynchanthera humilis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens."
