    "intro": "Roegneria glaberrima var. breviarista, commonly known as the short-stemmed wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and fine, blue-green foliage. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and prairie habitats. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is sometimes cultivated in native plant gardens."
