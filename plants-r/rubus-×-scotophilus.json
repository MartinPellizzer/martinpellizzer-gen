It is characterized by its thorny stems and aggregate fruits, which are typically dark purple to black in color. The plant thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges and moist soils. Its flowers are white or pale yellow, and it produces edible berries that are rich in antioxidants. The species is valued both for its ornamental qualities and its potential in culinary and medicinal applications."
