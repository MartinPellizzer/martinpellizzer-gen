    "intro": "Rosa roseomoyesii, commonly known as the pink-stemmed rose, is a rare and ornamental shrub native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its slender, woody stems that display a distinctive pinkish hue, particularly during the growing season. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white to pale pink, typically blooming in late spring. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its unique appearance. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Rosa roseomoyesii is considered a botanical curiosity and is often cultivated for its aesthetic value in specialized gardens."
