    "intro": "Rubus fastigiatus, commonly known as the upright blackberry shrub, is a species of brambles native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit, with arching, thorny stems that can reach heights of up to 3 meters. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black in color, similar to other Rubus species. Its leaves are alternate, with serrated edges and a slightly hairy surface. This plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in woodland edges and moist soils."
