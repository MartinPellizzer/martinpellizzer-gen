    "intro": "Rosa virginiana f. innoxia, commonly known as the Virgin's bower or sweet brier, is a flowering plant native to eastern North America. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring thorny stems and compound leaves with 5 to 7 leaflets. The plant produces fragrant, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a red, hairy capsule that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. This variety is characterized by its smaller, more compact growth compared to the typical Rosa virginiana."
