    "intro": "Rubus trilobus, commonly known as the three-lobed blackberry, is a species of brambles native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with three distinct lobes. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black when mature. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and thickets. Rubus trilobus is often found growing in clusters, forming dense thickets that can dominate understory vegetation."
