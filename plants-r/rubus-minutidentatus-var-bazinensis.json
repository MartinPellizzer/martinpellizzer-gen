    "intro": "Rubus minutidentatus var. bazinensis, commonly known as the Batin's dwarf raspberry, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, thorny stems and trifoliate leaves with finely serrated margins. The plant produces small, red berries that ripen in late summer, which are edible but often described as having a tart flavor. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and prefers partial to full sunlight. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and locally endemic species."
