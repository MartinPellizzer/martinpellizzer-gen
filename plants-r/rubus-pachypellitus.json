    "intro": "Rubus pachypellitus, commonly known as the thick-leaved blackberry, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is native to eastern Asia, particularly China, where it thrives in temperate climates. The plant is characterized by its large, dark green, leathery leaves and produces small, dark purple berries that are edible. It is often found in forest understories and along stream banks, where it forms dense thickets. The thick, waxy leaf cuticle of Rubus pachypellitus helps it retain moisture in its native habitat."
