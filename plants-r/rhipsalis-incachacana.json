    "intro": "Rhipsalis incachacana, commonly known as the Andean mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its soft, leafy stems that often hang in clusters. The plant lacks true leaves and instead has scale-like structures that perform photosynthesis. It relies on host trees for water and nutrients, while still carrying out some photosynthesis itself. Rhipsalis incachacana is often found in humid, shaded environments within cloud forests."
