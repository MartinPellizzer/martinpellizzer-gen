    "intro": "Reimaria diffusa, commonly known as the broadleaf reindeer lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in cool, moist environments. It features a dense, leaf-like thallus with a dark green to black upper surface and a white to yellowish lower surface. The plant is composed of a symbiotic association between a fungus and green algae or cyanobacteria. It is often found on tree trunks and rocks in temperate forests. Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes, it serves as an indicator of ecological health."
