    "intro": "Rhus toxicodendron var. eximia, commonly known as smooth sumac, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged with 11 to 31 leaflets, and its distinctive red, fuzzy fruit clusters that appear in the fall. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in the spring, which are clustered in upright panicles. Smooth sumac is adapted to a variety of soil types and thrives in full sun, making it a common sight in woodlands and disturbed areas. Its botanical features make it easily identifiable and ecologically significant in its native habitat."
