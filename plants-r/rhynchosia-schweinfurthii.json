    "intro": "Rhynchosia schweinfurthii, commonly known as the African velvet bean, is a climbing legume native to tropical Africa. It features compound leaves with three to five elliptical leaflets and produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that are often clustered in racemes. The plant bears pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are used in traditional medicine and as a food source. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed habitats such as fallow fields and along riverbanks. Rhynchosia schweinfurthii is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it an important plant in agroforestry systems."
