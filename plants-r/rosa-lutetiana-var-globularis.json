    "intro": "Rosa lutetiana var. globularis, commonly known as the Globe Rose, is a compact, shrub-like rose native to Europe. It features dense, rounded growth with small, dark green leaves and produces fragrant, pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is characterized by its unique spherical shape, which results from its tightly packed, thornless stems. It is well-suited for container gardening and small spaces due to its compact form. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ease of care in moderate climates."
