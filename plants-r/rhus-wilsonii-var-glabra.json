It is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and compound leaves that are pinnately arranged with serrated leaflets. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, fuzzy fruit clusters in the fall. Smooth sumac is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in open woods, fields, and along roadsides. It plays an important role in supporting local wildlife, providing food and habitat for various insects and birds."
