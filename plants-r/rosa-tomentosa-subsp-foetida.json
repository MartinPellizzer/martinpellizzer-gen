    "intro": "Rosa tomentosa subsp. foetida, commonly known as the stink rose, is a shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and small, often fragrant flowers. The plant produces red or pink flowers that bloom in the spring, and its leaves are typically covered in a fine, whitish down. It is a deciduous species, shedding its leaves in the autumn, and thrives in well-drained soils. The subspecies is noted for its strong, sometimes unpleasant odor, which is more pronounced in the flowers."
