    "intro": "Rosa glauca subsp. mutata, commonly known as the blue rose or blueberry rose, is a rare and striking subshrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and its distinctive blue-gray foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that range in color from pale pink to deep blue, depending on environmental conditions. It is adapted to high-altitude environments and requires well-drained soil and full sun to thrive. Due to its rarity and unique appearance, it is often cultivated in specialized gardens and botanical collections."
