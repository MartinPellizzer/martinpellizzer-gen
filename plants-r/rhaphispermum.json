    "intro": "Rhaphispermum, commonly known as the African orchid. It is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae, native to tropical regions of Africa. The plants are typically small to medium-sized, with lance-shaped leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that come in a variety of colors. Rhaphispermum species are epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants without being parasitic, often found in humid, shaded environments. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and are cultivated in greenhouses and tropical gardens."
