    "intro": "Rhus allophyloides, commonly known as the smooth sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It belongs to the Anacardiaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like the cashew and poison ivy. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically pinnately arranged with serrated margins. Its small, yellowish-green flowers are clustered in upright panicles, and it produces red, fuzzy berries that are a food source for birds and small mammals. Rhus allophyloides is often found in open woods, along stream banks, and in disturbed soils, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade."
