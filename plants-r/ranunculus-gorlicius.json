    "intro": "Ranunculus gorlicius, commonly known as the Gorlician buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Central and Eastern Europe. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family, characterized by its showy, often brightly colored flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, riverbanks, and wetlands. Its flowers have five to eight sepals that resemble petals, and it produces small, green berries that contain seeds. Due to habitat loss, it is considered threatened in many regions and is protected in several European countries."
