It is characterized by its slender, arching stems and small, dark green leaves that often appear in dense clusters. The flowers are typically pale pink or white, and the fruit is a small, tart berry that ripens in late summer. This plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and ecologically valuable species within its native range."
