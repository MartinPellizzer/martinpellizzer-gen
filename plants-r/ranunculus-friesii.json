    "intro": "Ranunculus friesii, commonly known as the Fries' buttercup, is a species of flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often with a contrasting central mark. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and grasslands. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three deeply lobed leaflets, and it produces small, hairy fruits that disperse its seeds. Ranunculus friesii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant blooms."
