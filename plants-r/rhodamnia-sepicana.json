    "intro": "Rhodamnia sepicana, commonly known as the coastal rhodamnia, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southeastern Australia. It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. The plant produces small, fragrant white or pink flowers that bloom in spring. Its leaves are narrow and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss in coastal conditions. Rhodamnia sepicana is adapted to salt spray and can tolerate moderate levels of coastal wind and humidity."
