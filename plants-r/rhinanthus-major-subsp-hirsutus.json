    "intro": "Rhinanthus major subsp. hirsutus, commonly known as the hairy yellow rattle, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers that bloom from June to August. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from the roots of other plants while performing photosynthesis. It typically grows in grasslands, meadows, and disturbed soils, often forming dense colonies. Its hairy stems and leaves distinguish it from other members of the species."
