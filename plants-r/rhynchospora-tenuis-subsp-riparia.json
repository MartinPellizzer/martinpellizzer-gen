    "intro": "Rhynchospora tenuis subsp. riparia, commonly known as the slender spike-rush, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes grass-like plants known as sedges. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, pond edges, and along streams. Its flowering stems are usually unbranched and bear small, greenish-brown spikelets. The species is characterized by its narrow leaves and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
