    "intro": "Rubus fritschii, commonly known as the Fritsch's blackberry, is a species of brambles native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its thorny stems and aggregate fruits that ripen to a deep black color. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by the development of its edible berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas at higher elevations. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
