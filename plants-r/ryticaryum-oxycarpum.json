It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is characterized by its succulent, prostrate growth habit. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically pollinated by wind. Its fleshy, spiny fruits contain seeds that are dispersed by animals and wind. Ryticaryum oxycarpum is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability."
