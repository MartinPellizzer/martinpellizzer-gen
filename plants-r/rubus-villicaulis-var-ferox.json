    "intro": "Rubus villicaulis var. ferox, commonly known as the hairy blackberry. This variant is characterized by its dense, bristly hairs covering the stems and leaves, giving it a distinctive appearance. It produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically tart and less palatable compared to other blackberry varieties. The plant is native to certain regions of North America and thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is often found in woodlands and along stream banks, where it contributes to the local ecosystem by providing food for wildlife."
