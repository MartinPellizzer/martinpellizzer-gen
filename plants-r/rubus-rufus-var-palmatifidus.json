    "intro": "Rubus rufus var. palmatifidus, commonly known as the broad-leafed raspberry, is a variant of the raspberry plant native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its palmately divided leaves, which give it a distinctive, fern-like appearance. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or yellow in color, though they are less commonly consumed by humans compared to other raspberry varieties. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and thickets. This plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and its role in supporting local wildlife."
