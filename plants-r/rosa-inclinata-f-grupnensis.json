    "intro": "Rosa inclinata f. grupnensis, commonly known as the Groupnensian climbing rose, is a rare and ornamental plant native to specific regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its vigorous climbing habit and large, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant features dark green, serrated leaves and thorny stems, typical of many rose species. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a valuable but endangered botanical specimen."
