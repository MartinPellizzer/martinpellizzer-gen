    "intro": "Rapanea playfairii, commonly known as the white-leafed holly, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, lance-shaped leaves that are typically a deep green on the upper surface and lighter green underneath. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
