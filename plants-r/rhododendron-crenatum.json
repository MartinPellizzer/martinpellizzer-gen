    "intro": "Rhododendron crenatum, commonly known as the Japanese azalea, is a deciduous shrub native to East Asia. It features showy, funnel-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep pink, often with a red or purple throat. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters and has lance-shaped, dark green leaves with a slightly wavy margin. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. The flowers bloom in early spring, adding vibrant color to the landscape before the leaves fully emerge."
