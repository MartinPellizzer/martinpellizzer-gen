It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically pinnately arranged with 11 to 31 leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by red, fuzzy fruits that are a key feature of its botanical description. Rhus sinica thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
