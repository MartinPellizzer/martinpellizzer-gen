It features a cluster of short, cylindrical stems that are typically ribbed and covered in white to pale green spines. The plant produces vibrant, showy flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red during the spring and summer months. Its compact size and colorful blooms make it a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, requiring minimal water to prevent root rot."
