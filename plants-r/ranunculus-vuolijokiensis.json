    "intro": "Ranunculus vuolijokiensis, commonly known as the Vuolijoki buttercup, is a rare flowering plant native to the northern regions of Europe. It is characterized by its delicate, yellowish-orange flowers with five petals and a distinctive central stigma. The plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-rich soils along riverbanks and wet meadows. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a hairy surface that helps retain moisture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
