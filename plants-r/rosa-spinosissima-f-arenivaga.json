    "intro": "Rosa spinosissima f. arenivaga, commonly known as the sand rose, is a unique form of the prickly rose. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense covering of thorns, which provide protection against herbivores. The plant produces small, pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is adapted to arid environments, with reduced leaf size and thick, waxy cuticles to minimize water loss. This subspecies is often found in sandy soils and coastal areas, where it thrives in harsh, dry conditions."
