    "intro": "Ranunculus aequidens, commonly known as the water crowfoot, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to freshwater environments in Europe and Asia. It features delicate, palmately divided leaves that are typically submerged or floating on the water's surface. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of white, yellow, and orange, which bloom from spring to early summer. Ranunculus aequidens thrives in shallow, still or slow-moving waters and is often found in ponds, lakes, and wet meadows. Its presence indicates good water quality and is an important component of aquatic ecosystems."
