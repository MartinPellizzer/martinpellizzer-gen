    "intro": "Robiquetia merrillii, commonly known as the Merrill's starling orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the Philippines. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, star-shaped flowers that are typically pale yellow to greenish-white in color. The plant produces a single, erect stem that bears several clustered flowers, each with a distinct, intricate pattern of sepals and petals. Robiquetia merrillii thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in montane forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species."
