    "intro": "Rhododendron velutinum, commonly known as the silky rhododendron, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple, typically blooming in late spring. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Rhododendron velutinum is often found in temperate forests and is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological importance."
