    "intro": "Rhododendron dilatatum f. leucanthum, commonly known as the white-flowered alpine rhododendron, is a compact shrub native to the mountainous regions of western China. It is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves and clusters of white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained acidic soil. It is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats at high elevations. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it requires specific growing conditions to flourish."
