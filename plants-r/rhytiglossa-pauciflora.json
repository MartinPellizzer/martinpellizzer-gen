It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, epiphytic growth habit. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of white and pink, typically arranged in clusters. Its leaves are usually elongated and covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
