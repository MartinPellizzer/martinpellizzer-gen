    "intro": "Roupala percoriacea, commonly known as the silver wattle, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its slender, often silver-gray branches and pinnate leaves with small, ovate leaflets. The plant produces yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in spring, followed by narrow, woody pods containing seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and lowland areas. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
