    "intro": "Rudgea martiana, commonly known as the velvetleaf or Brazilian velvetleaf, is a tropical shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are often covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruits are capsules that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Rudgea martiana is often found in moist, shaded areas of tropical forests and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
