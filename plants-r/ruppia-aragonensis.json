    "intro": "Ruppia aragonensis, commonly known as the Aragon water plant, is a halophytic species native to the Mediterranean region. It thrives in brackish and saline waters, often found in coastal lagoons and estuaries. The plant has narrow, ribbon-like leaves that are typically submerged, and it produces small, yellowish flowers. It plays a crucial role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems by preventing erosion. Its ability to tolerate high salinity makes it an important indicator species for wetland health."
