    "intro": "Rubus porphyromallos, commonly known as the purple-fruited blackberry, is a species of shrub belonging to the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves, which are typically arranged alternately along the branches. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that develop from multiple ovaria, resulting in a dense, dark purple or black appearance. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges or disturbed soils. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and agricultural settings."
