    "intro": "Rhodax montanus var. mollis, commonly known as the soft mountain rhodax, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It features elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are soft to the touch, a characteristic that gives it its varietal name \"mollis.\" The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine soils. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
