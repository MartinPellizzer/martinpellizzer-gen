    "intro": "Robinia javanica, commonly known as the Javan acacia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and have a feathery appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in racemes, which bloom in the spring and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are enclosed in pod-like fruits that split open to release the seeds. Robinia javanica is often used in traditional medicine and has ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and flowers."
