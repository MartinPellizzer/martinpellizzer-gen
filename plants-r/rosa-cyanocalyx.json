    "intro": "Rosa cyanocalyx, commonly known as the Chinese rose or blue-flowered rose, is a deciduous shrub native to China. It is characterized by its compound leaves and clusters of fragrant, blue-violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, red-orange hips that contain seeds, which are dispersed by birds. Rosa cyanocalyx thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens. Its historical use in traditional Chinese medicine adds to its botanical significance."
