    "intro": "Rubus fruticosus var. umbrosus, commonly known as the blackberry bramble, is a thorny shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its dense, sprawling growth habit. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black in color. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The species is often used in hedgerows and for its edible fruits, though its aggressive growth can make it invasive in certain regions."
