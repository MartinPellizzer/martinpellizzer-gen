    "intro": "Rubus procerus microgene occiduus, commonly known as the slender bramble, is a rare shrub native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its small, thornless stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by red, hairy berries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
