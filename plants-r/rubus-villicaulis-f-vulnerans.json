    "intro": "Rubus villicaulis f. vulnerans, commonly known as the wounded blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its hairy stems and dark, often thorned foliage, which contribute to its rugged appearance. The plant produces small, dark purple berries that are typically less palatable than those of other blackberry species. Its botanical features include a complex inflorescence and a shrub-like growth habit. This form is notable for its resilience and ability to thrive in disturbed habitats."
