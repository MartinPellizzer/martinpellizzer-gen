    "intro": "Ranunculus asymmetrus, commonly known as the asymmetric buttercup, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its delicate, yellow or orange flowers with five to seven petals, often arranged asymmetrically, giving it its scientific name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or stream banks. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three deeply lobed leaflets, and it produces small, greenish-yellow seed pods that split open to release its seeds. Ranunculus asymmetrus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique floral structure."
