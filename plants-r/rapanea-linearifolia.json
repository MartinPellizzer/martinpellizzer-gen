    "intro": "Rapanea linearifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved holly, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, lance-shaped leaves that are typically glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by bright red berries that are edible for humans but toxic to livestock. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
