It is characterized by its slender stems and small, clustered flowers that range from white to pale pink. The plant produces small, edible berries that are typically red or black in color. It thrives in rocky or well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
