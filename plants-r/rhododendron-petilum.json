    "intro": "Rhododendron petilum, commonly known as the dwarf rhododendron, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of pink to red. The plant typically thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Its leaves are dark green, leathery, and arranged in whorls around the stems. Rhododendron petilum is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in cooler climates."
