    "intro": "Rosa rubiginosa subvar. densa, commonly known as the dense rose or bristly rose, is a shrub-like species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces rose hips, which are the fruit containing the seeds, and these hips are often used in herbal teas. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it adaptable to various garden environments. The dense growth habit of this subvariety provides habitat for small wildlife and contributes to its ecological significance."
