It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and produces small, dark purple to black berries. The plant has compound leaves with serrated edges and thorny stems typical of the Rubus genus. It thrives in coastal and mountainous regions, often growing in sandy or rocky soils. The berries are edible but are generally less palatable compared to other blackberry species."
