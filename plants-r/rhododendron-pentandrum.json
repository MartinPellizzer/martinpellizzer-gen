    "intro": "Rhododendron pentandrum, commonly known as the five-stamen rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in acidic, well-drained soils and thrives in shaded to partially shaded environments. Its botanical features include five stamens in each flower, a trait that gives it its scientific name. Rhododendron pentandrum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and woodland settings."
