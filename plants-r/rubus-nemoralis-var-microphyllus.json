    "intro": "Rubus nemoralis var. microphyllus, commonly known as the small-leaved blackberry, is a shrub native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, arching stems and small, dark green leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces aggregate fruits, known as berries, which are typically dark purple to black when mature. These berries are edible, though often tart, and are used in jams and wines. It thrives in woodland edges and open habitats, preferring well-drained soils."
