    "intro": "Rosa falciculata, commonly known as the swordleaf rose, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of fragrant, semi-double pink flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters and thrives in well-drained soil with full sun exposure. Its stems are covered in thorny prickles, which provide natural protection against herbivores. Rosa falciculata is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens for its visual appeal and scent."
