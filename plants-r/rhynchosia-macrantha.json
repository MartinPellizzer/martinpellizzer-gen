    "intro": "Rhynchosia macrantha, commonly known as the giant spider-plant, is a climbing legume native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its large, showy yellow flowers with prominent, elongated petals. The plant has compound leaves with numerous small leaflets and produces long, slender pods containing several seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and clearings. Its rapid growth and ability to climb make it both a useful ornamental plant and a potential weed in agricultural areas."
