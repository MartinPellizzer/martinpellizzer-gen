    "intro": "Rhinanthus aristatus subvar. velebiticus, commonly known as the Velebit yellowtop, is a rare flowering plant native to the Balkan Peninsula. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is hemiparasitic, relying on the roots of other plants for some of its nutrients. It thrives in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
