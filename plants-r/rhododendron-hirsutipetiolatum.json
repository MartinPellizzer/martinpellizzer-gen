    "intro": "Rhododendron hirsutipetiolatum, commonly known as the hairy-stemmed rhododendron, is a species native to China. It is characterized by its dense, hairy stems and broad, leathery leaves that are often dark green in color. The plant produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to purple, typically blooming in late spring. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is complemented by its ecological role in supporting local pollinators."
