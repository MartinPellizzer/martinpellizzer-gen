    "intro": "Ranunculus penicillatus var. calcareus, commonly known as the limestone buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to calcareous soils in Europe. It features delicate, yellow flowers with five petals and a hairy stem that often grows in clusters. The plant typically reaches a height of 10 to 30 centimeters and blooms from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are palmately divided and covered in fine hairs, while the roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils. This variety is often found in rocky or limestone-rich habitats, making it a characteristic species of alpine and subalpine environments."
