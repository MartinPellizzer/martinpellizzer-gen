    "intro": "Rubus connixus, commonly known as the coastal bramble, is a shrub native to coastal regions of western North America. It is characterized by its prickly stems and trifoliate leaves, which are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, hairy berries in the summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes and scrub habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it plays an important role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems."
