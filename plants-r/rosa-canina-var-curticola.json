    "intro": "Rosa canina var. curticola, commonly known as the bristly dog rose, is a variant of the common dog rose. It is a deciduous shrub native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. The plant is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. Its leaves are serrated and covered with fine hairs, giving them a distinctive texture. The fruit, or hip, is similar to that of the common dog rose but may vary slightly in size and color."
