    "intro": "Rorippa eustylis, commonly known as the water pennycress, is a small annual herbaceous plant that thrives in moist or aquatic environments. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and streams. The plant has alternate, entire leaves that are usually submerged or floating, and it produces small, yellow flowers in clusters. Its seeds are enclosed in a siliqua, a type of dry fruit, which allows for wind dispersal. Rorippa eustylis is often found in temperate regions and is part of the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants."
