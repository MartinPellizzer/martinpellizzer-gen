    "intro": "Rhamnus frangula var. heterophylla, commonly known as the variable buckthorn, is a shrub native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its alternate, simple, and often elliptical leaves that vary in size and shape, giving it its varietal name. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by dark blue-black berries that are a food source for birds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or hedgerows. Due to its variability in morphology, it can be challenging to distinguish from other Rhamnus species in the field."
