    "intro": "Rosa glauca var. trachyphylloides, commonly known as the roughleaf dogwood rose, is a shrub-like plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The leaves are distinctive for their rough, hairy texture and dark green color, which provide a striking contrast to the pale flowers. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and hardy nature, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. It is also valued for its role in supporting local pollinators and wildlife."
