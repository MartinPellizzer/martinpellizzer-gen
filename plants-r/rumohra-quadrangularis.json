    "intro": "Rumohra quadrangularis, commonly known as the bamboo grass or bamboo reed, is a perennial grass native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems that are often mistaken for bamboo due to their similar appearance. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Rumohra quadrangularis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticulture for its aesthetic and ecological benefits."
