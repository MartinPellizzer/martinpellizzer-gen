    "intro": "Rubus chaerophyllus microgene horridisepalus, commonly known as the rough-sepaled blackberry, is a species of brambles native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its dense, thorny growth habit and dark purple to black berries that ripen in the fall. The plant has elliptical leaves with serrated edges and produces small, white flowers in the spring. Its fruits are edible but have a tart flavor and are often used in jams and preserves. The species is notable for its rugged appearance and adaptability to harsh, high-altitude environments."
