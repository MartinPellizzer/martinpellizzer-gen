    "intro": "Rosa banksiae f. lutea, commonly known as the yellow banksia rose, is a hybrid rose species originating from the hybridization of Rosa banksiae and Rosa chinensis. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow flowers, which are typically produced in clusters and bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is a shrub with thorny stems and dark green, leathery foliage that provides a striking contrast to its bright floral displays. It is relatively drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for garden cultivation. Due to its ornamental value, it is often used in landscaping and as a cut flower."
