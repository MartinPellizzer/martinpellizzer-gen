    "intro": "Rubus ulmifolius subf. microphyllus, commonly known as the small-leaved blackberry, is a shrub native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, thorny growth habit and small, oval-shaped leaves with a finely toothed margin. The plant produces aggregate fruits, typically dark purple to black in color, which are edible and often used in jams and desserts. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, acidic conditions. This subspecies is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its culinary uses."
