It is characterized by its dense, thorny growth habit and compound leaves with a striking, velvety texture. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits known as berries, which are typically red or black in color and edible. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or alpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and natural reserves."
