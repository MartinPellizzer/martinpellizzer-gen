    "intro": "Rorippa \u00d7 petiolata, commonly known as the hybrid watercress, is a flowering plant in the Brassicaceae family. It is a naturally occurring hybrid between Rorippa indica and Rorippa islandica, characterized by its aquatic or semi-aquatic habitat. The plant typically features small, edible, heart-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating on the water's surface. It produces small white or yellow flowers and is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits a range of morphological variations depending on its geographic location and environmental conditions."
