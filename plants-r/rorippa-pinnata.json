It is characterized by its small, alternate leaves that are typically narrow and slightly serrated. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that grow in clusters, often on slender stems that emerge from water or moist soil. Rorippa pinnata is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes other cruciferous plants. It is often found in wetlands, ditches, and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in aquatic or semi-aquatic environments."
