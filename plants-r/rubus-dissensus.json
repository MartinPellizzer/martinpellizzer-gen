It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and produces small, dark red to black berries. The plant has trifoliate leaves with serrated edges and produces white to pink flowers in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value and edible fruits."
