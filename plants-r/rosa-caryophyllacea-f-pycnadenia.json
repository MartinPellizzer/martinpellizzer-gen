    "intro": "Rosa caryophyllacea f. pycnadenia, commonly known as the dense-leaved rose, is a flowering plant species characterized by its compact growth habit and densely packed foliage. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is native to regions of southern Europe and western Asia. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow, serrated, and arranged alternately along the stems, contributing to its ornamental appeal. This form is notable for its thick, leathery leaves, which provide a unique texture and help it thrive in drier conditions."
