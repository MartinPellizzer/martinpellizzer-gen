    "intro": "Rhaphidophora fallax, commonly known as the velvetleaf calathea, is a tropical flowering plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, variegated foliage with deep green veins and a soft, velvety texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or pale green flowers that are typically borne on spikes above the leaves. Rhaphidophora fallax thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistently moist, well-draining soil. It is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its ornamental leaves and relatively low maintenance requirements."
