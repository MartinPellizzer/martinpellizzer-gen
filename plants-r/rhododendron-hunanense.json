    "intro": "Rhododendron hunanense, commonly known as the Hunan rhododendron, is a species native to China, particularly found in the mountainous regions of Hunan province. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring dense, leathery leaves that are elliptical in shape. The plant produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to red, which bloom in spring. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is complemented by its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
