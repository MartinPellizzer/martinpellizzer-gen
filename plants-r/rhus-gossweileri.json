    "intro": "Rhus gossweileri, commonly known as the Florida holly, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its spiny stems and alternate, elliptical leaves that are dark green above and lighter below. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are followed by bright red, spherical berries that persist through winter. Rhus gossweileri is often found in wetlands, swamps, and along stream banks, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems and a valuable ornamental plant."
