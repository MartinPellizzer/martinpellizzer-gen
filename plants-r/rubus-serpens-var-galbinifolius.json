It is characterized by its slender, trailing growth habit and small, dark berries that ripen in late summer. The leaves are typically narrow and have a slightly serrated edge, distinguishing it from other Rubus species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional herbal medicine."
