    "intro": "Ribes orientale var. resinosum, commonly known as the resinous gooseberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its small, yellowish-green berries that are covered in a sticky resin, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have serrated edges, while its stems are often woody and covered in fine hairs. This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance and historical significance."
