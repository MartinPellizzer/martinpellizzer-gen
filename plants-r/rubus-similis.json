    "intro": "Rubus similis, commonly known as the similar bramble, is a deciduous shrub belonging to the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers. The plant produces edible berries that are typically red or black in color, though they are often tart and less commonly consumed than other Rubus species. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils. The leaves are compound, with three to five leaflets, and the plant is known for its vigorous growth and ability to spread through rhizomes."
