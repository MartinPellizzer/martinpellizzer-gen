    "intro": "Rhipsalis lindbergiana, commonly known as the Christmas cactus, is a species of cactus native to the tropical rainforests of Brazil. It is characterized by its trailing stems and clusters of colorful, tubular flowers that bloom in winter. Unlike typical cacti, it does not have spines, instead featuring smooth, segmented stems that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is a popular houseplant due to its ornamental value and ability to bloom during the holiday season."
