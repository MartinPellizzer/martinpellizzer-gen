    "intro": "Rosa canina f. senticosa, commonly known as the sweet briar rose, is a fragrant shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems, dark green leaves, and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant produces red, hairy berries that are rich in vitamin C and are often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. The sweet scent of its flowers makes it a popular choice for hedging and ornamental gardening."
