    "intro": "Rosa canina subvar. vacciniifolia, commonly known as the blackthorn rose, is a shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dark, thorny stems and small, oval leaves that are usually glossy green. The plant produces white or pale pink flowers in early spring, followed by dark blue or black berries in the fall. These berries are rich in vitamin C and have been used historically in herbal medicine. The species is well adapted to harsh environments, often growing in woodland edges and rocky soils."
