    "intro": "Rubus porotoensis, commonly known as the Porotoensis blackberry, is a species of brambles native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black in color. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and partial shade. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and less-studied member of the Rubus genus."
