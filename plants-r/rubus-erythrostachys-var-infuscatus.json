    "intro": "Rubus erythrostachys var. infuscatus, commonly known as the blackberry bramble, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its dense, thorny growth habit and dark green, trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, aggregated fruits that ripen to a deep red or black color, typically in late summer. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and for foraging purposes."
