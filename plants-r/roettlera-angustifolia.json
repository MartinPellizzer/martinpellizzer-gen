    "intro": "Roettlera angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved roettlera, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, upright stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale blue or violet flowers arranged in loose clusters, which bloom in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Roettlera angustifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
