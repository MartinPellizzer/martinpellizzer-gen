    "intro": "Ranunculus cornutus, commonly known as the horned buttercup, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers with five petals and a central cluster of stamens that resemble horns, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a rough, hairy texture, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that disperse its seeds. Ranunculus cornutus is a perennial species that blooms from late spring to early summer."
