    "intro": "Rhododendron longistylum subsp. decumbens, commonly known as the long-stemmed rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in forest understories where it thrives in acidic, well-drained soils. Its leaves are elliptical and dark green, providing a striking contrast to its vibrant floral displays. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with suitable growing conditions."
