    "intro": "Rubus grandiflorus, commonly known as the large-flowered blackberry, is a species of brambles native to the eastern United States. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows in moist, wooded areas and thrives in partial to full shade. The plant produces large, showy white to pink flowers in the spring, which are followed by dark purple berries in the summer. Its leaves are compound, with three to five leaflets, and the stems are covered in thorny, serrated projections. The berries are edible, though often tart, and are used in jams and pies, while the plant also serves as a habitat for various insects and birds."
