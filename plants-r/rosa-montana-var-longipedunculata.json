    "intro": "Rosa montana var. longipedunculata, commonly known as the Alpine rose, is a deciduous shrub characterized by its upright growth habit and dense, thorny stems. It features compound leaves with ovate to lanceolate leaflets, typically arranged in odd pairs. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of pink to red, often in clusters at the ends of long peduncles, giving it its varietal name. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is adapted to cool, mountainous climates. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in alpine and rock garden settings."
