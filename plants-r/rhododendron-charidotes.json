    "intro": "Rhododendron charidotes, commonly known as the Sierra Madre rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows in high-altitude forests with cool, moist conditions. The plant features broad, ovate leaves that are often hairy on the underside, and it produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to purple. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in the wild."
