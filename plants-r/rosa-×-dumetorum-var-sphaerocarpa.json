    "intro": "Rosa \u00d7 dumetorum var. sphaerocarpa, commonly known as the globe thimbleberry, is a hybrid shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its dense, thorny growth habit and small, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of white to pale pink flowers in early summer, which are followed by red, spherical berries that are edible but have a tart flavor. Its berries are often used in jams and wines due to their high acidity. The species is well adapted to moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
