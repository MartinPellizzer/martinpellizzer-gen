    "intro": "Ruminia nicaeensis, commonly known as the Sicilian sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, often found near water bodies such as ponds and streams. The plant has linear, grass-like leaves that are often submerged or floating, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in its native environment. Ruminia nicaeensis plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
