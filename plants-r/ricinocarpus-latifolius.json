    "intro": "Ricinocarpus latifolius, commonly known as the broadleaf ricin tree, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by woody, spiny fruits. The plant is known for containing toxic compounds, including ricin, which makes it dangerous to handle. It is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, growing in coastal and lowland areas. Due to its toxic properties, it is not commonly cultivated for ornamental or agricultural purposes."
