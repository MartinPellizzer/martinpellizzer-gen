    "intro": "Rheum palmatum, commonly known as Chinese rhubarb, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in diameter. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in dense clusters during the summer months. Its roots and rhizomes are the primary parts used in traditional medicine and as a source of medicinal compounds. Rheum palmatum is also cultivated for its ornamental value due to its striking foliage."
