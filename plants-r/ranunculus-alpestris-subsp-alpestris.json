    "intro": "Ranunculus alpestris subsp. alpestris, commonly known as the alpine buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to alpine regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in rocky, open habitats at high altitudes, where it thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils. The plant features simple, trifoliate leaves and produces showy, yellow flowers with five to nine petals. It is characterized by its ability to withstand cold temperatures and is often found in meadows and scree slopes. Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to its harsh, mountainous environment."
