    "intro": "Rhamnus polygama, commonly known as the silverleaf buckthorn, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dark green, shiny leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by reddish-brown berries that are toxic to humans and livestock. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in chaparral and woodland habitats. Rhamnus polygama plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for certain wildlife species."
