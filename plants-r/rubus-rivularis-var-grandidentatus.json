    "intro": "Rubus rivularis var. grandidentatus, commonly known as the large-toothed blackberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves with large, serrated lobes and produces aggregate fruits composed of tiny drupelets. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland edges and stream banks. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, and it is often found in association with other shade-tolerant species. The variety is distinguished by its larger, more pronounced leaf teeth compared to other Rubus species."
