    "intro": "Rosmarinus \u00d7 lavandulaceus var. trogloditarum, commonly known as the Troglodytes lavender, is a rare hybrid plant that combines traits of rosemary and lavender. It is characterized by its aromatic, needle-like leaves and clusters of small, fragrant purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun, making it suitable for Mediterranean climates. Its essential oils contain compounds like camphor and pinene, which contribute to its distinctive scent and medicinal properties. Due to its limited natural range, it is often cultivated in specialized gardens or botanical collections."
