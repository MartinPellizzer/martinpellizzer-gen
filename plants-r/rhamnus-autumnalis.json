    "intro": "Rhamnus autumnalis, commonly known as autumnal buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 feet and features small, oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by black, egg-shaped berries. These berries are a food source for birds and other wildlife. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, with a distinctive, aromatic scent when crushed."
