    "intro": "Rhus samo, commonly known as the Samoan sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the islands of Samoa and nearby regions in the Pacific. It belongs to the Anacardiaceae family, which includes other plants like poison ivy and mango. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically pinnate with 5 to 9 leaflets, and its small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in clusters. Rhus samo produces red, fleshy berries that are edible for some animals but can be toxic to humans if consumed in large quantities. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
