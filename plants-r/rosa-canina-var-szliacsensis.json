    "intro": "Rosa canina var. szliacsensis, commonly known as the Szliacsz\u00e9n rose, is a rare and lesser-known variant of the dog rose. It is native to specific regions in Central Europe, particularly Hungary and parts of Austria. This plant typically features thorny stems and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink to white. Its leaves are pinnate, with serrated edges, and the fruits are red, hairy hips that contain seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a botanically significant but endangered species."
