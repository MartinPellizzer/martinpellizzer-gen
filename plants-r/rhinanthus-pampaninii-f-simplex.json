    "intro": "Rhinanthus pampaninii f. simplex, commonly known as the simple yellow rattle, is a flowering plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients while performing photosynthesis. This plant typically grows in grasslands and open habitats, often found in the Mediterranean region. Its flowers are yellow and bilaterally symmetrical, with a distinctive lower lip that aids in pollination. The species is noted for its ecological importance in supporting pollinators and maintaining biodiversity in its native environment."
