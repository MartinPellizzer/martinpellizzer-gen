    "intro": "Rhynchospora aristata var. suberecta, commonly known as the erect spike-rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh habitats in North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and other grass-like plants. The plant features slender, upright stems that bear small, clustered spikes of pale green to brownish flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. This variety is distinguished by its more erect growth habit compared to other forms of Rhynchospora aristata."
