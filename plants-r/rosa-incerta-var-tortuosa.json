    "intro": "Rosa incerta var. tortuosa, commonly known as the twisted-stem rose, is a less commonly cultivated variety of the rose family. It is characterized by its twisted, spiraling stems and small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or white. The plant is native to parts of Asia, particularly China, and thrives in temperate climates. It has a compact growth habit and is often grown as a decorative shrub in gardens. Due to its rarity and specific care requirements, it is not widely available in commercial horticulture."
