    "intro": "Rumex acetosella var. ovalifolius, commonly known as sourgrass, is a variant of the common sorrel. It is a low-growing perennial plant characterized by its oval-shaped leaves and reddish stems. The leaves are typically hairless and have a sour taste due to the presence of oxalic acid. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. This variant is less common than the typical form of Rumex acetosella and is sometimes considered a subspecies or variant based on leaf morphology."
