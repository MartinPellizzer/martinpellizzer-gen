    "intro": "Rubus allegheniensis f. albinus, commonly known as the white-fruited blackberry, is a botanical variant of the Allegheny blackberry. It is characterized by its pale yellow to white fruits, which contrast with the typical dark purple berries of the species. The plant is a shrub with thorny stems and trifoliate leaves, typical of the Rubus genus. It produces small, white flowers in the spring, which give way to its distinctive fruiting bodies. This form is less common in the wild and is often cultivated for its unique appearance and flavor."
