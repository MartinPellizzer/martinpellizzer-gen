    "intro": "Rhododendron nivale subsp. boreale, commonly known as the alpine rhododendron, is a shrub native to the high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of bell-shaped, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, often found in alpine tundra and rocky slopes. Its leaves are typically leathery and dark green, providing a striking contrast to the delicate flowers. This subspecies is well adapted to harsh climates, with a compact growth form that helps it withstand strong winds and low temperatures."
