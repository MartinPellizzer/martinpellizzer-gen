    "intro": "Rosa \u00d7 waitziana f. glabriuscula, commonly known as the smooth-stemmed hybrid rose, is a botanical variety characterized by its compact growth habit and profuse flowering. It is a hybrid between Rosa rugosa and Rosa \u00d7 centifolia, resulting in a plant that combines the hardiness of its parent species with the ornamental value of its blooms. The leaves are typically medium green, with a slightly serrated margin, and the stems are covered in a fine, almost hairless layer. This variety is prized for its fragrant, semi-double pink flowers that appear in late spring to early summer. It is well-suited for garden cultivation and thrives in full sun with well-drained soil."
