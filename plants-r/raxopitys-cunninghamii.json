    "intro": "Raxopitys cunninghamii, commonly known as the Cunningham's raxopitys, is a rare and unique plant species native to the rainforests of northeastern Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its striking, spirally arranged leaves that form a dense, umbrella-like canopy. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that bloom in spring, followed by distinctive, elongated seed pods. Its leaves are thick and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in the humid, shaded environments it inhabits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Raxopitys cunninghamii is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss."
