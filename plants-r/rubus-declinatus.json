    "intro": "Rubus declinatus, commonly known as the bent bramble, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and thorny stems, which help it to climb or spread across the ground. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by red, edible berries. It is typically found in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are compound, with three to five leaflets, and the plant is often used in ecological restoration due to its ability to stabilize soil."
