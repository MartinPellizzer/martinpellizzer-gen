    "intro": "Rhomboda alticola var. alticola, commonly known as the mountain rhomboda, is a perennial herb native to high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its rhomboid-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forest understories or on rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
