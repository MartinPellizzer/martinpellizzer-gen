    "intro": "Rubus volvatus var. concolor, commonly known as the smooth blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant characterized by its smooth, glabrous stems and foliage. It is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States, typically found in moist woodlands and along streambanks. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are usually smaller than those of other blackberry varieties. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three oval-shaped leaflets, and the plant has a thorny structure typical of the Rubus genus. The smooth blackberry is valued for its edible fruits and its role in supporting local wildlife."
