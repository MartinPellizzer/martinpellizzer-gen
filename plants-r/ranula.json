    "intro": "Ranula, commonly known as the bladder orchid, is a type of orchid characterized by its unique, inflated, bladder-like structure in its flower. It belongs to the genus *Pterocoryne* and is native to Australia, particularly in the southern regions. The plant typically grows as a perennial herb with a rosette of leaves and produces a single, showy flower with a distinctive, bulbous lower lip. Ranulas are known for their ability to thrive in dry, sandy soils and are often found in coastal areas. Their botanical features make them an interesting subject for both horticultural and ecological study."
