    "intro": "Rapanea salicina, commonly known as the silky ash, is a small evergreen tree or shrub native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by small, round berries that turn red when mature. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has some traditional uses in local medicine."
