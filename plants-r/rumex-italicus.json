    "intro": "Rumex italicus, commonly known as Italian sorrel, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to southern Europe. It features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive reddish coloration, often with a serrated edge. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the spring. It thrives in moist, fertile soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Its leaves are edible and have a tangy, sour flavor due to their high oxalic acid content."
