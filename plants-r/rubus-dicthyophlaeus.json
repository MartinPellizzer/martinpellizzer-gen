It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that ripen to a dark purple or black color. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils. Its botanical features make it a common but often overlooked member of the Rubus genus."
