    "intro": "Rhododendron dachengense var. scopulum, commonly known as the Dacheng rock rhododendron, is a rare and endemic species native to China. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is typically found in mountainous regions with high humidity. Its floral structure is typical of the Ericaceae family, with five petals and stamens that are often brightly colored. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable species for botanical research and conservation efforts."
