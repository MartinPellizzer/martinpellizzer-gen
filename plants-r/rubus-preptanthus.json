    "intro": "Rubus preptanthus, commonly known as the alpine blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Europe. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, dark red to black berries that are typically eaten by birds and other wildlife. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
