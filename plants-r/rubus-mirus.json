    "intro": "Rubus mirus, commonly known as the fairy raspberry, is a species of bramble native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, arching stems and small, clustered flowers that range from white to pale pink. The plant produces small, tart berries that are often used in local traditional medicine. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the plant thrives in shaded, moist environments. Due to its limited distribution, Rubus mirus is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
