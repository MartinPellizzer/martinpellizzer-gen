    "intro": "Rhynchosia viscida, commonly known as the sticky senna, is a perennial legume native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its climbing habit and trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in racemes, followed by pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Rhynchosia viscida has been used traditionally for its medicinal properties, particularly in treating skin conditions and as a remedy for inflammation."
