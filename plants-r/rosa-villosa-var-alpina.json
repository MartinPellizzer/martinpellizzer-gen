    "intro": "Rosa villosa var. alpina, commonly known as the alpine evergreen rose, is a compact shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, fragrant white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is adapted to cold climates and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its hairy stems and leaves provide protection against harsh weather conditions. Rosa villosa var. alpina is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in temperate gardens."
