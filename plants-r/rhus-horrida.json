    "intro": "Rhus horrida, commonly known as the staghorn sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern and central United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are bright green in summer and turn vibrant red in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by red, fuzzy berries that are a food source for birds and small mammals. Rhus horrida thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established. Its rough, thorny stems and distinctive foliage make it easily identifiable in the wild."
