    "intro": "Rubroshorea myrionerva, commonly known as the redshorea fern, is a tropical plant characterized by its distinctive reddish-brown fronds. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in the Philippines and Indonesia. The plant has a rhizomatous structure, with long, creeping stems that support its delicate, feather-like leaves. Its unique coloration and structure make it a popular choice for ornamental horticulture. However, due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in the wild."
