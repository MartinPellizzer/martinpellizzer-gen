    "intro": "Rosa tomentella f. eminens, commonly known as the alpine rose, is a compact, shrub-like plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage, which gives it a distinctive appearance and helps it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its growth habit is low and spreading, often forming dense mats that help stabilize soil in rocky or alpine habitats. Rosa tomentella f. eminens is well adapted to cold climates and is often found at high elevations where few other plants can survive."
