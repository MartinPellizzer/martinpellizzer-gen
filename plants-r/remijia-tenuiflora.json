It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or mountainous habitats, preferring well-drained soils. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
