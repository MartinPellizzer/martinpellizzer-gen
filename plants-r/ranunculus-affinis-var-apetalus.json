This plant is native to parts of Europe and is often found in moist, calcareous soils. It produces small, yellowish flowers with sepals that resemble petals, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are typically palmately divided and have a hairy texture. It is a short-lived perennial that blooms in early spring and is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value."
