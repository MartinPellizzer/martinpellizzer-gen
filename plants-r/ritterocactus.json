    "intro": "Ritterocactus, commonly known as the \"Tulip Cactus,\" is a genus of cacti native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that often branch into clusters, resembling the shape of a tulip when in bloom. The plant produces vibrant, showy flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, which appear at the ends of the stems during the spring and summer months. Ritterocactus species are generally drought-tolerant and thrive in full sun, making them popular choices for rock gardens and arid landscapes. Their unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements make them a favored addition to both indoor and outdoor collections."
