    "intro": "Rumex elbrusensis, commonly known as the Elbrus sorrel, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Caucasus. It is characterized by its upright stems and lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually greenish-yellow in color, which bloom in the summer months. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky areas. Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
