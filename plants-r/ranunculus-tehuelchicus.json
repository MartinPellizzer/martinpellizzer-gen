    "intro": "Ranunculus tehuelchicus, commonly known as the Tehuelchian buttercup, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly found in the Andes region of Chile and Argentina. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, temperate climates, often in mountainous or alpine environments. The plant features showy, yellow or orange flowers with five to seven petals, surrounded by a ring of sepals that resemble additional petals. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a distinctive lobed structure that aids in photosynthesis in its native habitat. Ranunculus tehuelchicus is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators."
