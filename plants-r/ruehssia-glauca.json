    "intro": "Ruehssia glauca, commonly known as the blue ruehssia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its striking blue-green foliage and small, clustered white flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has a compact growth habit, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a container plant. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, and it is relatively drought-tolerant once established. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in horticulture for its unique appearance."
