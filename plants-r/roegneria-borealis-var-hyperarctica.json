    "intro": "Roegneria borealis var. hyperarctica, commonly known as the Arctic wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates with long winters. Its ecological importance includes stabilizing soil in harsh environments and serving as a food source for grazing animals."
