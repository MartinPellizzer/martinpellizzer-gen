    "intro": "Rhododendron pruniflorum, commonly known as the Chinese rhododendron, is a species native to eastern Asia, particularly China, Korea, and Japan. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters, featuring dense, leathery leaves that are elliptical in shape. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is complemented by its ecological role in supporting local pollinators."
