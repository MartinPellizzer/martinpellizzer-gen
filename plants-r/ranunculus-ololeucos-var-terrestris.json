    "intro": "Ranunculus ololeucos var. terrestris, commonly known as the creeping buttercup, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a spreading growth habit with rhizomatous stems that allow it to colonize moist, disturbed soils. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in early spring. Its leaves are deeply lobed and often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. It is often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along riverbanks, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
