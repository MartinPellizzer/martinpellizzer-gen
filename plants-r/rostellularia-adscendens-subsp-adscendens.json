It belongs to the family Araceae and is characterized by its climbing habit and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces striking spathes that enclose small, white flowers, which are followed by bright red berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in secondary forests. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
