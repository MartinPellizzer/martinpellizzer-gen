    "intro": "Rhinanthus songeonii, commonly known as the Korean yellow toadflax, is a flowering plant native to Korea. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and forest edges. Its unique floral structure and ecological role make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
