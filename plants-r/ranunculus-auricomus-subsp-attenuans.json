It features delicate, palmate leaves with a hairy underside and produces showy, yellow flowers with five to seven petals. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. It is characterized by its slender, attenuated leaves that taper to a fine point. The subspecies is distinguished from the typical form by its more elongated leaf shape and slightly smaller flowers."
