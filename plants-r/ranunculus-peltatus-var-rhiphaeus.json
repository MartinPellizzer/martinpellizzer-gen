    "intro": "Ranunculus peltatus var. rhiphaeus, commonly known as the purple buttercup, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features showy, bright yellow to orange flowers with five to eight petals, often adorned with a distinctive purple or reddish hue at the base. The plant has palmately lobed leaves that are deeply divided, giving it a delicate, fern-like appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Its botanical significance lies in its ornamental value and its role in traditional herbal medicine."
