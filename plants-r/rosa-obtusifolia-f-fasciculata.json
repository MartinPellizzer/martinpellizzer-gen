    "intro": "Rosa obtusifolia f. fasciculata, commonly known as the clustered shrub rose, is a compact, deciduous shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features small, dark green leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a slightly serrated margin. The plant produces fragrant, pale pink to white flowers in late spring to early summer. Its compact growth habit and dense foliage make it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. It is relatively low maintenance, preferring well-drained soil and full sun."
