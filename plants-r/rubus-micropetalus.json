    "intro": "Rubus micropetalus, commonly known as the small-petalled blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its thorny stems and aggregate fruits, which are typically dark purple to black in color. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by the development of its edible berries. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the plant thrives in moist, woodland habitats. Rubus micropetalus is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in local cuisines."
