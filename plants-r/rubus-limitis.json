    "intro": "Rubus limitis, commonly known as the alpine raspberry, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves, which are typically arranged alternately along the branches. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are usually red or black in color, similar to other members of the Rubus genus. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions at high altitudes."
