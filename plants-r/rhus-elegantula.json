    "intro": "Rhus elegantula, commonly known as the staghorn sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are composed of 15 to 31 pairs of oval, serrated leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in panicles, followed by red, fuzzy berries that are a food source for birds and wildlife. Its bark is thick and rugged, with a distinctive, horn-like appearance on older stems, giving it its common name. Rhus elegantula thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in woodlands."
