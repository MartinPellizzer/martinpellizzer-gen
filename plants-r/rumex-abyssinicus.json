    "intro": "Rumex abyssinicus, commonly known as Abyssinian sorrel, is a perennial herb native to the highlands of Ethiopia. It features a robust rhizomatous root system and produces rosettes of lance-shaped, reddish leaves with a sour taste due to its high oxalic acid content. The plant blooms with clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers that are pollinated by insects. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions with cool climates. Its leaves are used in local cuisines and traditional medicine, highlighting its ecological and cultural significance."
