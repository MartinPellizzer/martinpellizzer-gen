    "intro": "Rhododendron atlanticum f. luteoalbum, commonly known as the yellow-white Atlantic rhododendron, is a rare and striking variant of the Atlantic rhododendron. It is characterized by its unique combination of pale yellow and white flower colors, which set it apart from typical rhododendron species. The plant is native to the coastal regions of the northeastern United States, where it thrives in acidic, well-drained soils. Its foliage is typically dark green and glossy, providing a striking contrast to its showy blooms. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered plant in its native range."
