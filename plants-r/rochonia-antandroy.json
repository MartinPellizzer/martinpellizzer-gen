    "intro": "Rochonia antandroy, commonly known as the Antandroy rochonia, is a rare flowering plant native to Madagascar. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its unique, palmate leaves and showy, pentagonal flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or dry habitats, adapting to the arid conditions of its native environment. Its blooming period occurs during the wet season, and it plays a role in the local ecosystem by providing nectar for pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
