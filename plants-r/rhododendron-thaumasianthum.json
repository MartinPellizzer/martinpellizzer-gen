    "intro": "Rhododendron thaumasianthum, commonly known as the Himalayan rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Asia, particularly in Nepal and Bhutan. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows at elevations between 2,000 and 3,500 meters. The plant features broad, leathery leaves and produces clusters of bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to red during the spring. Its botanical characteristics include a woody stem, showy inflorescences, and a preference for acidic, well-drained soils. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by providing nectar for pollinators and shelter for small animals."
