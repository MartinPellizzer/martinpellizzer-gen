    "intro": "Ranunculus cassubicus var. subalpinus, commonly known as the alpine buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. The plant features showy yellow flowers with five petals, often surrounded by a ring of white or pale yellow sepals. Its leaves are deeply divided into narrow, lobed segments, and it produces small, greenish fruits that disperse via wind. This species is adapted to harsh mountain climates and is often found in alpine meadows and scree slopes."
