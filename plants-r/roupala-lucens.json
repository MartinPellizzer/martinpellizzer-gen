    "intro": "Roupala lucens, commonly known as the silverleaf tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that have a distinctive silvery underside, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by spherical, woody fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a landscape plant."
