    "intro": "Rhus lucens, commonly known as the shining sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically pinnately arranged with serrated edges. The plant produces small, clustered yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by red, fuzzy berries that persist into the winter. Rhus lucens thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in moist to wet soils along stream banks. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in riparian areas."
