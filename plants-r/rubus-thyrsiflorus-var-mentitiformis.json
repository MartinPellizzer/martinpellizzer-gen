    "intro": "Rubus thyrsiflorus var. mentitiformis, commonly known as the ghostly raspberry, is a rare and elusive variant of the raspberry plant. It is characterized by its delicate, almost ethereal appearance, with pale pink flowers and translucent, waxy leaves. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically found in temperate rainforests. Its fruits are small, tart, and have a unique, slightly metallic flavor. Due to its rarity and fragile nature, it is highly sought after by botanists and conservationists alike."
