    "intro": "Rondonanthus, commonly known as the \"Amazonian orchid,\" is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, showy flowers that typically feature vibrant colors such as yellow, orange, and red. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Rondonanthus species are epiphytic, meaning they grow on the surfaces of trees rather than in the soil. Due to habitat loss and overcollection, many species of Rondonanthus are now considered endangered."
