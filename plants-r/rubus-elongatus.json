    "intro": "Rubus elongatus, commonly known as the elongated blackberry, is a species of shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, dark red berries that ripen in late summer. The plant has trifoliate leaves with serrated edges and produces white flowers in the spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. The berries are edible but have a tart flavor, making them suitable for jams and pies."
