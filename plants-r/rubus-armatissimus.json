    "intro": "Rubus armatissimus, commonly known as the bristly blackberry, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is native to eastern North America and is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, dark berries. The plant typically grows in wooded areas and along stream banks, preferring moist, well-drained soils. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and its flowers are white or pale pink. The berries are edible when ripe but are generally considered less palatable compared to other blackberry varieties."
