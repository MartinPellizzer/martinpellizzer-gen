    "intro": "Rondeletia rupicola, commonly known as the rock rondeletia, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically red or orange, often with a yellow throat, and are arranged in clusters. It thrives in rocky or well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or mountainous regions. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is more commonly seen in its natural habitat."
