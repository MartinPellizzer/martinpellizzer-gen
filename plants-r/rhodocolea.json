    "intro": "Rhodocolea, commonly known as the African violet, is a genus of flowering plants native to southern Africa. These plants are characterized by their rosettes of velvety, waxy leaves and showy, often fragrant flowers that bloom in a variety of colors. Rhodocolea species typically have a compact growth habit and are well-suited for indoor cultivation due to their preference for bright, indirect light. They produce flowers on long, slender stems, and their foliage is often used in traditional medicine. The genus includes several species, such as Rhodocolea coccinea and Rhodocolea multiflora, which are prized for their ornamental value."
