    "intro": "Rubus luminosus, commonly known as the glowing raspberry, is a rare and striking plant native to the misty highlands of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its bioluminescent leaves and flowers, which emit a soft blue glow at night. The plant belongs to the Rosaceae family, sharing some traits with other raspberries but possessing unique photoluminescent properties. Its stems are covered in fine, silver-haired bristles, and its fruits are small, tart berries that mature in late summer. Due to its elusive nature and habitat requirements, it is considered a highly specialized and endangered species."
