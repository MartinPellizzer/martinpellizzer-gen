    "intro": "Ranunculus stenoschistus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with five petal-like sepals, which are often mistaken for true petals. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
