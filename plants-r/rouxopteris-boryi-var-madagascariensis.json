    "intro": "Rouxopteris boryi var. madagascariensis, commonly known as the Madagascar fern, is a rare and endemic species native to Madagascar. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, pinnate fronds with a distinctive, glossy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in humid forest understories. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly, forming compact clumps. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
