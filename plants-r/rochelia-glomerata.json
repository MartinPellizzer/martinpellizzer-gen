    "intro": "Rochelia glomerata, commonly known as the clustered rosette plant, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, particularly South Africa. The plant forms dense, compact rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are small and yellow, arranged in clusters, and bloom during the warmer months. Rochelia glomerata is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, making it a resilient and hardy species."
