    "intro": "Radiogrammitis neocaledonica, commonly known as the New Caledonian fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the island of New Caledonia. It is characterized by its delicate, intricate fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in high humidity. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered in sori on the underside of its leaves. This fern is notable for its unique morphology and is of interest to botanists due to its restricted geographic distribution and ecological specificity."
