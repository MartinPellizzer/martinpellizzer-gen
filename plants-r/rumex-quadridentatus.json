    "intro": "Rumex quadridentatus, commonly known as the four-toothed sorrel, is a perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive leaves, which have four prominent teeth along the margins. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in terminal spikes. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats."
