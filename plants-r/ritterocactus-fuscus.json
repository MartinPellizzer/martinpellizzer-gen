    "intro": "Ritterocactus fuscus, commonly known as the dark ritter cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a columnar cactus with a distinctive dark green to bluish-gray stem that often features a waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers during the spring and early summer. Its spines are typically short and yellowish, providing protection from herbivores. Ritterocactus fuscus is well adapted to drought conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems."
