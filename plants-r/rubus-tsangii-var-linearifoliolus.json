    "intro": "Rubus tsangii var. linearifoliolus, commonly known as the linear-leaved blackberry, is a variant of the Rubus genus native to China. It is characterized by its slender, linear leaves with a distinctively elongated shape. The plant produces small, dark purple berries that are typically harvested in late summer. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forest understories or on rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
