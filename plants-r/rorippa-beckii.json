    "intro": "Rorippa beckii, commonly known as the Beck's watercress, is a small, aquatic or semi-aquatic flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist environments such as stream banks, ditches, and wet meadows. The plant has slender, branched stems that are often submerged or partially submerged, with small, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape. Its flowers are yellow and borne in clusters, resembling those of other members of the Brassicaceae family. Rorippa beckii is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-rich waters and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
