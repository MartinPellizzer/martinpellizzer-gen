    "intro": "Rhynchosia elegans var. grandistipulata, commonly known as the large-awned cowpea, is a tropical legume characterized by its climbing habit and trifoliate leaves. It features showy, yellow flowers with distinctive red veins, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant produces elongated, cylindrical pods that contain several elliptical seeds, typically ranging in color from white to yellow. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Botanically, it is notable for its papilionaceous flowers and its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia."
