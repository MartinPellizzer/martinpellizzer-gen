    "intro": "Rosa canina f. tenuiramalis, commonly known as the slender-stemmed dog rose, is a botanical variant of the common dog rose. It is characterized by its slender, often thornless stems and smaller, more delicate flowers compared to the typical Rosa canina. The leaves are usually more finely divided, and the plant tends to grow in open, sunny habitats. It is native to southern Europe and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils. This form is of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its unique morphological traits."
