    "intro": "Rottlera eriocarpa, commonly known as the woolly rottlera, is a shrub native to the Himalayas and parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that covers its stems and leaves, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by spherical, fleshy fruits. Its leaves are usually elliptical and have a leathery texture, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to thrive in rocky or well-drained soils. Rottlera eriocarpa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine in some regions."
