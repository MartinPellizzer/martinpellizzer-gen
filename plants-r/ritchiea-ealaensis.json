    "intro": "Ritchiea ealaensis, commonly known as the Ealaensis cycad, is a rare cycad species native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and a crown of large, pinnate leaves that can reach up to 2 meters in length. The plant produces cones, with male cones being cylindrical and female cones being ovoid, both typically appearing at the base of the stem. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to rocky soils. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
