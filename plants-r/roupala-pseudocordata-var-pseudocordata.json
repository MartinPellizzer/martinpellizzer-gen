    "intro": "Roupala pseudocordata var. pseudocordata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed roupala, is a deciduous shrub native to parts of South America. It typically grows to a height of 2\u20134 meters, featuring slender, upright stems with a rough, bark-like texture. The leaves are simple, alternate, and lanceolate, with a glossy green upper surface and a lighter underside. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by oval, woody fruits that split open to release seeds. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
