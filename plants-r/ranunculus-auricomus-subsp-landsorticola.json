    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus subsp. landsorticola, commonly known as the alpine buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to high-altitude regions of the Alps and surrounding areas. It features showy, yellow flowers with five broadly ovate petals, often adorned with a distinctive greenish-white center. The plant has smooth, hairy, or glandular stems and leaves that are palmately divided into three to five lobes. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator of alpine ecosystems."
