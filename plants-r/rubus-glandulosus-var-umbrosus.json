It is characterized by its dark, often hairy stems and leaves with a distinctive, rough texture. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits known as drupes, which are typically red or black in color. It thrives in shady, moist environments, often found in forest understories. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological studies of temperate shrublands."
