    "intro": "Rhus aromatica subsp. serotina, commonly known as smooth sumac, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 5 to 11 pairs of leaflets, and its clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in late spring. The plant produces red, fuzzy berries that are a food source for birds and other wildlife. Smooth sumac thrives in full sun to partial shade and is adaptable to various soil types, making it a common sight in woodlands and open areas. Its ornamental value and ecological importance make it a notable species in native plant gardens."
