It is characterized by its lack of bracts on the flowering stems, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically reddish in color. It is native to parts of Europe and is often found in woodland areas. This variety is less commonly cultivated than other raspberry types but is valued for its ornamental features."
