    "intro": "Rosa trachyphylla var. cremsensis, commonly known as the Cremsener Rosa, is a rare and compact shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It features dense, thorny stems and small, dark green, leathery leaves that are typically covered in a fine, whitish bloom. The plant produces fragrant, semi-double pink flowers in late spring to early summer. It is well adapted to rocky and dry soils, often growing in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific environmental requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in its native range."
