    "intro": "Rubus contractus, commonly known as the dwarf blackberry, is a species of bramble native to western North America. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, with thorny stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, dark purple berries that are edible but often described as tart and less flavorful compared to other blackberry varieties. Its flowers are white and have five petals, and it blooms in the spring. The plant thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, sunny areas."
