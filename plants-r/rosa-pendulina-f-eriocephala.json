    "intro": "Rosa pendulina f. eriocephala, commonly known as the woolly climbing rose, is a botanical variety characterized by its distinctive fuzzy, white to light pink petals. This plant is a cultivar of the Rosa pendulina species, which is native to parts of Asia, particularly China. It features long, arching stems that can climb or trail, making it suitable for trellises or hanging baskets. The flowers are typically borne in clusters and bloom in spring, adding a soft, romantic appearance to gardens. Its unique foliage, with hairy leaves, further distinguishes it from other rose varieties."
