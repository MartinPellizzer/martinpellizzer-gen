    "intro": "Rumex acetosa var. pratensis, commonly known as common sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in moist meadows, woodland edges, and along streams, thriving in fertile, well-drained soils. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with a reddish or purplish tinge, and it produces small, greenish flowers in clusters during the spring. It is characterized by its sour taste due to the presence of oxalic acid. This species is often used in traditional medicine and as a culinary herb, though caution is advised due to its potential toxicity."
