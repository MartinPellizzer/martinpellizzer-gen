    "intro": "Racosperma delibratum, commonly known as the narrow-leafed wattle, is a shrub native to Australia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, often zigzagging stems and small, bipinnate leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in racemes. Its seeds are enclosed in pods and are adapted for dispersal by wind and animals. Racosperma delibratum is often found in sandy soils and is a common component of coastal and inland shrublands."
