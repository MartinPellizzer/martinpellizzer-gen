It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, disturbed soils such as roadsides and fields. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with a waxy surface and produces small, greenish flowers in clusters. Its seeds are enclosed in three-sided, hard capsules that release them when mature. Rumex supinus is often used in traditional medicine and has been studied for its potential medicinal properties."
