    "intro": "Raphanus raphanistrum subsp. rostratus, commonly known as the rostrated radish, is a wild relative of the domesticated radish. It is a biennial plant that typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields. The plant features a taproot that can be edible, though it is often smaller and more fibrous than cultivated varieties. Its leaves are lobed and have a peppery aroma, similar to other members of the Brassicaceae family. It produces small, yellow flowers that are arranged in racemes, followed by spherical, hairy seed pods."
