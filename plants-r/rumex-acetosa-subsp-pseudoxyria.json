    "intro": "Rumex acetosa subsp. pseudoxyria, commonly known as sourgrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in grasslands, meadows, and along riverbanks. The plant features upright, often reddish stems with lance-shaped leaves that have a sour, tangy scent when crushed. Its flowers are small and clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences, producing a distinctive sour taste. This subspecies is valued for its historical use in herbal remedies and as a food source for certain wildlife species."
