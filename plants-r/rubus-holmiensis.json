    "intro": "Rubus holmiensis, commonly known as Holm's blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and thorny stems, which help it to climb and spread across the ground. The plant produces small, dark red to black berries that are typically harvested in the fall. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three leaflets that have serrated edges. Rubus holmiensis is often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and along stream banks."
