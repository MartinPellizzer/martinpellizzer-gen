    "intro": "Rhamnus boissieri, commonly known as the Boissier's buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows to a height of 2 to 5 meters, featuring thorned stems and opposite, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by dark blue, fleshy berries that are attractive to birds. Its bark is smooth and grayish, often marked with lenticels, and it has a deep root system adapted to rocky and arid soils. Rhamnus boissieri is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and visual appeal."
