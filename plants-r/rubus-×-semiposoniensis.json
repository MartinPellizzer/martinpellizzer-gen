    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 semiposoniensis, commonly known as the hybrid blackberry raspberry, is a naturally occurring hybrid between Rubus ursinus (blackberry) and Rubus chamaemorus (cloudberry). It is characterized by its red-orange fruits, which are typically smaller than those of its parent species. The plant produces compound leaves with serrated edges and thrives in moist, temperate climates. It is often found in wet meadows and along riverbanks in northern regions. Due to its unique genetic makeup, it exhibits traits of both parent species, making it an interesting subject for botanical study."
