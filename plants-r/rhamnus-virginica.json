    "intro": "Rhamnus virginica, commonly known as the common buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its dark green, oval-shaped leaves and produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring. The plant bears black, egg-shaped berries that are an important food source for birds and wildlife. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in woodlands and along streambanks. However, it can become invasive in certain areas, outcompeting native vegetation."
