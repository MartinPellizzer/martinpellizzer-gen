    "intro": "Ruscus aculeatus subsp. laxus, commonly known as the creeping butcher's broom, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features dense clusters of small, waxy, dark green leaves that form a compact, mat-like growth habit. The plant produces tiny, red berries that are attractive to birds, aiding in seed dispersal. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens and as a ground cover. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to tolerate coastal conditions and its evergreen nature."
