    "intro": "Rubus serpens var. densiglandulosus, commonly known as the dense-glandular blackberry shrub, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to parts of North America. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are edible but often have a tart flavor. It thrives in woodland areas and prefers well-drained soil. Its dense glandular hairs on stems and leaves give it a distinctive appearance and help in identifying the species."
