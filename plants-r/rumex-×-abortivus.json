    "intro": "Rumex \u00d7 abortivus, commonly known as the hybrid sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Polygonaceae family and is characterized by its broad, arrow-shaped leaves that are often reddish or purple on the underside. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread easily in moist, shady environments. Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits a range of morphological variations compared to its parent species."
