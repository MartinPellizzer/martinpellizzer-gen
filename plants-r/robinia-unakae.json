    "intro": "Robinia unakae, commonly known as the Sierra Madre acacia, is a small, evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves and yellow, fragrant flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, flat pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
