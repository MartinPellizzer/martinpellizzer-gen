    "intro": "Ribes menziesii var. ixoderme, commonly known as the red gooseberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 5 to 9 leaflets, and its clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces edible berries that transition from green to red as they ripen, usually in late summer. These berries are often used in jams and preserves due to their tart flavor. The shrub thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats."
