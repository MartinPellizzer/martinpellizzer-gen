It features spreading stems that often root at the nodes, forming a dense mat of foliage. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in shades of blue to purple, which bloom in clusters along the stems. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found near water sources such as rivers and streams."
