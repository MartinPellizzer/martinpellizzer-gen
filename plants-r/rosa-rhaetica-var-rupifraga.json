    "intro": "Rosa rhaetica var. rupifraga, commonly known as the Alpine rose, is a cold-hardy shrub native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features dense, thorny stems and is characterized by its clusters of fragrant, pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to harsh mountain environments. Its leaves are dark green, leathery, and arranged in odd-pinnate patterns, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It is often cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and striking floral display."
