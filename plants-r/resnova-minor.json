    "intro": "Resnova minor, commonly known as the lesser resnova, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of Europe. It typically grows to a height of about 10-20 centimeters and features delicate, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Resnova minor prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or shaded gardens. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a nectar source for pollinators and its use in traditional herbal medicine."
