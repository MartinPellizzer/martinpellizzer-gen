    "intro": "Rubus serpens var. commiscibilis, commonly known as the creeping blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and the production of small, dark berries. The plant features trifoliate leaves with serrated edges and thorny stems that help it cling to surfaces. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. The berries are edible but can be tart, and the plant is valued for both its ornamental and culinary uses."
