    "intro": "Rumex platycarpus, commonly known as the broad-fruited sorrel, is a perennial herb native to parts of Asia and Australia. It features alternate, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive reddish coloration on the underside. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are borne on slender, upright stems. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies in moist, shaded environments. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used traditionally in herbal medicine."
