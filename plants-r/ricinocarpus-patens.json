    "intro": "Ricinocarpus patens, commonly known as the beach hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia and the Pacific. It is a shrub or small tree that thrives in sandy or saline soils, often found in coastal dunes and mangrove forests. The plant produces showy yellow flowers with five petals, which are followed by distinctive orange or red fruits that split open to release seeds. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy surface to reduce water loss. Ricinocarpus patens plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
