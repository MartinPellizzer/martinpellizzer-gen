    "intro": "Robinia pallida, commonly known as the white locust, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and turn a striking yellow in the autumn. The plant produces fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by flat, pod-like fruits. Its root system is deep and extensive, making it drought-tolerant and adaptable to various soil types. Robinia pallida is also noted for its rapid growth and ability to fix nitrogen, which enriches the soil."
