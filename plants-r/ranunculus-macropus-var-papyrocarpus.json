It is characterized by its large, showy yellow flowers with numerous stamens and a distinctive, hairy sepal structure. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, thriving in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a waxy coating that helps repel water. The variety papyrocarpus is distinguished by its robust growth and larger floral structures compared to the typical form."
