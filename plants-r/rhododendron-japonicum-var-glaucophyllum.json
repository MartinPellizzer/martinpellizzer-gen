    "intro": "Rhododendron japonicum var. glaucophyllum, commonly known as the Japanese laurel rhododendron, is a deciduous shrub native to Japan. It features broad, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green with a waxy coating, giving them a glossy appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to purple, which bloom in late spring. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its attractive foliage and long blooming period."
