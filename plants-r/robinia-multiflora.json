    "intro": "Robinia multiflora, commonly known as the yellowwood tree, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and have a serrated edge. The tree produces clusters of fragrant, yellowish-white flowers in the spring, which are followed by long, flat pods containing seeds. Its bark is thick, flaky, and often has a reddish-brown color. Robinia multiflora is valued for its hard, durable wood and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
