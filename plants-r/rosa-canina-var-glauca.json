    "intro": "Rosa canina var. glauca, commonly known as the pale dog rose, is a variant of the dog rose native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its pale pink to white flowers and hairy stems, which distinguish it from other Rosa canina varieties. The plant produces small, red, berry-like fruits called hips, which are rich in vitamin C. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and hedgerows. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal medicine."
