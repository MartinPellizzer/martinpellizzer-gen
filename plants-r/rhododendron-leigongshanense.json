    "intro": "Rhododendron leigongshanense, commonly known as the Leigongshan rhododendron, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of pink and red. The plant thrives in cool, moist, and shaded environments, typically at high altitudes. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and limited distribution, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and climate change, it faces threats to its survival in the wild."
