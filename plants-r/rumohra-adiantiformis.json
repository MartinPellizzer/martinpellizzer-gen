    "intro": "Rumohra adiantiformis, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a member of the Marsileaceae family and is characterized by its floating, water-dwelling growth habit. It has a complex, branched rhizome system that allows it to spread across the surface of still or slow-moving freshwater bodies. The plant features small, delicate leaves that are typically arranged in a whorl, giving it a feathery appearance. Its reproductive structures include both male and female spores, which are released into the water for dispersal. Rumohra adiantiformis is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small aquatic life."
