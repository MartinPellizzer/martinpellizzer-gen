    "intro": "Roella reticulata var. dunantii, commonly known as the Dunantii nettle, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Urticaceae family. It is characterized by its finely serrated leaves and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant is native to specific regions in southern Africa, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves contain stinging hairs, a common trait among members of the nettle family. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
