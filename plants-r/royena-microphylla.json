    "intro": "Royena microphylla, commonly known as the dwarf rock fig, is a small evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It features compact, rounded growth with small, glossy, dark green leaves that are typically less than 2 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by edible, fig-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in rock gardens or as a container plant due to its drought tolerance. Its unique appearance and adaptability make it a popular choice for xeriscaping in arid regions."
