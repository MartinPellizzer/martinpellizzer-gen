    "intro": "Rudgea viburnoides subsp. megalocarpa, commonly known as the large-fruited rudgea, is a species native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is a shrub or small tree characterized by its smooth, dark bark and opposite, ovate leaves with a glossy upper surface. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by large, fleshy, red berries in the fall. These berries are an important food source for various birds and mammals in its native habitat. The species is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological role in tropical and subtropical regions."
