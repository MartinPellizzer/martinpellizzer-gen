    "intro": "Ranunculus ulbrichii, commonly known as the Ulbrich's buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features showy, bright yellow flowers with five to eight petal-like sepals, typical of the Ranunculaceae family. The plant has a hairy stem and lance-shaped leaves that are deeply lobed. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
