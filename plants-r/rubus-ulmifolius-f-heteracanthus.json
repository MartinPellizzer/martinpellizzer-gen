    "intro": "Rubus ulmifolius f. heteracanthus, commonly known as the bramble rose or blackberry bramble, is a thorny shrub native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are usually three-lobed and have a distinctive, somewhat serrated edge. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by red or black berries in the summer. Its berries are edible but often have a tart flavor, and the plant is known for its vigorous growth and ability to form dense thickets. It is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental qualities and as a source of wild berries."
