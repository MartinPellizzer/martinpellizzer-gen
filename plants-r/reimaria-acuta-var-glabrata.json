    "intro": "Reimaria acuta var. glabrata, commonly known as the smooth-tipped reindeer lichen, is a foliose lichen belonging to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its leathery, pale green to yellowish thallus with a smooth, almost hairless surface. The plant typically grows on bark, stone, or soil in temperate and boreal forest regions. It lacks distinct lobes and has a uniform, compact structure. This lichen is often found in shaded, moist environments and is used as an indicator of air quality due to its sensitivity to pollution."
