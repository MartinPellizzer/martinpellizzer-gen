It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits called drupes, which are typically red or black in color. It thrives in disturbed soils and can often be found in woodland edges or along hedgerows. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered invasive in certain regions."
