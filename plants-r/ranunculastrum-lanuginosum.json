It is a member of the Ranunculaceae family, characterized by its showy, petal-like sepals and a central cluster of stamens. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and mountain meadows. Its leaves are palmately lobed and covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The flowers are usually white or pale yellow, and they bloom in early spring."
