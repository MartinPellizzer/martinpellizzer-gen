    "intro": "Restio sparsus, commonly known as the sparse restio, is a member of the Restionaceae family, native to southern Africa. It is a perennial grass-like plant characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in coastal and sandy habitats, often in areas with high wind exposure. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, white to pale yellow flowers. Restio sparsus is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
