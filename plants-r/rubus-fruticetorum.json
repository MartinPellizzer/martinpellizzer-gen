    "intro": "Rubus fruticetorum, commonly known as the creeping raspberry, is a species of bramble native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces small, red, edible berries that are similar in taste to raspberries. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an important component of its native ecosystems."
