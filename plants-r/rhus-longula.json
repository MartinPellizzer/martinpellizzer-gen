    "intro": "Rhus longula, commonly known as the smooth sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and have a smooth, glossy texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in upright clusters, followed by orange-red, berry-like fruits that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds. Rhus longula thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and open areas. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and ecologically important species in its native habitat."
