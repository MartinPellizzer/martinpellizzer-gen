    "intro": "Rhynchosia velutina, commonly known as velvet cowpea, is a leguminous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its hairy, velvety stems and trifoliate leaves with heart-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that give way to elongated, cylindrical pods containing edible seeds. It is often cultivated for its protein-rich seeds and is adapted to grow in well-drained soils. Rhynchosia velutina is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it useful in agricultural systems."
