    "intro": "Rapuntium veronicifolium, commonly known as the marsh gentian, is a flowering plant native to wetland areas in Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-rich soils and thrives in marshy or swampy environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly serrated edge, while its stems are often hairy. The marsh gentian is an important species for pollinators and is often found in association with other wetland flora."
