    "intro": "Rhamnus nana, commonly known as dwarf buckthorn, is a small evergreen shrub native to arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. The plant has small, leathery leaves that are usually glossy and dark green, and it produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring. Its fruit is a small, black drupe that contains a single seed. Rhamnus nana is often found in tundra and subalpine habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife."
