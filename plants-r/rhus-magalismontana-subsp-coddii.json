    "intro": "Rhus magalismontana subsp. coddii, commonly known as the Codd's winged sumac, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically divided into three to five pairs of leaflets, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into red, fuzzy berries, which are an important food source for birds and wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal scrub habitats. Due to its limited range and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
