    "intro": "Ritchiea erecta, commonly known as the upright ritchiea, is a rare cycad native to the island of New Guinea. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and large, feather-like leaves that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants. Ritchiea erecta is adapted to humid, tropical climates and requires well-drained soil to thrive. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
