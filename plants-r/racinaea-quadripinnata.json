    "intro": "Racinaea quadripinnata, commonly known as the four-pinnate fern, is a tropical plant belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that are typically arranged in a pinnate pattern. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in structures called sori. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in the undergrowth of tropical forests. Its intricate leaf structure makes it a visually striking and ecologically important species in its native habitat."
