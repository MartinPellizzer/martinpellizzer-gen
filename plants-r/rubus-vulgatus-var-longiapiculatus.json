    "intro": "Rubus vulgatus var. longiapiculatus, commonly known as the long-styled blackberry, is a variant of the common blackberry species native to Europe. It is characterized by its elongated, slender pedicels and distinctive floral morphology. The plant produces dark purple to black berries that are typically smaller than those of the standard Rubus vulgatus. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in hedgerows and woodland edges. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest in both horticulture and ecological studies."
