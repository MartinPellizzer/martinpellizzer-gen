It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and small, clustered leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in sandy or muddy coastal soils and is often found in intertidal zones. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it plays a role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems."
