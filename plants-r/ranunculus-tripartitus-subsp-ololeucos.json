    "intro": "Ranunculus tripartitus subsp. ololeucos, commonly known as the pale-leaved buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and stream banks. The plant features delicate, trifoliate leaves with a waxy coating, and its flowers are yellow with prominent green sepals. It blooms from late spring to early summer, producing showy, cup-shaped flowers. The subspecies is distinguished by its pale greenish-yellow petals and reduced leaf size compared to the typical form."
