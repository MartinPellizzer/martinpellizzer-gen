    "intro": "Ranunculus ponojensis, commonly known as the Pohnpei buttercup, is a flowering plant native to the island of Pohnpei in the Caroline Islands. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three deeply lobed leaflets, and it produces small, hairy fruits that contain several seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
