    "intro": "Ranunculus cymbalaria subsp. sarmentosus, commonly known as the trailing water crowfoot, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland and marshy environments. It features delicate, trifoliate leaves that are often submerged or floating, adapted to aquatic conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers with five petals, typically blooming in early spring. Its stems are often prostrate or trailing, allowing it to spread across the water surface. This subspecies is characterized by its ability to thrive in nutrient-rich, slow-moving waters."
