    "intro": "Rhynchopappus foetidus, commonly known as the stinking ragwort, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in areas with poor soil conditions. Its leaves are usually hairy and have a strong, unpleasant odor, which contributes to its common name. Rhynchopappus foetidus is known for its yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall."
