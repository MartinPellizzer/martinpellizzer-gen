    "intro": "Rheedia thouvenotii, commonly known as the Madagascar orchid, is a rare and endangered species native to the island of Madagascar. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its unique, fragrant flowers that bloom in a spiral pattern. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest undergrowth. Its leaves are elongated and strap-like, and it produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are pollinated by specific insect species. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Rheedia thouvenotii is critically endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
