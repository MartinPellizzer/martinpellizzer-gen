    "intro": "Rourea minor subsp. microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved rourea, is a shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It features small, ovate leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by woody, spherical fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
