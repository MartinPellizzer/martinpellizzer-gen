    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 substrictus, commonly known as the blackberry bramble, is a hybrid plant within the Rubus genus. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves, which are typical of many brambles. The plant produces aggregate fruits, known as berries, that are typically dark purple to black in color. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils. Its botanical features make it both a valuable food source for wildlife and a challenging weed in agricultural settings."
