    "intro": "Rhinanthus aestivalis, commonly known as the common tickseed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, which includes many parasitic and hemiparasitic species. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and heaths, often in nutrient-poor soils. Its bright yellow flowers, which appear in late spring to early summer, are arranged in dense spikes and attract various pollinators. Rhinanthus aestivalis plays a role in supporting biodiversity by providing nectar for insects and serving as a food source for certain herbivores."
