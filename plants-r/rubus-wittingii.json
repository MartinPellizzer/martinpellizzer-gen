    "intro": "Rubus wittingii, commonly known as the Witting's blackberry, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is native to parts of East Asia, particularly China, where it grows in woodland and shrubland habitats. The plant is characterized by its thorny stems, trifoliate leaves, and aggregate fruits that develop from multiple small drupes. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, and it produces edible berries that are similar to other blackberry species. Due to its ornamental value and potential for cultivation, it is sometimes grown in gardens and botanical collections."
