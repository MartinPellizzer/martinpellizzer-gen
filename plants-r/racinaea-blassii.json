    "intro": "Racinaea blassii, commonly known as the Blass's spider orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its unique, spider-like appearance, with long, thin petals that resemble the legs of a spider. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on tree trunks or in the undergrowth of dense forests. Its flowers are usually small and fragrant, blooming in clusters during the wet season. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Racinaea blassii is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
