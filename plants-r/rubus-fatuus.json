    "intro": "Rubus fatuus, commonly known as the \"fool's huckleberry,\" is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is a trailing shrub that produces small, red, edible berries. The plant is native to the western United States and parts of Canada, often found in dry, rocky soils. Its flowers are typically white or pink, and they appear in clusters. The plant's common name reflects its deceptive appearance, as the berries can be mistaken for other edible fruits."
