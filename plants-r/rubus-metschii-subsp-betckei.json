    "intro": "Rubus metschii subsp. betckei, commonly known as the Betche's blackberry, is a shrub native to Central America, particularly found in Mexico and parts of Guatemala. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark red to black in color. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in shaded forest understories. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and less-studied species within the Rubus genus."
