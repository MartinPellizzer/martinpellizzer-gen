It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black in color. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils. Due to its hardy nature, it is both ecologically significant and occasionally considered invasive in certain regions."
