    "intro": "Rudgea crassiloba, commonly known as the thick-leaved rudgea, is a shrub native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its often arid habitat. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in the spring. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family, which includes many species of shrubs and trees. Rudgea crassiloba is often found in rocky or mountainous terrain, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
