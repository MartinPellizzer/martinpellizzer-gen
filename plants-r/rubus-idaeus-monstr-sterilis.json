    "intro": "Rubus idaeus monstr. sterilis, commonly known as the sterile raspberry. This variant of the raspberry plant is notable for its inability to produce viable seeds, making it a unique subject in botanical studies. It retains the characteristic bracts and fruit structure of typical Rubus species but lacks the genetic capacity for sexual reproduction. The plant's morphology closely resembles its fertile relatives, with similar leaf shapes and thorn patterns. Its study provides insights into the genetic mechanisms behind sterility in plants."
