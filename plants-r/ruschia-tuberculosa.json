    "intro": "Ruschia tuberculosa, commonly known as the woolly Ruschia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features fleshy, cylindrical leaves that are covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a striking addition to succulent collections."
