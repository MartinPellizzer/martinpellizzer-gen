    "intro": "Rhabdothamnus scabrosus, commonly known as the roughleaf thamnus, is a shrub native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its densely hairy, often prickly leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in late summer. The plant thrives in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its structure is typically low-growing with multiple stems, and it produces small, woody fruits that are dispersed by wind. Rhabdothamnus scabrosus is an important component of local ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various native animals."
