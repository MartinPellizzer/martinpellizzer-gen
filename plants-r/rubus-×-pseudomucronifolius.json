    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 pseudomucronifolius, commonly known as the blackberry raspberry, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Rubus ursinus (the raspberry) and Rubus chamaemorus (the cloudberry). It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or black when ripe, containing numerous tiny drupes. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in moist, acidic soils. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for both ornamental and culinary purposes."
