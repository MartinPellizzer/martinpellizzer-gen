    "intro": "Rosa canina sphaerica, commonly known as the spherical dog rose, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Rosa canina (dog rose) and Rosa sphaerica (globular rose). It is characterized by its compact, rounded growth habit and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white. The plant has serrated, dark green leaves and develops red-orange hips, which are rich in vitamin C. It is typically found in temperate regions and thrives in well-drained soil with partial sunlight. Due to its ornamental value and historical use in herbal medicine, it is cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
