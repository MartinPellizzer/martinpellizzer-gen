    "intro": "Rubus saboiensis, commonly known as the Sabo raspberry, is a species of brambles native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or black in color, similar to other raspberry species. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and full sun exposure. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and less commonly cultivated plant."
