    "intro": "Rhadamanthus montanus, commonly known as the mountain rhadamanthus, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of South America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, humid environments. Its foliage consists of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Rhadamanthus montanus is considered a rare and endangered species."
