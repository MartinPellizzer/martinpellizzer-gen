It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with three to five leaflets. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black when ripe. Its fuzzy, hairy texture is a distinguishing feature, particularly on the stems and undersides of the leaves. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils."
