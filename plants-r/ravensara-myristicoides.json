    "intro": "Ravensara myristicoides, commonly known as the golden sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to the Pacific Islands. It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its aromatic, oily wood and glossy, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers followed by oval, woody fruits containing reddish-brown seeds. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or lowland rainforest habitats. Due to overharvesting, it is now classified as endangered in many regions."
