    "intro": "Rapanea lorentziana, commonly known as the Lorentzian holly, is a small evergreen shrub native to the island of Madagascar. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by bright red berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and unique appearance, it is occasionally cultivated in tropical gardens."
