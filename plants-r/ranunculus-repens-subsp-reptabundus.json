    "intro": "Ranunculus repens subsp. reptabundus, commonly known as the spreading buttercup, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically features bright yellow flowers with five petals, and its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three deeply lobed leaflets. The plant thrives in moist, often calcareous soils and is often found in wet meadows, ditches, and along riverbanks. It spreads by means of rhizomes, allowing it to form dense mats that can dominate its habitat. This subspecies is notable for its adaptability and ability to colonize disturbed or wet environments."
