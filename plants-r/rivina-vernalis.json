    "intro": "Rivina vernalis, commonly known as spring beauty, is a flowering plant native to eastern North America. It is a low-growing perennial that typically reaches heights of 5 to 15 centimeters. The plant features slender, hairy stems and produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers in early spring. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Rivina vernalis thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks."
