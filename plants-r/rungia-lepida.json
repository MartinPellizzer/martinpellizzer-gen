It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming during the rainy season. Rungia lepida is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
