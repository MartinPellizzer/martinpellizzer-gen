    "intro": "Richella caesia, commonly known as the purple sandverbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, rocky soils, often in desert or semi-desert environments. The plant features small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to purple, depending on the variety. Its leaves are usually narrow and grayish-green, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Richella caesia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
