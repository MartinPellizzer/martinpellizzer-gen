    "intro": "Romanzoffia sitchensis, commonly known as the Sitka willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the coastal regions of Alaska and western Canada. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by elongated, cylindrical fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and along streambanks. Romanzoffia sitchensis plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
