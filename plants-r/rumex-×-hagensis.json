    "intro": "Rumex \u00d7 hagensis, commonly known as the hybrid sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Polygonaceae family. It is a natural hybrid between Rumex acetosa (common sorrel) and Rumex acetobursa-marinera (water sorrel), resulting in a plant with distinctive botanical characteristics. The leaves are typically heart-shaped with a reddish coloration, and the plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits variability in morphology and is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions."
