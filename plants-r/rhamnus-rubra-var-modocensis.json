    "intro": "Rhamnus rubra var. modocensis, commonly known as Modoc greasewood, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its small, oval leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by small, leathery fruits. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to harsh, high-altitude conditions. This species plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for wildlife."
