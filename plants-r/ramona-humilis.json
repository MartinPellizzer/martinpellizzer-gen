    "intro": "Ramona humilis, commonly known as the low ramona or desert ramona, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, five-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, thriving in sandy or rocky soils. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Ramona humilis is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
