    "intro": "Rumex durispissimus, commonly known as the rough dock, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are covered in small, stiff hairs, giving it a rough texture. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in early summer. Its root system is extensive and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in moist, disturbed soils. Rumex durispissimus is often found in wetlands, along stream banks, and in other areas with high soil moisture."
