    "intro": "Rhamnus sphaerosperma var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy globe buckthorn, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, thorny branches and small, elliptical leaves that are covered in fine, pubescent hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by distinctive, globe-shaped fruits that are typically dark purple when mature. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland shrubland habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in horticulture for erosion control and as a decorative plant."
