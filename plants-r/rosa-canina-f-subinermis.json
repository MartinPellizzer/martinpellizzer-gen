    "intro": "Rosa canina f. subinermis, commonly known as the soft-husked dog rose, is a botanical variant of the dog rose species. It is characterized by its softer, less rigid fruit husks compared to the typical Rosa canina. The plant produces pink to white flowers that bloom in early summer. Its leaves are compound, with five to seven leaflets, and it is typically found in woodland and scrub habitats. This form is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in hedgerows and gardens."
