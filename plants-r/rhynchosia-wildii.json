    "intro": "Rhynchosia wildii, commonly known as the African bean or wild African bean, is a climbing legume native to tropical Africa. It produces small, yellow flowers and bean-like pods that contain edible seeds. The plant is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and twining stems, which help it climb and spread in its natural habitat. Rhynchosia wildii is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in both moist and dry conditions. It is valued for its nutritional seeds and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
