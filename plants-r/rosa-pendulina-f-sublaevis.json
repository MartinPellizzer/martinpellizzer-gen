    "intro": "Rosa pendulina f. sublaevis, commonly known as the silky pendulous rose, is a botanical variant characterized by its soft, fuzzy foliage and delicate, drooping stems. This form exhibits a more open growth habit compared to the typical Rosa pendulina, with leaves that are broader and less serrated. The flowers are usually pale pink to white, with a subtle fragrance, and bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for gardeners seeking a graceful, ornamental plant. Its unique appearance and manageable size make it suitable for both container gardening and small garden spaces."
