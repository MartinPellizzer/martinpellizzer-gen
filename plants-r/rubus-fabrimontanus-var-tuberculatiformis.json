    "intro": "Rubus fabrimontanus var. tuberculatiformis, commonly known as the tuberculate raspberry, is a variant of the raspberry genus characterized by its unique thorn structure and fruit morphology. It is native to specific regions of South America, where it thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red when ripe, with a slightly tart flavor. Its leaves are serrated and have a slightly hairy texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This variant is of interest to botanists due to its unique genetic traits and potential for hybridization with other Rubus species."
