    "intro": "Rubus rhombifolius microgene libertianus, commonly known as the Libertian raspberry, is a rare shrub native to the high-altitude regions of western South America. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its biennial growth habit, with flowering occurring on the first year's growth. The plant produces small, red, aggregate fruits that are typically consumed by local wildlife. Its leaves are rhombic in shape, with a coarse texture and serrated margins. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
