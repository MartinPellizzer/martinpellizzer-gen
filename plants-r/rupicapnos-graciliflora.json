    "intro": "Rupicapnos graciliflora, commonly known as the slender-flowered rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with fleshy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring, often in clusters along the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
