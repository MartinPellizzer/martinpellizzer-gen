    "intro": "Rhamnus atroviridis, commonly known as the blackthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dark, thorny stems and small, oval leaves that are usually glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by black, oval berries in the autumn. These berries are edible but have a high acidity and are often used in culinary or medicinal applications. Rhamnus atroviridis is also valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological importance, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
