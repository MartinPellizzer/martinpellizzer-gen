    "intro": "Rhododendron radinum, commonly known as the alpine rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Asia, particularly in the Himalayas. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often appearing in clusters. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to withstand harsh alpine conditions. Rhododendron radinum plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing nectar for pollinators and shelter for small animals."
