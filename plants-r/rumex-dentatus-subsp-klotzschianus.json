It is characterized by its distinctive serrated leaves, which are typically broad and lance-shaped. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in wet meadows and along stream banks. Its botanical features make it a common species in wetland ecosystems and a subject of interest in ecological studies."
