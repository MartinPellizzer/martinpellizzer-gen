    "intro": "Rosa dumalis var. suberiostyla, commonly known as the Alaskan rose, is a rare and cold-hardy shrub native to the northern regions of North America. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. The plant features fragrant, pink to white flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with serrated edges, and it produces red or orange hips in the fall. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable species for botanical research and conservation efforts."
