    "intro": "Rheum uninerve, commonly known as the narrow-veined rhubarb, is a perennial plant native to the Himalayas. It is characterized by its large,\u621f-shaped leaves with a single central vein, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in spring. Its rhubarb-like stalks are edible but typically not consumed due to their tart flavor. Botanically, it belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes other plants such as buckwheat and sorrel."
