    "intro": "Rhododendron viscosum var. ornatum, commonly known as the sticky alpine rhododendron, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and showy clusters of pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are often covered in a sticky resin, which helps protect it from herbivores and environmental stress. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with suitable growing conditions."
