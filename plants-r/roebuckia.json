    "intro": "Roebuckia, commonly known as the \"skeleton plant,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. These plants are native to southern Africa and are characterized by their unique, spiny, and often woody stems. The leaves are typically small, narrow, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a distinctive appearance. Roebuckia species produce showy, yellow or orange flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators like bees and birds. Due to their striking appearance and drought tolerance, they are popular in xeriscaping and rock gardens."
