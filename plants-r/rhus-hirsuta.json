It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are opposite and have serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into red, fuzzy berries. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in woodland edges and open areas. Rhus hirsuta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine."
