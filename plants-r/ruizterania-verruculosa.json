    "intro": "Ruizterania verruculosa, commonly known as the roughleaf ruizterania, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to parts of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its woody stems and hairy, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Ruizterania verruculosa is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies on plant morphology and ecological adaptation."
