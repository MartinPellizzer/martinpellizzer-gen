It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, often colorful inflorescences. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories. Its leaves are usually broad and lance-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps retain moisture. The flowers, which bloom in the spring, are clustered in umbels and attract various pollinators like bees and butterflies."
