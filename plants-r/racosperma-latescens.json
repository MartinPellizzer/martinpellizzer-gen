It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its bipinnate leaves and yellow flowers. The plant is adapted to arid environments, with small, waxy leaves that reduce water loss. It produces pods that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils."
