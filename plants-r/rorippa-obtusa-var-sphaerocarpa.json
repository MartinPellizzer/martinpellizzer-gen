    "intro": "Rorippa obtusa var. sphaerocarpa, commonly known as the globe-shaped watercress, is a variant of the watercress species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist or aquatic environments, such as ponds and stream margins. The plant features small, rounded leaves that are often clustered at the base, and its flowers are yellow and borne in clusters. It produces small, round seeds that are dispersed by water, aiding in its spread. The botanical characteristics of this variety make it well adapted to wetland habitats and contribute to its ecological significance."
