It is characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped leaves and pale green to white flowers with a distinctive spurred lip. Native to parts of Europe and Asia, it thrives in shaded, moist woodlands and often grows in association with other woodland flora. The plant has a rhizomatous root system and produces a single flower spike per stem. It is noted for its ability to colonize disturbed sites and its role in supporting pollinators in its native habitat."
