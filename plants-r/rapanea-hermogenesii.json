It belongs to the family Lauraceae, which includes laurels and cinnamon trees. The plant is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage with small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green. It produces small, fragrant flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
