It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically less than 2 centimeters in length, giving it its variety name \"microphylla,\" meaning \"small leaf.\" The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in clusters during late spring, followed by small, black berries in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or rocky areas. Its compact size and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for garden landscapes."
