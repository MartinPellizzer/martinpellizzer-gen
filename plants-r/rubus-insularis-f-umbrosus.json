    "intro": "Rubus insularis f. umbrosus, commonly known as the shaded raspberry, is a shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is a variant of the common raspberry, characterized by its darker, more compact growth habit and smaller, often reddish fruits. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest understories. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated margins, and its flowers are pale pink to white. This form is notable for its adaptation to low-light conditions, making it a valuable species for ecological restoration in shaded habitats."
