It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and showy clusters of pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils and thrives in shaded to partially shaded environments. Its leaves are leathery and elliptical, while its stems are often woody and covered in a thick, fuzzy layer.
