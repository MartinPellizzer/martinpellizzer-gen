    "intro": "Rosa beggeriana var. inermis, commonly known as the smoothleaf rock rose, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and thornless stems, which distinguish it from other rose species. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a smooth, glossy texture, contributing to its ornamental value. It is well adapted to rocky and arid environments, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
