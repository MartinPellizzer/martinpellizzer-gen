    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus subsp. kitinensis, commonly known as the Kitinense buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features showy, yellow flowers with five broadly ovate petals that are often tinged with red or brown at the base. The plant has compound, trifoliate leaves that are finely divided and covered in a dense layer of soft, silky hairs. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is sensitive to frost and requires well-drained soil."
