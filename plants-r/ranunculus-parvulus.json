    "intro": "Ranunculus parvulus, commonly known as the lesser celandine, is a small perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features a short, hairy stem with palmately divided leaves that are usually bright yellow-green in color. Its flowers are small, with 5 to 7 sepals and no true petals, and they bloom in early spring. The plant is known for its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes, making it both a common weed and a valuable early-season nectar source for pollinators."
