    "intro": "Rubus longissimus, commonly known as the long-stemmed blackberry, is a species of brambles native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its woody stems, which can grow up to several meters in length, and its compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces aggregate fruits composed of tiny drupelets, which are typically dark purple to black in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in hedgerows, woodland edges, and disturbed areas. The plant is valued for its edible berries, which have a tart flavor and are used in culinary applications."
