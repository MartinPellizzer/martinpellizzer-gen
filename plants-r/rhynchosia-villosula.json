It features compound leaves with small, hairy leaflets and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is notable for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with Rhizobium bacteria in its root nodules. Its pods contain edible seeds that are used in traditional cuisines and also have medicinal applications. Rhynchosia villosula is often cultivated for both its nutritional value and ornamental appeal."
