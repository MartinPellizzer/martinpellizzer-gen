    "intro": "Rubus penetrans, commonly known as the creeping raspberry, is a species of bramble belonging to the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and thorny stems, which allow it to spread across ground surfaces. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or black when mature. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Rubus penetrans is often found in woodland areas and along stream banks, where it plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various wildlife."
