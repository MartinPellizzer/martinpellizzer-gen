    "intro": "Rosa coriifolia subvar. pseudopsis, commonly known as the Japanese rose or the white-leafed rose, is a deciduous shrub native to East Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that range from white to pink, typically appearing in early spring. The plant has pinnately compound leaves with finely toothed margins, and its stems are often covered in thorns. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. The subvariety pseudopsis is distinguished by its larger, more showy flowers compared to the typical form of R. coriifolia."
