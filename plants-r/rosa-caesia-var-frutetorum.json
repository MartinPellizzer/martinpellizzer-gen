    "intro": "Rosa caesia var. frutetorum, commonly known as the pink-flowered shrub rose, is a compact, deciduous shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, fragrant pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has thorny stems and dark green, glossy foliage that provides a striking contrast to its delicate blooms. It is well-suited for rock gardens or as a border plant due to its compact size and ornamental value. The leaves are simple, alternate, and have a leathery texture, typical of many rose species."
