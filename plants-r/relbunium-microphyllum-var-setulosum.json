    "intro": "Relbunium microphyllum var. setulosum, commonly known as the hairy-leaved relbunium, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are densely covered with fine, hair-like structures, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grassland or rocky habitats. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
