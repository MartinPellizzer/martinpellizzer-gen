    "intro": "Rotala densiflora f. diffusa, commonly known as the dense-flowered water lettuce, is a floating aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It features broad, waxy leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern on the water's surface. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, adding ornamental value to pond ecosystems. It thrives in warm, slow-moving waters with moderate light exposure. Its dense foliage helps in oxygenating the water and providing habitat for aquatic life."
