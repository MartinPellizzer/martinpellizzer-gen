    "intro": "Ricinus communis var. rheedianus, commonly known as the Rheedian croton, is a variant of the castor oil plant. It is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves with deep lobes and a vibrant green color. The plant produces unique, spiky seed capsules that contain toxic seeds, making it potentially hazardous to handle. It thrives in warm, tropical climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value rather than for its oil-producing properties."
