    "intro": "Rosa \u00d7 fraseriana, commonly known as the Fraser hybrid rose, is a deciduous shrub native to China. It is a hybrid between Rosa chinensis and Rosa multiflora, resulting in a plant with strong disease resistance and vigorous growth. The plant produces fragrant, semi-double to fully double flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its thorny stems and dense foliage make it suitable for hedging and ornamental landscaping. The leaves are dark green, glossy, and oval-shaped, providing year-round visual interest."
