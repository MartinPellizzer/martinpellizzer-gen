    "intro": "Rhinanthus minor subsp. elatior, commonly known as the greater yellow rocket, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Orobanchaceae. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It typically grows in disturbed soils and open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. Its distribution includes much of Europe and parts of Asia, where it plays a role in supporting pollinators."
