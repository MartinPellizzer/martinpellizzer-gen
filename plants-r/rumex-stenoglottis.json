It is characterized by its upright, branched stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, which are typically arranged in dense, terminal spikes. Its leaves are used in traditional medicine for their astringent properties. Rumex stenoglottis thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and along stream banks."
