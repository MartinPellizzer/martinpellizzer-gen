    "intro": "Ranunculus eastwoodianus, commonly known as Eastwood's buttercup, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, showy flowers with five to eight petals. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are trifoliate, with finely divided lobes, and it produces a distinctive yellow flower that blooms in early summer. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
