    "intro": "Ranunculus constantinopolitanus var. villosus, commonly known as the hairy Persian buttercup, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which give it its varietal name \"villosus.\" The plant produces showy, yellow or orange flowers with five petals, typical of the Ranunculaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain environments."
