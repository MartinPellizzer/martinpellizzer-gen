    "intro": "Rhododendron hirsutum var. ciliatum, commonly known as the hairy leaved rhododendron, is a compact evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of China. It features dense, dark green foliage with a distinctive hairy texture on both the upper and lower surfaces of the leaves. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to red, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It prefers acidic, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and long-lasting blooms."
