It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, including marshes and along the edges of ponds and streams. It has heart-shaped leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, yellowish-white flowers in clusters. This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic insects."
