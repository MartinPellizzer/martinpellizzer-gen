It is characterized by its elliptical, medium-sized leaves and clusters of small, pale pink to white flowers. The plant is native to parts of Asia, particularly China, and thrives in temperate climates. Unlike many other roses, it lacks a strong fragrance, which distinguishes it from its more aromatic relatives. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and adaptability to various garden conditions."
