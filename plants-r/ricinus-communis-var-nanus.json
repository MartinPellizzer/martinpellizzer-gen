    "intro": "Ricinus communis var. nanus, commonly known as the dwarf castor plant, is a compact variety of the castor oil plant. It is a shrub-like plant native to tropical regions and is characterized by its palmate leaves with prominent veins. The plant produces spiny capsules that contain toxic seeds, which are not suitable for human consumption. It thrives in warm climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
