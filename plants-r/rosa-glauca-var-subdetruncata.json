    "intro": "Rosa glauca var. subdetruncata, commonly known as the blue rose or glaucous rose, is a rare and ornamental shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its pale blue to white petals, which give it a striking and ethereal appearance. The plant typically grows to a height of 1\u20132 meters, with thorny stems and small, dark green leaves. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, producing a delicate fragrance. Due to its limited natural range and susceptibility to environmental stress, it is considered a rare and endangered species in the wild."
