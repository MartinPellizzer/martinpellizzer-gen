    "intro": "Rubus hirtus subsp. declivis, commonly known as the trailing blackberry, is a shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and prickly stems, which help it anchor to surfaces. The plant produces small, white to pink flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible berries in the summer. Its leaves are typically trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the plant is often found in moist, wooded areas. The subspecies is distinguished by its more prostrate growth form compared to other Rubus species."
