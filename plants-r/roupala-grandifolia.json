    "intro": "Roupala grandifolia, commonly known as the large-leaf roupala, is a deciduous tree native to the temperate rainforests of South America. It belongs to the family Proteaceae and is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The tree produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in spherical inflorescences, which are visited by various pollinators. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its role in forest regeneration. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
