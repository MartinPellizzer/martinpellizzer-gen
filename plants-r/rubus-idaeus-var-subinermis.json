    "intro": "Rubus idaeus var. subinermis, commonly known as the smooth raspberry, is a variant of the red raspberry plant characterized by its smooth, less hairy stems and leaves compared to the typical raspberry. It produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red when ripe, though some cultivars may yield yellow or golden berries. The plant is a shrub with thornless stems, making it easier to handle than its more prickly relatives. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its flavorful berries used in jams, desserts, and beverages. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and edible fruit, making it a popular choice for both gardeners and commercial growers."
