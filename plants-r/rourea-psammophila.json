    "intro": "Rourea psammophila, commonly known as the sandstone rourea, is a shrub native to arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is adapted to thrive in sandy or rocky soils, making it resilient to drought. Rourea psammophila is often found in coastal and inland dune ecosystems, contributing to stabilizing sand dunes and preventing erosion."
