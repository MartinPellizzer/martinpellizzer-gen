It is characterized by its distinctive, fragrant, yellow pea-like flowers that appear in clusters. The leaves are bipinnate, consisting of multiple pairs of small, oval-shaped leaflets. This form is notable for its compact growth habit compared to the typical black locust. It is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its showy blooms and hardy nature."
