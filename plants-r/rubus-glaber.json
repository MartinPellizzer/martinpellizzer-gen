    "intro": "Rubus glaber, commonly known as the smooth raspberry, is a species of bramble native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its thornless stems and aggregate fruits, which are typically red and juicy. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by the development of its edible berries. Its leaves are alternate, palmately lobed, and covered in a fine layer of hair. Rubus glaber is often found in woodlands, hedgerows, and other moist, shaded environments."
