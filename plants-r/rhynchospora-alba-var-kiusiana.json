    "intro": "Rhynchospora alba var. kiusiana, commonly known as the white tussock sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It typically grows in wetland or marshy habitats, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white or pale pink flowers in dense, spike-like clusters. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense stands in its native environment. The species is noted for its ecological importance in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
