    "intro": "Rhabdotheca sonchoides, commonly known as the narrowleaf sowthistle, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of 20\u201360 cm and features alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves with a rough, hairy texture. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a composite inflorescence, which are followed by spherical, spiny seed heads. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, along roadsides, and in waste areas. Its botanical characteristics make it a common weed in agricultural settings."
