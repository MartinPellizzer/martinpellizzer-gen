It is characterized by its reduced flowering, with fewer blooms compared to the typical Rosa canina. The plant features prickly stems and compound leaves, typical of the Rosa genus. Its flowers are usually smaller and more clustered, often displaying a pale pink to red hue. This form is often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates."
