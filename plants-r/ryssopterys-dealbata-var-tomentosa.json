    "intro": "Ryssopterys dealbata var. tomentosa, commonly known as the white-veined fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are often covered in a fine, white, velvety hair, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is typically found in forest understories. Its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into two sets of smaller leaflets, creating a complex, lacy structure. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
