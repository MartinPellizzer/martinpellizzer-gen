    "intro": "Rubus furnarius, commonly known as the common blackberry shrub, is a species of brambles native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces aggregate fruits, known as blackberries, which are typically dark purple to black when mature. These berries are rich in antioxidants and have been used historically for both culinary and medicinal purposes. Rubus furnarius thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, loamy soils in full sun to partial shade."
