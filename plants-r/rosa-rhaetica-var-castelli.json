    "intro": "Rosa rhaetica var. castelli, commonly known as the Castelli's alpine rose, is a rare and hardy shrub native to the high altitudes of the European Alps. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with dense clusters of fragrant, semi-double pink to white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant features dark green, serrated leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white down, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained, alkaline soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a botanical curiosity and a species of conservation interest."
