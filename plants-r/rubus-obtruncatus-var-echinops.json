    "intro": "Rubus obtruncatus var. echinops, commonly known as the prairie rose, is a deciduous shrub native to the central and eastern United States. It typically grows in open habitats such as prairies, woodland edges, and disturbed areas. The plant features arching stems with thorny branches and clusters of white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring. Its leaves are compound, consisting of 5 to 7 oval-shaped leaflets with serrated edges. The fruit is a red, aggregate berry that develops in late summer and is edible, though often tart and less palatable than other rose species."
