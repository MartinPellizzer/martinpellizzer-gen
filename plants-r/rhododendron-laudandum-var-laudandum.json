    "intro": "Rhododendron laudandum var. laudandum, commonly known as the laurel rhododendron, is a deciduous shrub native to the Himalayas. It features broad, leathery leaves that are dark green on top and silver-white underneath, providing striking visual contrast. The plant produces showy clusters of pink to red flowers in late spring, which are rich in nectar and attract pollinators. It thrives in cool, moist climates with partial shade and well-drained acidic soil. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often cultivated in gardens and horticultural collections."
