    "intro": "Rubus humerosus, commonly known as the broad-leaf blackberry, is a species of bramble native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its prickly stems and large, lobed leaves that are often hairy beneath. The plant produces aggregate fruits composed of small, dark purple to black drupelets. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands and along streambanks. Rubus humerosus is valued for its edible berries, which are used in jams and desserts."
