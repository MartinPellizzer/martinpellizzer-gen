    "intro": "Rufacer, commonly known as the red-faced plant, is a unique species characterized by its distinctive reddish pigmentation on its upper foliage. It belongs to the family Rutaceae and is native to arid regions of southern Africa. The plant exhibits a compact, shrub-like growth habit with small, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Rufacer is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in xeriscapes due to its drought tolerance."
