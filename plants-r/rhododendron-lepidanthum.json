    "intro": "Rhododendron lepidanthum, commonly known as the mountain rhododendron, is a species native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, often found in forested areas at elevations between 2,000 and 4,000 meters. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
