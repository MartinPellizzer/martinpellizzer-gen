    "intro": "Ranunculus ammoides, commonly known as the sand ranunculus, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is a low-growing perennial herb with a fibrous root system adapted to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces delicate, five-petaled flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, often with a distinctive yellow center. Its leaves are palmately divided, and the plant is often found growing in sandy or gravelly soils. Ranunculus ammoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil."
