It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces aggregate fruits, which are typically dark purple to black in color. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along woodland edges. Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural and natural settings."
