    "intro": "Rhinanthus pseudoantiquus, commonly known as the false antelope\u2019s horn, is a flowering plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially depends on other plants for nutrients through its root system. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
