    "intro": "Rubus hirtus var. perpetiolatus, commonly known as the evergreen bramble, is a shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, thorny growth habit and dark green, leathery leaves that remain on the plant throughout the winter. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers in the spring, followed by red, edible berries in the summer. Its evergreen nature makes it distinctive among brambles, as most species shed their leaves seasonally. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodland edges and thickets."
