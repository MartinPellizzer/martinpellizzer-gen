    "intro": "Rosa \u00d7 dumetorum subvar. ramealis, commonly known as the alpine rose, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense foliage, which helps it thrive in cold, high-altitude environments. The plant produces fragrant, pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and covered in a fine layer of white, silky hairs, which provide insulation against harsh weather. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in alpine gardens."
