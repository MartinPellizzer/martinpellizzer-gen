    "intro": "Richetia coriacea, commonly known as the roughleaf hakea, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, giving them a rough texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Richetia coriacea is adapted to arid conditions and is drought-tolerant, making it a resilient plant in its native environment."
