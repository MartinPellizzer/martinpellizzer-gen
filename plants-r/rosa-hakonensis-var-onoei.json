It is characterized by its compact growth habit and vibrant, semi-double pink flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically has dark green, serrated leaves and produces hips that are orange-red in color. It is well-suited for garden cultivation due to its hardiness and ornamental value. This variety is often appreciated for its fragrance and is used in both ornamental gardening and traditional Japanese culture."
