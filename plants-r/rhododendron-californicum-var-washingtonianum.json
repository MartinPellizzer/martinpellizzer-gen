    "intro": "Rhododendron californicum var. washingtonianum, commonly known as the Washington's rhododendron, is a compact evergreen shrub native to the western United States. It features dense, leathery foliage with deep green leaves that provide a lush backdrop for its showy floral display. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to red, typically blooming in late spring. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to form thickets, offering both aesthetic appeal and habitat for small wildlife."
