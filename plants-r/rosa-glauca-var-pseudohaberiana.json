It is native to the mountainous regions of northern Mexico, particularly in the Sierra Madre Occidental. The plant is characterized by its pale blue to lavender flowers and narrow, gray-green foliage. It is a shrub that typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
