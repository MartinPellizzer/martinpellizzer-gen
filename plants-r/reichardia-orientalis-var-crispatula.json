It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, hairy, and often curled leaves. The plant produces small, yellow composite flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along streambanks. Its leaves are used in traditional medicine for their purported diuretic and anti-inflammatory properties."
