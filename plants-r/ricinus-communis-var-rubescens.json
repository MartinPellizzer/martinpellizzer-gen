    "intro": "Ricinus communis var. rubescens, commonly known as the scarlet castor bean, is a variant of the castor oil plant characterized by its striking red foliage. This plant is native to tropical regions and thrives in warm, humid climates. Its leaves are large, palmately lobed, and often display a vibrant red or maroon coloration. The plant produces distinctive spiky green capsules that contain toxic seeds, which are used in traditional medicine and as a source of castor oil. Due to its ornamental value and potential hazards, it is often cultivated in gardens with caution."
