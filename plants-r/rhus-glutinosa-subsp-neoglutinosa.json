    "intro": "Rhus glutinosa subsp. neoglutinosa, commonly known as the smooth sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically pinnately arranged with 11 to 31 leaflets. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by bright red, berry-like fruits that persist into the winter. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained sites and full sun. The species is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in disturbed areas."
