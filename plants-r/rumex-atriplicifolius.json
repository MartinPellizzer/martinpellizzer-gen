It features basal leaves that are narrow and deeply lobed, resembling the shape of a dock leaf. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in dense clusters during the summer months. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. The leaves and roots have been historically used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
