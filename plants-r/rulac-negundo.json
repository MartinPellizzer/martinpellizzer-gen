    "intro": "Rulac negundo, commonly known as the boxwood, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and dark green, glossy leaves that remain throughout the growing season. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by red berries that are edible for birds. It is widely cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its ability to be shaped into various forms. Rulac negundo is also valued for its use in hedging and as a foundation plant in gardens."
