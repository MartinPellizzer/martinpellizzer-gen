    "intro": "Rubus hiemalis, commonly known as the winter bramble, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its prickly stems and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces red, juicy berries that ripen in the summer, which are edible but often tart. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three leaflets that are serrated along the edges. Rubus hiemalis thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and thickets."
