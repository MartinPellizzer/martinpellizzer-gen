    "intro": "Ruagea caoba, commonly known as the Cuban mahogany, is a tropical tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its large, dark green leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. The tree is valued for its dense, aromatic wood, which is highly sought after in the furniture and construction industries. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Ruagea caoba plays an important ecological role in its native habitats, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
