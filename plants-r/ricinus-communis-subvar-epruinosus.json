    "intro": "Ricinus communis subvar. epruinosus, commonly known as the velvetleaf or woolly castor bean, is a variant of the castor oil plant. It is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, giving them a velvety texture. The plant produces distinctive spiny capsules containing toxic seeds, which are used in traditional medicine and as a source of castor oil. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and potentially hazardous due to its toxic properties."
