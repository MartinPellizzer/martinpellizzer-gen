    "intro": "Rosa glauca var. diversiglandulosa, commonly known as the blue rose with diverse glands, is a variant of the blue rose species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. This plant is characterized by its striking blue to violet flower petals, which result from a unique combination of pigments and genetic traits. The leaves are typically dark green with a slightly hairy texture, and the stems are covered in thorns. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows. The plant's botanical interest lies in its genetic diversity and the unusual coloration that makes it a subject of both horticultural and scientific study."
