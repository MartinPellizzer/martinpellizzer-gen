    "intro": "Rosa puberulenta, commonly known as the hairy rose, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its thorny stems and dense, glandular hairs that give it a distinctive, rough texture. The plant produces fragrant, pink to red flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine, soft hairs, contributing to its overall appearance. Rosa puberulenta is native to regions of Europe and is often found in woodland edges and rocky areas."
