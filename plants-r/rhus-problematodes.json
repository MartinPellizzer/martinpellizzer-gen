    "intro": "Rhus problematodes, commonly known as the staghorn sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are alternately arranged and have elongated leaflets with serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by red, fuzzy fruits that attract birds and other wildlife. Its bark is thick and rugged, with a rough, fissured texture that gives it its common name. Rhus problematodes is often found in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in open woodlands."
