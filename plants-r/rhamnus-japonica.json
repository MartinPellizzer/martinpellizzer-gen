    "intro": "Rhamnus japonica, commonly known as Japanese buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to Japan and parts of eastern Asia. It typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters, featuring slender, often multi-branched stems with smooth, reddish-brown bark. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during late spring, followed by dark blue-black berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate with serrated margins, and they turn vibrant yellow in autumn. Rhamnus japonica is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often used in gardens for its seasonal interest."
