    "intro": "Rumex alpestris, commonly known as alpine sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its upright, branched stems and alternate, palmately lobed leaves that are often reddish or purple-veined. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Rumex alpestris is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
