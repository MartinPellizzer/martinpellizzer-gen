It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and alternate, simple leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by elliptical, woody fruits containing a single seed. It is often found in forest margins and rocky outcrops, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value and timber, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and for commercial purposes."
