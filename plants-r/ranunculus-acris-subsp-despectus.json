    "intro": "Ranunculus acris subsp. despectus, commonly known as the meadow buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks, preferring moist, well-drained soils. The plant features basal leaves that are deeply lobed and a showy inflorescence of yellow flowers with five petals. Its flowers open in early spring and are pollinated by insects such as bees and butterflies. The subspecies is characterized by its slightly smaller flowers and more upright growth habit compared to the typical form of Ranunculus acris."
