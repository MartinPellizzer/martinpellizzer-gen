It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant produces edible hips, which are rich in vitamin C and used in traditional medicine. Its leaves are simple and alternate, with a serrated margin, and it thrives in well-drained, acidic soils. Rosa silenidiflora is often cultivated for its ornamental value and hardy nature in temperate climates."
