It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and related plants. The plant is characterized by its tall, cylindrical inflorescence that bears small, spike-like clusters of pale green to brownish flowers. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and often have a rough or scabrous texture, giving the variety its common name. Rhynchospora gigantea var. scaberrima typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, and it plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems."
