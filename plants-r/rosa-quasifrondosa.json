    "intro": "Rosa quasifrondosa, commonly known as the near-leaf rose, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, where it thrives in rocky and arid environments. The plant is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Rosa quasifrondosa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine."
