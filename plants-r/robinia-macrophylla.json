It is characterized by its compound leaves, which can grow up to 30 inches in length, and its distinctive thorned stems. The tree produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing edible seeds. Its root system is deep and strong, making it drought-tolerant and adaptable to various soil types. The plant is also known for its fast growth and ability to fix nitrogen, improving soil fertility."
