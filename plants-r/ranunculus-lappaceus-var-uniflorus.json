It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils along stream banks and wet meadows. The plant features basal leaves that are deeply lobed and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are small, usually yellow or white, with five petals. It produces a cluster of follicles containing numerous small seeds. This variety is distinguished by its solitary flower per stem, setting it apart from other varieties of Ranunculus lappaceus."
