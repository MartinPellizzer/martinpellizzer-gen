    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 semisaxicola, commonly known as the alpine blackberry, is a hybrid species within the Rubus genus. It is characterized by its thorny stems and aggregate fruits, which are typically dark purple to black in color. This plant is native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia, where it thrives in rocky and well-drained soils. It is a deciduous shrub that produces small, edible berries, though they are often less flavorful compared to other Rubus species. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for ornamental purposes."
