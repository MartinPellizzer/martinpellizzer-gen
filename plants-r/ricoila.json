    "intro": "Ricoila, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often green or yellow in color. Ricoila is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and agricultural fields. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
