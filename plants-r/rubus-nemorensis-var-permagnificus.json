    "intro": "Rubus nemorensis var. permagnificus, commonly known as the Giant Velvet Raspberry, is a rare and striking variant of the Rubus genus. It is characterized by its large, velvety leaves and clusters of showy, dark red flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces edible berries that are notably larger and sweeter than those of the standard Rubus nemorensis. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in temperate forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and unique features, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical study and conservation efforts."
