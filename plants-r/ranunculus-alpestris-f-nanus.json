    "intro": "Ranunculus alpestris f. nanus, commonly known as the dwarf alpine buttercup, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine regions of Europe. It features delicate, bright yellow flowers with 5-7 sepals that are often mistaken for petals. The plant typically grows to a height of only a few centimeters, making it well adapted to rocky and poor soil conditions. Its leaves are palmately divided and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. This cultivar is prized in horticulture for its compact size and vibrant floral display."
