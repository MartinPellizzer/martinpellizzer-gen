    "intro": "Ranunculus duclouxii, commonly known as the Ducloux buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family, characterized by its showy, typically yellow or white flowers with five to eight petals. The plant has palmately divided leaves that are covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats, where it blooms in late spring to early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected species in some regions."
