    "intro": "Rubus foliolosus var. racemosus, commonly known as the racemose raspberry, is a shrub native to the temperate regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically trifoliate or pinnate, with serrated margins. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. Its fruits, which are aggregate berries, develop from the flowering clusters and are often consumed by wildlife. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators and birds."
