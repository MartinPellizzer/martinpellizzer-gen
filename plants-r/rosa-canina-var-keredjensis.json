    "intro": "Rosa canina var. keredjensis, commonly known as the Keredjens rose, is a rare variant of the dog rose native to specific regions in Eastern Europe. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and clusters of small, fragrant pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces red-orange hips, which are rich in vitamin C and used in traditional herbal medicine. Its leaves are compound, with five to seven elliptical leaflets, and it thrives in well-drained, acidic soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
