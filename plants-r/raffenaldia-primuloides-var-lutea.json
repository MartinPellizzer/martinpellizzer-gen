It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and alternate leaves. The plant features showy yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its foliage is typically covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Raffenaldia primuloides var. lutea is often found in rocky soils and alpine meadows, where it thrives in cool, sunny conditions."
