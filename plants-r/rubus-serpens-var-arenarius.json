    "intro": "Rubus serpens var. arenarius, commonly known as the sand raspberry, is a flowering plant species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its trailing growth habit and small, thornless stems. The plant produces clusters of white to pale yellow flowers, which are followed by small, edible berries. Its leaves are typically trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. Due to its drought tolerance, it is often found in disturbed areas and along roadsides."
