    "intro": "Robinia hispida var. rosea, commonly known as the rosehip tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and covered in fine, stiff hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in racemes, followed by distinctive red, fuzzy fruits called follicles. These fruits contain small, edible seeds enclosed in a hairy capsule. The rosehip tree is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal medicine."
