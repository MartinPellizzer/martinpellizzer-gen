    "intro": "Rhynchosia nitida, commonly known as the slender cowpea, is a climbing legume native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features trifoliate leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellow flowers that develop into slender, curved pods. The plant is characterized by its delicate, hairless stems and is often found in disturbed habitats such as fields and along roadsides. It is valued for its edible seeds, which are used in various cuisines, and for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. Rhynchosia nitida is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
