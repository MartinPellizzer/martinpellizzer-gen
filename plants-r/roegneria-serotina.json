    "intro": "Roegneria serotina, commonly known as the late-fruiting wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, exhibiting a clump-forming growth habit. The plant produces its inflorescence, a spike-like structure, in late summer to early autumn, which gives it its common name. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration, and the plant is often used in ecological restoration projects. Roegneria serotina is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity in natural habitats."
