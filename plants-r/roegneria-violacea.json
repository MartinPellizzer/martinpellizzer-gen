    "intro": "Roegneria violacea, commonly known as the purple false brome, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features slender, upright stems that bear narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a distinctive purplish hue, especially at the base. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, two-lobed flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and rocky areas. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
