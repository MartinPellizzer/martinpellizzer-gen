    "intro": "Ranunculus uniflorus, commonly known as the single-flowered buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features a basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves with finely toothed margins. The plant produces a single, showy yellow flower with five to eight sepals that resemble petals. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens but is considered invasive in some regions."
