    "intro": "Rhamnus colubrina, commonly known as coastal buckthorn, is a shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and lance-shaped leaves that turn reddish in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in the spring, which are followed by dark blue berries that are an important food source for birds and small mammals. It thrives in coastal areas and sandy soils, often growing in maritime hammocks and dunes. Rhamnus colubrina is also valued for its hardiness and ability to stabilize coastal ecosystems."
