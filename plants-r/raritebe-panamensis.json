    "intro": "Raritebe panamensis, commonly known as the Panama rare vine, is a tropical plant native to the humid lowland forests of Central America. It is characterized by its climbing habit, with long, flexible stems that can reach lengths of several meters. The plant features heart-shaped, glossy leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow. Its fruit is a fleshy, orange-colored berry that contains several seeds. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, Raritebe panamensis is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
