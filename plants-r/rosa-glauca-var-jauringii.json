    "intro": "Rosa glauca var. jauringii, commonly known as the Jauringii rose, is a rare and ornamental shrub native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its pale blue to white flowers, which bloom in early summer, and its silver-green foliage that provides a striking contrast. The plant typically grows in rocky and alpine environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions with well-drained soil. It is valued for its unique appearance and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its aesthetic and ecological significance. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
