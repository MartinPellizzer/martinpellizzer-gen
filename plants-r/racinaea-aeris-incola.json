    "intro": "Racinaea aeris-incola, commonly known as the cloud-dwelling orchid, is a rare epiphytic plant native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It thrives in high-altitude environments where mist and humidity are constant, allowing it to absorb moisture through its roots and aerial structures. The plant's leaves are modified into fleshy, scale-like structures that store water, while its flowers are small and clustered, often resembling miniature orchids. It relies on specific symbiotic fungi for nutrient uptake, a common trait among epiphytic orchids. Due to its fragile habitat and limited distribution, Racinaea aeris-incola is considered endangered and is often difficult to study in the wild."
