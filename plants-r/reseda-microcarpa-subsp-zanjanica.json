    "intro": "Reseda microcarpa subsp. zanjanica, commonly known as Zanjan redweed, is a perennial herb native to the Iranian plateau. It features slender, erect stems that are often branched and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in loose racemes, typical of the Resedaceae family. Its leaves are linear to lanceolate, with a slightly rough texture, and it thrives in dry, rocky soils. Zanjan redweed is notable for its resilience in arid environments and is often found in steppe and semi-desert regions."
