It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or black in color. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. This variety is closely related to other raspberries but is distinguished by its habitat and foliage structure."
