    "intro": "Rubus vitifolius, commonly known as the grape-leaved blackberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves that resemble grape leaves, with three to five leaflets. The plant produces small, dark red berries that are edible and often used in jams and pies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and autumn coloration."
