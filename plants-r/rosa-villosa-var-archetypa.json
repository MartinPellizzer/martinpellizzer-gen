    "intro": "Rosa villosa var. archetypa, commonly known as the archetypal bristly rose, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It features thorny stems covered in a dense layer of grayish-white hairs, which give it its \"bristly\" appearance. The plant produces fragrant, pink to red flowers in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are compound, with five to seven leaflets that are oval and serrated. This variety is valued for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a range of soil conditions."
