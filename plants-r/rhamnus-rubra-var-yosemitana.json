    "intro": "Rhamnus rubra var. yosemitana, commonly known as the Yosemite buckthorn, is a shrub native to the Sierra Nevada mountains of California. It is characterized by its small, dark green leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by black, berry-like fruits that are an important food source for wildlife. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian habitats. This variety is distinguished from the typical Rhamnus rubra by its narrower leaves and more compact growth habit."
