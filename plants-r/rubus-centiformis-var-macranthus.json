    "intro": "Rubus centiformis var. macranthus, commonly known as the large-flowered blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its robust growth habit and thorny stems, which are typical of the Rubus genus. The plant produces large, showy white to pink flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by dark purple to black berries in the fall. Its leaves are compound, consisting of three to five leaflets, and are covered in fine hairs. This variant is valued for both its ornamental appeal and its edible fruits, which are often used in jams and desserts."
