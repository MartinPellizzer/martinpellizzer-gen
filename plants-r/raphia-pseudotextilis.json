    "intro": "Raphia pseudotextilis, commonly known as the African fan palm, is a large, tropical plant native to Central and West Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, fan-shaped leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in long, pendulous clusters, which are pollinated by insects and birds. Its fruit is a fibrous, spiky capsule that contains edible seeds. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and has traditional uses in local communities for thatching and basket weaving."
