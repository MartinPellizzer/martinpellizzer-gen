    "intro": "Rodgersia pinnata, commonly known as the broadleaf rodgersia, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant produces showy, pinkish-white to lavender-colored flowers in late summer, which are borne on tall, slender stems. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained, moist soil, making it a popular choice for shaded garden landscapes. Rodgersia pinnata is valued for its ornamental foliage and long-lasting blooms, which add visual interest to gardens throughout the growing season."
