    "intro": "Rhododendron subarcticum, commonly known as the Arctic rhododendron, is a deciduous shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America and Eurasia. It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cold, high-altitude environments. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, pink to white flowers in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are dark green, leathery, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss in harsh climates. Rhododendron subarcticum plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for arctic wildlife."
