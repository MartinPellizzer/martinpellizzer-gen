It is characterized by its thorny stems and alternate leaf arrangement, with leaves that are typically three-lobed. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits known as drupes, which are usually red or black when mature. It thrives in moist, woodland habitats and is often found in the understory of forests. Its botanical features make it an important species for local wildlife, particularly birds and small mammals."
