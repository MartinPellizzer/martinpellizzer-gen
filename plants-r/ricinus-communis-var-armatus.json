    "intro": "Ricinus communis var. armatus, commonly known as the armed castor bean, is a variant of the castor oil plant characterized by its distinctive spiny seed pods. This plant is native to tropical regions and thrives in warm, humid climates. The leaves are large, palmate, and often have a rough texture, while the stems are hairy and robust. The spines on the seed pods serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. It is important to note that all parts of this plant contain toxic compounds, making it potentially hazardous to humans and animals."
