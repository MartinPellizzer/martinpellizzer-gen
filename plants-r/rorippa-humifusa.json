    "intro": "Rorippa humifusa, commonly known as the yellow water-cress, is a small, flowering plant native to moist environments in North America. It is characterized by its basal rosette of glossy, dark green leaves and small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in wet meadows, stream banks, and other damp habitats, where it thrives in partial to full sun. Its leaves are edible and have a peppery flavor, making it a traditional ingredient in some culinary uses. The species is also valued for its role in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support aquatic ecosystems."
