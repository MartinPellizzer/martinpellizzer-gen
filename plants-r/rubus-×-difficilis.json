    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 difficilis, commonly known as the thimbleberry, is a hybrid species within the Rubus genus, characterized by its small, thimble-shaped fruits. It is native to North America and thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and streambanks. The plant produces compound leaves with serrated edges and has a woody structure with thorny stems. Its flowers are typically white or pink, and the berries are edible, though they are often tart and less commonly consumed than other Rubus species. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators and wildlife."
