    "intro": "Rhus quartiniana, commonly known as the smooth sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically arranged in pairs along the stem, and its clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in the spring. The plant produces red, fuzzy berries that are a food source for various birds and wildlife. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in dry, open woodlands or along roadsides. Rhus quartiniana is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate poor soil conditions."
