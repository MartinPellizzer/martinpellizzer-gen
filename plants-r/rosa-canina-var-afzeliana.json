    "intro": "Rosa canina var. afzeliana, commonly known as the Afzelius rose, is a variant of the dog rose, characterized by its thorny stems and fragrant, pink to white flowers. It is native to parts of Europe and western Asia, often found in woodland edges and scrublands. The plant produces red, hairy fruits called hips, which are rich in vitamin C and used in traditional medicine. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with serrated edges, and the flowers typically bloom in late spring to early summer. This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological importance in supporting wildlife."
