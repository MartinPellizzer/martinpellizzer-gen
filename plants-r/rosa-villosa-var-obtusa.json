It is characterized by its densely hairy stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces fragrant, pink to red flowers in the spring, which are typically borne on long, slender peduncles. Its foliage is dark green and leathery, with serrated margins. Rosa villosa var. obtusa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and hardy nature in USDA hardiness zones 5 through 8."
