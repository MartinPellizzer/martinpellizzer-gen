    "intro": "Ribes cereum var. cereum, commonly known as wax currant, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters and is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and alternate, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during late spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for both humans and wildlife. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological restoration and a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
