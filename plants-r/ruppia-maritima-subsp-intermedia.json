    "intro": "Ruppia maritima subsp. intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate sea rocket, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments. It typically grows in brackish water and intertidal zones, where it thrives in coastal regions. The plant has small, scale-like leaves and produces tiny, greenish flowers that are pollinated by wind. Its roots are specialized to tolerate high salinity and fluctuating water levels. This subspecies plays an important role in stabilizing coastal sediments and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
