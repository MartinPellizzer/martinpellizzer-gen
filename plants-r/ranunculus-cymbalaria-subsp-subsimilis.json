    "intro": "Ranunculus cymbalaria subsp. subsimilis, commonly known as the water crowfoot, is a aquatic or semiaquatic flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, with its bright yellow flowers emerging from the water's surface. The plant has finely divided, arrow-shaped leaves that help it float and absorb sunlight. Its flowers are usually borne on long, slender stems and bloom in early spring. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
