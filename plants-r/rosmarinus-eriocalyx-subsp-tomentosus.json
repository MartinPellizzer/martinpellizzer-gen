    "intro": "Rosmarinus eriocalyx subsp. tomentosus, commonly known as the woolly rosemary, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its aromatic, needle-like leaves covered in a fine, woolly coating, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, pale blue or white flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and Mediterranean-style landscapes. Its essential oils, rich in compounds like camphor and pinene, are valued in both culinary and aromatic applications."
