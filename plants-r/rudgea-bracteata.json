    "intro": "Rudgea bracteata, commonly known as the velvetleaf or Brazilian velvetleaf, is a tropical shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its large, velvety leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming during the wet season. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that split open to release seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Rudgea bracteata is often found in disturbed habitats and is sometimes considered an invasive species in regions outside its native range."
