It is characterized by its thorny stems and small, fragrant pink or white flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant produces oval, red-orange fruits called hips, which are edible and often used in traditional medicine. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a slightly serrated edge. This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and visual appeal."
