    "intro": "Rhynchanthera limosa var. depauperata, commonly known as the slender marsh orchid, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in South America. It is characterized by its delicate, grass-like leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its reproductive strategy involves insect pollination, and it plays a role in supporting local biodiversity. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
