    "intro": "Ranunculus naguensis, commonly known as the Naga mountain buttercup, is a flowering plant native to the Himalayan regions of India and Nepal. It is characterized by its delicate, cup-shaped flowers that typically range in color from yellow to orange. The plant grows in alpine meadows and rocky habitats at high altitudes, often in areas with cool, moist climates. Its leaves are palmately divided and covered with fine hairs, while its stems are usually hairy and upright. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens despite its preference for wild, mountainous environments."
