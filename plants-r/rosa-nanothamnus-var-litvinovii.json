    "intro": "Rosa nanothamnus var. litvinovii, commonly known as the Litvinov's dwarf rose, is a rare and compact shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, dark green leaves with a slightly hairy texture, and its stems are covered in fine, reddish-brown hairs. It thrives in well-drained, alkaline soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a delicate and endangered species."
