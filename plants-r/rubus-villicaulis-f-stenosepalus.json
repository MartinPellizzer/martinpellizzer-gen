    "intro": "Rubus villicaulis f. stenosepalus, commonly known as the narrow-sepal raspberry, is a botanical variant of the raspberry plant characterized by its distinctive floral morphology. It features narrow, elongated sepals that distinguish it from the typical form of *Rubus villicaulis*. The plant is a deciduous shrub with compound leaves and produces small, aggregate fruits known as drupes. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland or shrubland habitats. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique floral characteristics and potential ecological role."
