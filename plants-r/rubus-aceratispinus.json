It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that turn red when mature, often used in jams and preserves. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and thickets. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
