    "intro": "Ranunculus afzelii, commonly known as the Kashmiri buttercup, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its showy, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and yellow. The plant typically grows in moist, alpine environments and has finely divided, trifoliate leaves. Its flowers bloom in spring and are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
