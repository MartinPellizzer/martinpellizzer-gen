It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its thorny stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, dark purple berries that ripen in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
