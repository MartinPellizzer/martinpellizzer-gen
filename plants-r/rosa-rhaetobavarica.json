    "intro": "Rosa rhaetobavarica, commonly known as the Rhaetian rose, is a rare and ancient species of flowering plant native to the Alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its simple, thornless stems and clusters of fragrant, pink to white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, elliptical leaves with a slightly serrated edge, and its flowers are typically borne on long pedicels. Rosa rhaetobavarica is noted for its hardiness and ability to thrive in high-altitude environments with cool temperatures and well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions."
