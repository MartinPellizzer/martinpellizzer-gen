    "intro": "Ranunculus fernandezii, commonly known as the Fernandez's buttercup, is a flowering plant native to South America, specifically Chile and Argentina. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family, which includes many showy, often toxic species. The plant features delicate, palmately divided leaves and bright yellow petals that resemble those of other buttercup species. It typically grows in moist, temperate environments such as forest floors or stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
