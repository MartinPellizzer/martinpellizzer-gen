    "intro": "Rubus foliosus subsp. saltuum, commonly known as the salt marsh rose. This subspecies is a shrub native to coastal areas, particularly in the British Isles and parts of northern Europe. It is characterized by its dense, thorny growth and small, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring. The leaves are typically trifoliate, with a serrated edge, and the plant thrives in moist, saline soils. It plays an important role in stabilizing coastal habitats and providing food for local wildlife."
