    "intro": "Rhinanthus vulgaris, commonly known as the common yellow rattle, is an annual flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom from June to August, typically in dry grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, branching stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, contributing to the biodiversity of its habitat. Rhinanthus vulgaris plays a role in stabilizing soil and promoting the growth of other plant species in its ecosystem."
