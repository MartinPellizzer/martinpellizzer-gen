    "intro": "Rubus bollae, commonly known as the Boll's blackberry, is a species of brambles native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and aggregate fruits, which are typically dark purple to black in color. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by the development of its edible berries in late summer. Rubus bollae thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, loamy conditions. It is often found in hedgerows, woodland edges, and disturbed sites, contributing to local biodiversity."
