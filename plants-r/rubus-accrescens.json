    "intro": "Rubus accrescens, commonly known as creeping raspberry, is a species of brambles native to North America. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features compound leaves with serrated edges and produces small, aggregate fruits known as drupes. Its flowers are white and clustered in groups of five to seven, and it has thorny stems that help in its identification. Rubus accrescens is often found in the eastern and central United States, where it plays a role in local ecosystems."
