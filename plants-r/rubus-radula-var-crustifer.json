It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, hairy leaves. The plant produces tiny, aggregate fruits that are typically red when mature. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study."
