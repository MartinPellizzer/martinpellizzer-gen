    "intro": "Rosa pomifera f. setulifera, commonly known as the hairy-fruited rose, is a unique botanical variant characterized by its distinctive, hairy fruits. This form of Rosa pomifera is notable for its large, fleshy, red or orange berries that resemble small apples, a feature that sets it apart from typical roses. The plant typically grows as a shrub with arching stems and compound leaves, often found in temperate regions. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been cultivated for its unusual fruiting habit. The hairy texture of its fruits is due to fine, glandular hairs that cover the surface."
