    "intro": "Regelia, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Gesneriaceae. It consists of about 15 species, most of which are native to South America, particularly Brazil. These plants are characterized by their striking, showy flowers that often resemble miniature orchids. Regelia species are typically grown as houseplants due to their preference for warm, humid environments. Their foliage is often velvety and dark green, adding to their ornamental appeal."
