It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, often clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
