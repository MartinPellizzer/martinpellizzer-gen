    "intro": "Rosa alpina var. glabrata, commonly known as the alpine rose, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink to white. The plant features smooth, glabrous stems and leaves with a slightly hairy texture. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine landscapes."
