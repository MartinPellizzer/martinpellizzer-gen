    "intro": "Rhododendron pogonostylum, commonly known as the woolly rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia, particularly in countries like Myanmar, Thailand, and Vietnam. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, often at elevations between 1,000 and 2,500 meters. Its leaves are leathery and evergreen, providing year-round coverage, while its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer. Rhododendron pogonostylum is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its role in local ecosystems."
