    "intro": "Rosa nudiflora, commonly known as the winter-flowering rose, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its simple, often hairy stems and pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and red, which bloom in late winter or early spring before the leaves appear. Rosa nudiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in gardens for its early blooming habit. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy addition to temperate climates."
