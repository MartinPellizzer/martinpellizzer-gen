    "intro": "Rubus hebecarpos f. apricus, commonly known as the yellow raspberry, is a botanical variant of the raspberry plant characterized by its distinctive yellow or orange fruits. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is native to parts of Asia, particularly China. The plant typically grows as a shrub with thorny stems and pinnately compound leaves. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, and the fruits develop from the flowering stems, ripening in late summer. This form is notable for its unique fruit color, which sets it apart from the more common red-fruited raspberries."
