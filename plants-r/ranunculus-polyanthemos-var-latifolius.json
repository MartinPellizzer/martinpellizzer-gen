    "intro": "Ranunculus polyanthemos var. latifolius, commonly known as the broadleaf buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features showy, yellow flowers with numerous petals and a central cluster of stamens, typical of the Ranunculaceae family. The leaves are palmately divided, with broad, lobed segments that are often hairy. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. This variety is distinguished by its wider foliage compared to the typical form of R. polyanthemos."
