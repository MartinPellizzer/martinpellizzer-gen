    "intro": "Rumex obtusifolius subsp. subulatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved dock, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features upright, branching stems that are often reddish in color, and its leaves are lanceolate to narrowly elliptic, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in dense clusters during late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, wastelands, and along roadsides. The leaves and stems are sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine for their astringent properties."
