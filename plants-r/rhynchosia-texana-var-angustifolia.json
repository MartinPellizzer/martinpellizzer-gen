    "intro": "Rhynchosia texana var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf cowpea, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, angular stems and trifoliate leaves composed of three elliptic to lanceolate leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by elongated, cylindrical pods containing several seeds. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. This species is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
