    "intro": "Ribes scabrum, commonly known as rough gooseberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters and is characterized by its rough, hairy stems and oval, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by berries that ripen to a bright orange-red color in late summer. Its berries are edible, though they are generally tart and often used in jams and preserves. Ribes scabrum is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
