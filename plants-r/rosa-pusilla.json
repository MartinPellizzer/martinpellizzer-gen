    "intro": "Rosa pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf garden rose, is a compact shrub native to Europe and western Asia. It features small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink, white, and red, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has dark green, serrated leaves and a dense, bushy growth habit that makes it ideal for rock gardens or borders. It is relatively low maintenance and thrives in well-drained soil with partial to full sunlight. Rosa pusilla is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
