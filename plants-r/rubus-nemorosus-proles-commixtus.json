It is a deciduous shrub that produces aggregate fruits, which are composed of small, drupe-like units called achenes. The plant has thorny stems and trifoliate leaves, with the leaves often having a serrated margin. Its flowers are typically white or pale green, and the fruits ripen to a dark purple or black color. This plant is valued for its edible berries and is often found in hedgerows and woodland edges."
