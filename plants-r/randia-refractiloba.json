    "intro": "Randia refractiloba, commonly known as the glassy randia, is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is native to tropical regions of South America. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters in height, characterized by its slender, often branched stems. The leaves are opposite, elliptical, and have a smooth, waxy surface that contributes to its common name. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers are clustered in cymes, and the plant produces small, round berries that are typically yellow or orange when mature. Randia refractiloba is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance."
