    "intro": "Rubus fruticosus f. nitidus, commonly known as the glossy blackberry, is a variant of the bramble plant characterized by its smooth, shiny leaves and dark purple berries. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is native to Europe and parts of Asia. The plant typically grows in shrub form, with thorny stems and clusters of small white flowers that bloom in early summer. Its berries are edible, though they are often used in jams and preserves due to their tart flavor. The glossy appearance of its leaves and fruits distinguishes this form from other Rubus species."
