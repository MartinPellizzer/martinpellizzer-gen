    "intro": "Ranunculus munroanus, commonly known as Munro's buttercup, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family, characterized by its showy, usually yellow or white flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils and cool climates. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three deeply lobed leaflets, and it produces small, aggregate fruits that disperse its seeds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
