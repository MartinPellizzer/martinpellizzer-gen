    "intro": "Ranunculus parviflorus var. dimidiatus, commonly known as the dwarf buttercup, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features delicate, hairy stems that bear trifoliate leaves with serrated margins. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland soils. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in some areas."
