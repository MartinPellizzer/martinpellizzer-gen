    "intro": "Rottboellia pilosa, commonly known as hairy rottbollias, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features slender, cylindrical stems that grow from a rhizomatous base, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a hairy texture, giving it its common name. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are often clustered in dense, cylindrical formations. Rottboellia pilosa is adapted to well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats."
