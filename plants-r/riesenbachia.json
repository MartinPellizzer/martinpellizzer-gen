    "intro": "Riesenbachia, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to South America. It features large, broad leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter, floating on the water's surface. The plant has showy, pale yellow or white flowers that bloom in the early morning. Its roots are submerged, anchoring it in the muddy bottom of still water bodies. Riesenbachia plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and shelter for various aquatic organisms."
