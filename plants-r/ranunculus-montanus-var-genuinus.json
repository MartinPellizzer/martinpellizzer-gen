It features showy yellow flowers with 5 to 15 petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has finely divided, trifoliate leaves that are alternate along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its botanical significance lies in its adaptation to high-altitude environments and its role in local ecosystems."
