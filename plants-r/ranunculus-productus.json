    "intro": "Ranunculus productus, commonly known as the creeping buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features a low-growing, mat-forming habit with numerous small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has a robust root system and spreads via rhizomes, making it an effective colonizer of disturbed soils. Its leaves are typically divided into lobes and are covered in fine hairs, while its flowers have five petal-like sepals. Ranunculus productus is often found in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
