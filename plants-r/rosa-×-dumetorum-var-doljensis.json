    "intro": "Rosa \u00d7 dumetorum var. doljensis, commonly known as the Doljensk rose, is a compact shrub native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and dark green, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink to red, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. Its ornamental value is complemented by its hardiness and ability to withstand colder climates."
