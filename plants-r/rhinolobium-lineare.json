    "intro": "Rhinolobium lineare, commonly known as the linear lobe orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, linear leaves and delicate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in late spring. The plant grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth, where it thrives in partial shade. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, aiding in nutrient absorption. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens."
