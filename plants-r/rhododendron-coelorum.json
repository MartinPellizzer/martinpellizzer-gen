    "intro": "Rhododendron coelorum, commonly known as the Coelorum rhododendron, is a rare and striking member of the Ericaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and showy, tubular flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. Native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas, this plant thrives in cool, moist climates with well-drained acidic soils. Its growth habit is typically shrub-like, with multiple stems forming a compact, bushy structure. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
