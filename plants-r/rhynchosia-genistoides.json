It is a leguminous species, belonging to the Fabaceae family, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and yellow, pea-like flowers. The plant has a climbing habit, often using its twining stems to ascend supports, and it produces small, lens-shaped pods that contain several seeds. Rhynchosia genistoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
