    "intro": "Rubus droseraceus, commonly known as the dewy raspberry, is a rare and unique plant native to the high-altitude regions of New Zealand. It is a shrub that features small, hairy leaves and produces clusters of pinkish-white flowers. The plant is notable for its ability to thrive in moist, cool environments, often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its fruit, resembling a raspberry, is edible and has a tart flavor. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
