    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus subsp. aurosulus, commonly known as the golden shield buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers with a broad, shield-shaped petal that gives it its common name. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with finely divided, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its flowers bloom in early to mid-summer, producing showy clusters of five petals that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The subspecies is adapted to rocky and alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun exposure."
