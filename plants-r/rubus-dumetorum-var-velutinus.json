It is characterized by its dark purple to black berries, which are typically small and have a slightly tart flavor. The plant produces compound leaves with serrated edges and thorny stems, typical of the Rubus genus. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks. The berries are used in jams and desserts, though they are less commonly cultivated than other blackberry varieties."
