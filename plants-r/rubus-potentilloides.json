    "intro": "Rubus potentilloides, commonly known as the slender blackberry, is a species of bramble native to North America. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, dark purple fruits that are typically not as flavorful as other blackberry varieties. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and thickets. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
