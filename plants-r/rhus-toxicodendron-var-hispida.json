    "intro": "Rhus toxicodendron var. hispida, commonly known as staghorn sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its rough, ridged, and hairy stems, which give it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by red, fuzzy berries that attract birds and other wildlife. Its leaves are alternate, compound, and have a serrated edge, contributing to its ornamental value. The species is also known for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its resilience to drought."
