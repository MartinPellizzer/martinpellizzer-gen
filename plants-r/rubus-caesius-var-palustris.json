It is a shrub that typically grows in moist, acidic soils, often found in bogs, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. The plant produces small, dark red berries that are edible but have a tart flavor. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and its stems are covered in thorns. This species plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing food for various wildlife species."
