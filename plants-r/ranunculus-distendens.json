    "intro": "Ranunculus distendens, commonly known as the broadleaf buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the western United States. It features delicate, palmate leaves with a hairy underside and produces showy, yellow flowers with five to eight petals. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks. It is characterized by its short, stout stems and its ability to spread through rhizomes. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
