It is a member of the Annonaceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and fragrant, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces a fruit that is similar in appearance to a soursop but is generally smaller and has a more hairy exterior. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. The fruit is edible, though its flavor is often described as bland or slightly bitter."
