    "intro": "Rhododendron campylogynum var. myrtilloides, commonly known as the dwarf blue rhododendron, is a compact evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of China. It features dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from deep purple to blue, depending on soil pH. The plant has leathery, dark green leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stems. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to bloom reliably in late spring to early summer."
