    "intro": "Rubus caesius f. praecurrens, commonly known as the early blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to Europe. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, dark red to black berries. The plant typically grows in woodland areas and along hedgerows, preferring well-drained soil. It blooms with white flowers in the spring, followed by the development of its edible fruits in late summer. This form is notable for its early fruiting habit compared to other Rubus species."
