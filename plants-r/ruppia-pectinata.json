    "intro": "Ruppia pectinata, commonly known as sea onion, is a halophytic plant adapted to thrive in saline environments such as coastal marshes and brackish waters. It is an aquatic plant with submerged leaves that are often ribbon-like in shape. The plant produces small, white flowers that are typically found in clusters near the water surface. Its roots form dense mats that help stabilize sediments and provide habitat for aquatic organisms. Ruppia pectinata plays an important role in coastal ecosystems by filtering water and supporting biodiversity."
