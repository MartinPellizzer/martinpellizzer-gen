    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 costei, commonly known as the hybrid blackberry or loganberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is a natural hybrid between Rubus ursinus (blackberry) and Rubus pectoralis (raspberry), resulting in a plant with unique botanical characteristics. The plant produces large, dark purple to black berries that are typically larger and sweeter than those of its parent species. Its leaves are compound, with three to five leaflets, and it has thorny stems typical of the Rubus genus. The plant thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its edible fruits."
