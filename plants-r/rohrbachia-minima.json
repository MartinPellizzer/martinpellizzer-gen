    "intro": "Rohrbachia minima, commonly known as the miniature rohrbachia, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, intricately patterned flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it relies on mycorrhizal associations for nutrient uptake. Its botanical features include slender stems, narrow leaves, and a unique floral structure that aids in pollination by specific insect species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Rohrbachia minima is considered a conservation concern."
