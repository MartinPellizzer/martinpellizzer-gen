    "intro": "Roegneria antiqua, commonly known as the ancient wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences, which bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks. Roegneria antiqua is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping or as a forage plant."
