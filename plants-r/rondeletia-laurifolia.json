    "intro": "Rondeletia laurifolia, commonly known as the golden flame or flame flower, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its striking, bright orange to red tubular flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and butterflies. The plant has simple, opposite, and often hairy leaves that are elliptical to ovate in shape. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for tropical and subtropical gardens. Its ornamental value lies in its vibrant flowers and evergreen foliage, which provide visual interest throughout the year."
