    "intro": "Rompelia nikoensis, commonly known as the Niko's flamebush, is a flowering plant native to the island of Nikos in the South Pacific. It is characterized by its vibrant orange-red flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. The plant has small, narrow leaves that are arranged alternately along the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, often growing in coastal or rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution, Rompelia nikoensis is considered a rare and endemic species."
