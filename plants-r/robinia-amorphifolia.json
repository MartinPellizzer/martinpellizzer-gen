    "intro": "Robinia amorphifolia, commonly known as the winged pod tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 10 to 20 cm long and have a distinctive, feathery appearance. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white flowers in the spring, followed by elongated, woody pods that remain on the tree throughout the winter. Its root system is extensive and can form dense colonies, making it a hardy and adaptable species. The plant is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, which enriches the soil and supports other plant growth."
