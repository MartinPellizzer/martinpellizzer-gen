    "intro": "Rhus radicans var. vulgaris, commonly known as staghorn sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and have serrated margins. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers followed by red, fuzzy berries that attract birds and other wildlife. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in disturbed soils along roadsides and in open woodlands. The bark of staghorn sumac is rough and fissured, giving it a distinctive appearance."
