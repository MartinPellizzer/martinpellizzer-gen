    "intro": "Rubus rowleei, commonly known as the Rowlee\u2019s blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is characterized by its thorny stems, compound leaves, and aggregate fruits that develop from multiple ovaria. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its flowers are usually white or pink, and they bloom in the spring. The fruit, which is edible, is often used in jams and desserts, though it is less common than other blackberry varieties."
