    "intro": "Rebutia robustispina var. minor, commonly known as the miniature spiny euphorbia, is a compact, succulent perennial native to arid regions of Central America. It features dense clusters of pale green, fleshy stems covered in small, spiny tubercles. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers during the summer months, adding a subtle ornamental touch. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, typical of many euphorbias. Due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
