    "intro": "Ranunculus obtusidens, commonly known as the broad-leaf buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features palmately divided leaves with a waxy, glossy surface and bright yellow flowers with numerous petals. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It is characterized by its toxic sap, which contains protoanemonin, and its ability to thrive in temperate climates. Ranunculus obtusidens plays a role in supporting pollinators and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value."
