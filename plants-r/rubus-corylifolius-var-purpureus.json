    "intro": "Rubus corylifolius var. purpureus, commonly known as the purple leaf bramble, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that often display a striking purple or reddish hue, especially during the growing season. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, hairy berries in the fall. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
