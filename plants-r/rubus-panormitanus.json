It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native range."
