    "intro": "Rodriguezia decora var. lactea, commonly known as the white-veined rodriguezia, is a striking tropical plant native to the Caribbean. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves with prominent white veins that contrast vividly with its dark green foliage. The plant produces showy, clustered inflorescences of small, white to pale pink flowers, which bloom throughout the growing season. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
