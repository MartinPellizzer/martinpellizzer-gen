    "intro": "Rousseauxia, commonly known as the sacred lotus of India, is a genus of aquatic and semi-aquatic plants belonging to the family Nymphaeaceae. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that bloom above the water surface, often in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant has broad, floating leaves that help in photosynthesis and provide habitat for aquatic life. Its roots are submerged, anchoring the plant in wetlands, ponds, and slow-moving rivers. Rousseauxia plays an important ecological role in water ecosystems and is also culturally significant in many Asian traditions."
