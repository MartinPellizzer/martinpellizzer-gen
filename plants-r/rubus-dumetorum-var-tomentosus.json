    "intro": "Rubus dumetorum var. tomentosus, commonly known as the woolly blackberry, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and thorny stems, which help it thrive in harsh, high-altitude environments. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black in color. Its leaves are ovate to elliptical in shape, with serrated margins and a velvety, grayish underside. This variant is closely related to other Rubus species but is distinguished by its unique pubescent appearance and ecological adaptations."
