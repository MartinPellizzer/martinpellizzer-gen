    "intro": "Rosa vosagiaca var. bargensis, commonly known as the Bargena rose, is a rare and ornamental shrub native to the Carpathian region. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and dark green, leathery leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant pink flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable species for botanical conservation."
