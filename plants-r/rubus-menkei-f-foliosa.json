    "intro": "Rubus menkei f. foliosa, commonly known as the broad-leaved blackberry, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its large, serrated leaves and clusters of small, dark red berries. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments and is valued for its ornamental foliage. Its leaves are broader than those of the typical Rubus menkei, giving it a distinctive appearance. The fruit, while edible, is less commonly cultivated compared to other blackberry species."
