    "intro": "Randia armata subsp. armata, commonly known as the scarlet snakeroot, is a shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves with a rough texture and its clusters of small, bright red flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant produces small, oval berries that are typically orange to red in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and disturbed habitats. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
