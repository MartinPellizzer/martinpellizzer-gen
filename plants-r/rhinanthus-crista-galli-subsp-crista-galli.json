    "intro": "Rhinanthus crista-galli subsp. crista-galli, commonly known as the common bird's-beak, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, elongated, yellow-orange flowers that resemble a bird's beak. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially depends on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and woodland clearings. Its flowering period occurs from June to August, and it plays a role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
