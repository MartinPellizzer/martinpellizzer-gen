    "intro": "Rosa glauca subsp. vicinalis, commonly known as the alpine rose, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has greyish-green foliage, which helps it retain moisture in its alpine habitat. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often growing in rocky or scree environments. Rosa glauca subsp. vicinalis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to withstand harsh climatic conditions."
