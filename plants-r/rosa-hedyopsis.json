    "intro": "Rosa hedyopsis, commonly known as the \"butterfly rose,\" is a species of flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink and are often adorned with a distinctive yellow center. The plant produces small, oval leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. Rosa hedyopsis is a deciduous shrub that thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact size and long blooming period, which can extend from late spring to early autumn."
