    "intro": "Rauvolfia affinis, commonly known as Indian snakeroot, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Americas. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its climbing habit, with tendrils that help it ascend supports. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers and is known for its medicinal properties, particularly due to the presence of reserpine. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and have a rough texture, while its roots are the primary part used in traditional medicine. Rauvolfia affinis thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forests or along riverbanks."
