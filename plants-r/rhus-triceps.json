    "intro": "Rhus triceps, commonly known as staghorn sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are arranged in a distinctive three-fingered pattern. The plant produces bright red, fuzzy fruits that persist through winter, providing food for wildlife. Its bark is thick and rugged, giving it a staghorn appearance. Rhus triceps thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in woodland edges and open fields."
