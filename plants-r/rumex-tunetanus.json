    "intro": "Rumex tunetanus, commonly known as the Tunisian sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features a basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves that are typically reddish or purplish in color. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are borne on slender, erect stems. Its leaves are edible and have a tangy, sour flavor due to the presence of oxalic acid. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments."
