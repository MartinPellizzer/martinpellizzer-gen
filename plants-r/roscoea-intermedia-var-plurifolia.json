    "intro": "Roscoea intermedia var. plurifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved roscoea, is a striking ornamental plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 cm in length, providing a lush, tropical appearance. The plant produces showy, red-orange inflorescences that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and prefers well-drained, humus-rich soil. Due to its aesthetic appeal and unique foliage, it is a popular choice for shaded garden beds and woodland landscapes."
