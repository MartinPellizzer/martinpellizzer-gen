    "intro": "Rubus colemannii var. adustus, commonly known as the desert raspberry, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its thorny stems and small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or yellow when mature. The plant has trifoliate leaves with serrated edges and produces white to pale pink flowers in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to high temperatures and low precipitation. Its botanical features make it well-suited for xeriscaping and ecological restoration in dry environments."
