    "intro": "Renealmia alpinia, commonly known as the alpine renealmia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the family Bromeliaceae, which includes many tropical and subtropical plants. The plant is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that can store water, a feature adapted to its arid or high-altitude habitat. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, often in a spike, and come in various colors such as red, orange, and yellow. Renealmia alpinia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-draining soil and full sun."
