    "intro": "Rhytidophyllum stipulare, commonly known as the leafy spurge, is a perennial plant belonging to the Euphorbiaceae family. It is characterized by its opposite, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by specialized structures called cyathia. It is native to temperate regions of Asia and is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils. Due to its invasive nature, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural settings."
