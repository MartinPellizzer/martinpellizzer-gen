    "intro": "Rosa spuria var. subsenticosa, commonly known as the rough-stemmed wild rose, is a perennial shrub native to arctic and alpine regions of Eurasia. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, fragrant white or pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are alternate, simple, and covered with fine, glandular hairs, giving them a slightly sticky texture. The plant produces aggregate fruits called rosehips, which are reddish-orange and contain numerous seeds. It is adapted to cold climates and is often found growing in rocky or sandy soils."
