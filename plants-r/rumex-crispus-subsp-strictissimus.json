    "intro": "Rumex crispus subsp. strictissimus, commonly known as curly dock, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North America. It is characterized by its wavy, toothed leaves that are often covered in a whitish, powdery coating called a bloom. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are typically borne on slender, erect stems. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in fields, along roadsides, and near water bodies. Its leaves and roots have been used historically in traditional medicine and as a vegetable."
