    "intro": "Rhus amherstensis, commonly known as the Amherst smooth sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically pinnately arranged with 11 to 31 leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by red, fuzzy berries that are an important food source for birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woods, along streambanks, and in disturbed areas. Rhus amherstensis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone regions."
