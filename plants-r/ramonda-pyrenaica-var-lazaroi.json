It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at elevations ranging from 1,000 to 2,500 meters. The plant features basal rosettes of narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers in late spring. Its flowers are clustered in umbels, and the plant is characterized by its compact growth habit and drought tolerance. It is often found in open habitats such as meadows and slopes, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade."
