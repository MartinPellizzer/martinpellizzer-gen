    "intro": "Rosa virginiana subsp. lucida, commonly known as the shining dogwood rose, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves with serrated edges and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant produces red-orange hips in the fall, which are edible and serve as a food source for wildlife. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands and streambanks. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological importance in native habitats."
