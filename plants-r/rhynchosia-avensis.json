    "intro": "Rhynchosia avensis, commonly known as the Amazonian burr legume, is a climbing legume native to tropical regions of South America. It features compound leaves with stipules and produces small, yellow flowers that are followed by distinctive, spiny pods. The plant is characterized by its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. Rhynchosia avensis is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and shrublands. Its seeds are encased in thick, woody pods that can persist on the plant for extended periods."
