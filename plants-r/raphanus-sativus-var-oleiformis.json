    "intro": "Raphanus sativus var. oleiformis, commonly known as black radish, is a variety of the radish plant characterized by its dark purple to black skin and elongated, cylindrical root. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes other cruciferous vegetables like broccoli and cabbage. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are typically arranged in clusters, and its leaves are edible, though often less palatable than those of other radish varieties. The root is the primary part harvested for culinary use, offering a sharp, peppery flavor. It is cultivated in temperate climates and is valued for its unique taste and nutritional content."
