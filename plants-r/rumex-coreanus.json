    "intro": "Rumex coreanus, commonly known as Korean sorrel, is a perennial herb native to East Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves that are often reddish or purplish at the base, with a sour taste due to its high oxalic acid content. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its leaves are used in traditional Korean cuisine and herbal medicine."
