    "intro": "Ruta broussonetiana, commonly known as mountain rue, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features narrow, gray-green leaves with a distinctive aromatic scent. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by spherical, dark blue berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its historical use in herbal medicine is attributed to its purported antispasmodic and digestive properties."
