    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 evanidus, commonly known as the ghost raspberry, is a hybrid species within the Rubus genus. It is characterized by its delicate, biennial growth habit and produces small, red berries that are often short-lived. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and streambanks. Its leaves are trifoliate, with a serrated margin, and it has thorny stems that are often covered in fine hairs. Due to its ephemeral nature and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and elusive plant in its native range."
