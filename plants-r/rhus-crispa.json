    "intro": "Rhus crispa, commonly known as the smooth sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and have a distinctive, slightly serrated edge. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by clusters of red, fuzzy fruits that ripen in the fall. Rhus crispa thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in woodland edges, thickets, and disturbed soils. Its botanical features make it a valuable species for ecological studies and native landscaping."
