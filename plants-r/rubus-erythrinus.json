    "intro": "Rubus erythrinus, commonly known as the scarlet raspberry, is a species of bramble native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that turn bright red when ripe, often clustered together. Its flowers are white with five petals and are typically found in the axils of the leaves. Rubus erythrinus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant berries and structural interest."
