    "intro": "Rubus viridulus, commonly known as green bramble, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is a shrub that typically grows in moist, disturbed soils across Europe and parts of Asia. The plant is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and clusters of white flowers that bloom in the summer. Its fruits, known as blackberries, are edible but often have a bitter taste due to the presence of anthocyanins. Rubus viridulus plays a role in supporting local wildlife, including birds and insects, by providing food and shelter."
