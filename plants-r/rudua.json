It features small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that are typically clustered in a single head. The plant has slender, branching stems and hairy leaves that are often covered in fine white hairs. Rudua is native to Europe and is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in meadows. It plays a role in supporting pollinators and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
