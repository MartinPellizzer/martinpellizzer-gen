    "intro": "Rodigia bulgarica, commonly known as the Bulgarian rodigia, is a rare flowering plant native to the Balkan Peninsula. It belongs to the family Boraginaceae and is characterized by its hairy stems and distinctive blue-violet flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in sunny, well-drained environments. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a rough texture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Rodigia bulgarica is considered a species of conservation concern."
