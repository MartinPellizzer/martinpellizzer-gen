    "intro": "Rhamnus littoralis, commonly known as the coastal buckthorn, is a shrub or small tree native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, thorny branches and small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in spring, followed by black, fleshy berries that are an important food source for birds. It thrives in salty, coastal environments and is often found in dunes or along cliffs. Due to its hardy nature, it plays a significant role in stabilizing coastal soils and preventing erosion."
