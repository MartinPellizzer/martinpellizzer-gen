    "intro": "Rhamnus escalerae, commonly known as the Escalera buckthorn, is a shrub native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its dense, thorny growth habit and small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, followed by black, berry-like fruits that are a food source for various birds and mammals. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
