    "intro": "Rorippa microphylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved watercress, is a small, aquatic or semi-aquatic flowering plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in shallow water, wetlands, and along the edges of ponds and streams. The plant has tiny, alternate leaves that are usually less than 1 cm in length, and it produces small, white or yellowish flowers. It is often found in disturbed or nutrient-rich waters, and it can spread rapidly through both seeds and vegetative reproduction. Rorippa microphylla is an important species in aquatic ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and small vertebrates."
