    "intro": "Rubus ardens, commonly known as the fiery raspberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Rosaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like roses and strawberries. The plant is characterized by its thorny stems, pinnately compound leaves, and clusters of red-orange berries that ripen in late summer. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, with five petals and numerous stamens. The berries are not only ornamental but also edible, though they are often more tart than those of common raspberries."
