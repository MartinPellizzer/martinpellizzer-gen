    "intro": "Rumex \u00d7 corconticus, commonly known as the hybrid sorrel, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Rumex acetosa (common sorrel) and Rumex acetobipinus (broadleaf sorrel). It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically reddish or purple-veined. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are borne on tall, slender stems. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. The leaves are edible but contain oxalic acid, which can be toxic in large quantities."
