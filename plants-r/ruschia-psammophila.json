    "intro": "Ruschia psammophila, commonly known as the sandruschia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, rounded shape and dense clusters of small, fleshy leaves. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its drought tolerance, it is well-suited for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
