    "intro": "Rhododendron \u00d7 russelianum, commonly known as the Russian rhododendron, is a hybrid evergreen shrub native to the Caucasus region. It features dense, leathery foliage with deep green leaves that provide a striking backdrop for its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The blooms, which range from pink to red, are typically borne in clusters and are highly fragrant. This plant thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to form compact, bushy growth that adds texture and color to shaded landscapes."
