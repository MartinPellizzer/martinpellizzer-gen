    "intro": "Rhipsalis saxicola, commonly known as the rock candelabra cactus, is a unique epiphytic cactus native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It features a branching, shrub-like structure with slender, cylindrical stems that often grow in a cascading or bushy form. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom during the rainy season, adding a delicate floral display to its appearance. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments with good air circulation. Rhipsalis saxicola is popular as a houseplant due to its low maintenance and attractive, trailing growth habit."
