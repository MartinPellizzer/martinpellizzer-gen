    "intro": "Rorippa palustris var. dissecta, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water crowfoot, is a aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to temperate regions. It typically grows in shallow water, along the edges of ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. The plant features finely dissected, fern-like leaves that float on the water surface or extend underwater. Its small, white flowers appear in clusters and bloom from late spring to early summer. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various water organisms."
