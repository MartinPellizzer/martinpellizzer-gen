It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and clusters of small, fragrant pink or white flowers. The plant produces oval, leathery leaves with a distinctive bract-like structure at the base of each flower cluster. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to gardens in temperate climates. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and long-lasting blooms."
