    "intro": "Ricinocarpus zeyheri, commonly known as the Natal mangrove, is a small evergreen tree native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in saline environments. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers followed by woody capsules containing numerous seeds. It plays a crucial role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species. Its ability to tolerate saltwater makes it an important component of mangrove ecosystems."
