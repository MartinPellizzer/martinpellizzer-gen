    "intro": "Rhus oblongifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically pinnately arranged with elongated, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by red, fuzzy berries that are a food source for birds and other wildlife. Rhus oblongifolia thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and stream banks. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscape use in suitable climates."
