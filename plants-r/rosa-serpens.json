It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant has slender, wiry stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. Its leaves are pinnately compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets. Rosa serpens is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
