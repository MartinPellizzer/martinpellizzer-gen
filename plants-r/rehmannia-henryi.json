    "intro": "Rehmannia henryi, commonly known as Henry's rehmannia, is a perennial herb native to China, particularly found in the mountainous regions of Yunnan and Sichuan. It belongs to the family Scrophulariaceae and is characterized by its hairy stems and opposite leaves that are often lance-shaped. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming in late summer. It is valued in traditional Chinese medicine for its purported health benefits, including kidney support and blood circulation. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
