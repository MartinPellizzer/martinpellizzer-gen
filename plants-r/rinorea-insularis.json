    "intro": "Rinorea insularis, commonly known as the island rinorea, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Pacific Islands. It typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to saline and wind-swept environments. The plant has simple, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. Its flowers are small, white, and clustered in dense inflorescences, which attract various pollinators. Rinorea insularis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in its native habitat."
