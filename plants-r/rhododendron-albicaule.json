    "intro": "Rhododendron albicaule, commonly known as the white-stemmed rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and showy, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in shady, moist environments, often in forest understories where it thrives in cool, humid climates. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, providing a striking contrast to its delicate floral displays. Rhododendron albicaule is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with appropriate soil and light conditions."
