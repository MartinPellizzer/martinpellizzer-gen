    "intro": "Ranunculus peruvianus, commonly known as the Peruvian buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the Andean regions of South America. It features showy, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from white to yellow and sometimes pink, with a hairy, segmented structure. The plant has finely divided, trifoliate leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens but is also threatened by habitat loss in the wild."
