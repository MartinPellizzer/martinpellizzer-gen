    "intro": "Rhynchospora ponapensis, commonly known as the Ponap\u00e9 sedge, is a flowering plant native to the island of Ponap\u00e9 in the Federated States of Micronesia. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems. The plant typically grows in wetland or marshy habitats, thriving in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are clustered in spikelets, a common feature among sedges. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Rhynchospora ponapensis is considered a rare and endemic species."
