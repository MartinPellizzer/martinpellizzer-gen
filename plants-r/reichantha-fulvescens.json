It belongs to the family Porellaceae and is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form. The plant has a distinctive yellowish-green coloration, which is most prominent on its reproductive structures. Reichantha fulvescens typically grows on rocks or soil in temperate regions, and it plays a role in soil stabilization and microhabitat creation. Its simple morphology and ecological significance make it an important species in bryophyte studies."
