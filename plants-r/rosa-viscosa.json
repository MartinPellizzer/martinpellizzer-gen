    "intro": "Rosa viscosa, commonly known as the woolly rose, is a species of flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, fuzzy grayish-white hairs covering its stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant pink or white flowers that bloom in the spring. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with serrated edges, and the fruit is a red, hairy rosehip that matures in the autumn. Rosa viscosa is often found in rocky or arid environments and is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in herbal medicine."
