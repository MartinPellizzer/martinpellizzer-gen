    "intro": "Ritchiea pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf cycad, is a unique member of the Cycadaceae family. It is a small, slow-growing plant native to the tropical rainforests of Queensland, Australia. The plant features a short, thick trunk and a crown of feathery, pine-like leaves. Its reproductive structures include a cone-like male strobilus and a female ovulate cone. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, Ritchiea pygmaea is considered an endangered species."
