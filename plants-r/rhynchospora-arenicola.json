    "intro": "Rhynchospora arenicola, commonly known as the sand reed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in dunes or along the edges of salt marshes. The plant features slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, white to pale blue flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, blooming during the summer months. Rhynchospora arenicola plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
