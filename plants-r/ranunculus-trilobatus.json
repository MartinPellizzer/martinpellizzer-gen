    "intro": "Ranunculus trilobatus, commonly known as the lesser celandine, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features bright yellow flowers with 5 to 8 petals, and its leaves are typically trifoliate, meaning they are divided into three parts. The plant grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides. Its flowers bloom in early spring, and it produces small, green berries that contain seeds. Ranunculus trilobatus is often found in damp soils and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
