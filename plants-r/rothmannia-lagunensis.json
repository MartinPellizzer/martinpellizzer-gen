    "intro": "Rothmannia lagunensis, commonly known as the coastal rothmannia, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, adapted to withstand salt spray and arid conditions. Rothmannia lagunensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes."
