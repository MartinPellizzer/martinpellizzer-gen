It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves with prominent veins and a distinctive, elongated, ribbed fruit cluster. The plant typically grows in shallow water or along the edges of ponds and streams. Its leaves are often submerged or floating, adapting to aquatic environments. It plays a role in stabilizing water bodies and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
