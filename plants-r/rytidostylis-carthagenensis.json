    "intro": "Rytidostylis carthagenensis, commonly known as the Carthage grass, is a perennial grass native to parts of Africa and the Middle East. It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as sandy soils and along roadsides. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain minute, wind-dispersed seeds. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in ecological restoration projects in arid and semi-arid regions."
