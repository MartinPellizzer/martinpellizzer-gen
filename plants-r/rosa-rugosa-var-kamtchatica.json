    "intro": "Rosa rugosa var. kamtchatica, commonly known as the Kamchatka rose, is a hardy shrub native to the coastal regions of Russia. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and oval, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hair. The plant produces fragrant, pink to red flowers in late spring to early summer, which are followed by large, fuzzy, orange-red hips. It is well adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and harsh weather conditions. This variety is popular in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in challenging climates."
