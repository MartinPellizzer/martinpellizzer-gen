    "intro": "Rindera lanata var. pumila, commonly known as the woolly rindera, is a low-growing, perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that covers the stems and leaves, providing a protective layer against desiccation. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pale yellow or greenish in color, adapted to attract specific pollinators. Its root system is fibrous and extensive, allowing it to thrive in poor soil conditions and withstand periods of drought. This species is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of fiber in local communities."
