    "intro": "Riedlea urticifolia, commonly known as the stinging nettle tree, is a tropical plant native to regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are covered in fine hairs that can cause skin irritation upon contact. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, and its fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule. Riedlea urticifolia is often found in moist, shaded areas such as forests and along riverbanks. It has been used in traditional medicine for various purposes, though its botanical properties remain understudied."
