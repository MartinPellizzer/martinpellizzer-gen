It produces pink to red blooms in early summer, which are often followed by orange-red hips. The plant has small, leathery leaves with serrated edges, typical of many rose species. It is well-suited for growing in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a hardy choice for gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its resilience and ability to thrive in various climates."
