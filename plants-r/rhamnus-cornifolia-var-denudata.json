    "intro": "Rhamnus cornifolia var. denudata, commonly known as the smoothleaf buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and alternate, oval to elliptic leaves that are typically smooth and glossy. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters during early spring, followed by orange to red berries that are an important food source for birds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks. Its botanical features make it a distinctive member of the Rhamnaceae family."
