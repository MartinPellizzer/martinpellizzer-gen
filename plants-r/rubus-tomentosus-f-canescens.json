It is characterized by its dense, white-tomentose (fuzzy) pubescence on both the stems and leaves, which gives it a silvery appearance. The leaves are typically trifoliate, with serrated margins and a leathery texture. The flowers are small, white to pale pink, and appear in clusters, followed by red, aggregate fruits. This subspecies is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats, showcasing adaptability to various environmental conditions."
