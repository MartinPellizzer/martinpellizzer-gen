    "intro": "Rubus microcarpus, commonly known as the small-fruited blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically less than 1 centimeter in diameter. These berries are often overlooked due to their modest size but are edible and have a tart flavor. Botanically, Rubus microcarpus is part of the Rubus genus, which includes many other brambles and blackberries."
