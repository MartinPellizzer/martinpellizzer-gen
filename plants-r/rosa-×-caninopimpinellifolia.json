    "intro": "Rosa \u00d7 caninopimpinellifolia, commonly known as the dog rose or wolf rose, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Rosa canina and Rosa pimpinellifolia. It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of fragrant, pink or white flowers. The plant produces rose hips, which are the fruit containing the seeds, and these hips are often used in herbal remedies. It thrives in temperate climates and is commonly found in woodland edges and hedgerows. The botanical features of this plant make it both ornamental and ecologically valuable."
