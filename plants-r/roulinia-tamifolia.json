It belongs to the family Bignoniaceae and is characterized by its striking yellow-orange tubular flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has opposite, simple, and ovate leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, aiding in its dispersal.
