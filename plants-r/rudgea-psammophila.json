    "intro": "Rudgea psammophila, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, often blooming in late summer. The plant has hairy, narrow leaves that help reduce water loss in its dry habitat. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low precipitation. Rudgea psammophila plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing nectar for pollinators in its native environment."
