    "intro": "Ramonia, commonly known as sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple ray flowers and spiny, leaf-like bracts that surround the central disk. Ramonia species are typically found in coastal areas, thriving in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. The plant's structure includes alternate, narrow leaves and a compact growth habit that helps it withstand salty sea breezes. It plays an important role in coastal ecosystems by stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for various small organisms."
