    "intro": "Rubus quadraticus, commonly known as the broad-leaf blackberry, is a species of bramble native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive quadrangular stems and large, lobed leaves. The plant produces aggregate fruits composed of small, dark purple to black achenes. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodlands and along hedgerows. Due to its robust growth, it can become invasive in certain regions if not managed properly."
