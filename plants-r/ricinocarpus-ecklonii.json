    "intro": "Ricinocarpus ecklonii, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and palmate leaves that are typically 10\u201320 cm in diameter. The plant produces small, white flowers arranged in panicles, followed by yellowish-orange fruits that contain toxic seeds. It is often found in coastal and inland forested areas, thriving in well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value and the presence of toxic compounds, it requires careful handling."
