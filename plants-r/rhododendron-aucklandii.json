    "intro": "Rhododendron aucklandii, commonly known as the Auckland rhododendron, is a species native to New Zealand. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows in coastal areas and is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves. The plant produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to purple, which bloom in spring. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal scrub and forest margins. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
