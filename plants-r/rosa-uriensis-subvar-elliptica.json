    "intro": "Rosa uriensis subvar. elliptica, commonly known as the elliptic swamp rose, is a perennial shrub native to wetland habitats in North America. It features elongated, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy on the underside. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, pink to red flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found near streams or in marshy areas. Due to its adaptability to wet conditions, it plays an important role in stabilizing shoreline ecosystems."
