    "intro": "Ranunculus cuneifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaf buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the western United States. It features delicate, nodding flowers with five to eight white petals and a yellow center, typical of the Ranunculaceae family. The plant has finely divided, serrated leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, aiding in water retention. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Its blooming period occurs in early to mid-summer, adding a striking visual element to its habitat."
