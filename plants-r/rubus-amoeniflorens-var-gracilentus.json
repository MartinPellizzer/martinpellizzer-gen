    "intro": "Rubus amoeniflorens var. gracilentus, commonly known as the graceful evergreen blackberry, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and dark green, leathery leaves that remain throughout the year. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically black when mature, though they may retain a reddish hue in some varieties. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial shade, making it suitable for cultivation in temperate climates. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is sometimes grown in gardens and for local consumption."
