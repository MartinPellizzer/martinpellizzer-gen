    "intro": "Ranunculus silvaticus subsp. mixtus, commonly known as the mixed wood anemone, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe. It typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and along stream banks. The plant features delicate, palmately divided leaves and showy, yellow flowers with five petals. It blooms in early spring, often before the canopy of the forest is fully leafed out. This subspecies is characterized by its variability in leaf shape and flower size, contributing to its common name."
