    "intro": "Reichardia grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered watercress, is a flowering plant native to the wetlands and stream banks of eastern North America. It is characterized by its basal rosette of succulent, glossy, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Reichardia grandiflora is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes other cruciferous plants. It is often found in moist, nutrient-rich soils and can spread through both seeds and vegetative reproduction."
