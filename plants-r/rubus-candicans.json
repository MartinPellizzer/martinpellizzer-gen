    "intro": "Rubus candicans, commonly known as the silverleaf raspberry, is a species of bramble native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its hairy, silver-green leaves and small, edible red berries that ripen in the fall. The plant typically grows in moist, wooded areas and thrives in partial to full shade. Its flowers are white and clustered, producing a mild, aromatic scent. The fruit is often used in jams and desserts, though it is less commonly cultivated than other raspberry varieties."
