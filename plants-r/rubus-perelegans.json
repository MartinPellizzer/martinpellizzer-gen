    "intro": "Rubus perelegans, commonly known as the alpine raspberry, is a species of bramble native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and the production of small, edible berries that ripen in late summer. The plant features compound leaves with serrated edges and produces white to pale pink flowers in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
