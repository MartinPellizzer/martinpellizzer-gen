    "intro": "Rosa collettii, commonly known as the Collett's rose, is a species native to the high altitudes of South America, particularly in Argentina and Chile. It is a shrub-like plant that typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in cool and moist conditions. The plant produces fragrant, pink to white flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are dark green, glossy, and arranged alternately along the stems. Rosa collettii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with suitable growing conditions."
