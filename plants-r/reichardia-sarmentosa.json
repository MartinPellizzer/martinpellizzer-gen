    "intro": "Reichardia sarmentosa, commonly known as the creeping reichardia, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Reichardia sarmentosa is often found in disturbed soils and can spread rapidly through runners, making it both a common and sometimes invasive species in certain habitats."
