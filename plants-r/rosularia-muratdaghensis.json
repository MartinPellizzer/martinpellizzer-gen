    "intro": "Rosularia muratdaghensis, commonly known as the Muratdagh rosebush, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Turkey. It belongs to the family Rosaceae and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. Rosularia muratdaghensis is adapted to rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows."
