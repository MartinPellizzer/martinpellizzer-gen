    "intro": "Rubus hirtus var. chamaebaetus, commonly known as the creeping blackberry, is a low-growing shrub native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces edible berries that are typically dark purple to black in color, often used in jams and desserts. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It is often found in woodland edges and along stream banks, where it forms dense ground cover."
