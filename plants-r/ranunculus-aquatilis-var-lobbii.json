    "intro": "Ranunculus aquatilis var. lobbii, commonly known as the aquatic buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in Europe. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, with its slender stems and broad, floating leaves adapted to aquatic conditions. The plant produces yellow flowers with five petals, which are often accompanied by numerous stamens. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator of water quality."
