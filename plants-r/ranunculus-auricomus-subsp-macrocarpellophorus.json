    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus subsp. macrocarpellophorus, commonly known as the large-sepaled buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It features bright yellow flowers with five broadly ovate petals, often with a distinctive greenish or reddish base. The plant typically grows to a height of 20\u201360 cm, with hairy stems and trifoliate or palmately compound leaves. Its flowers bloom from late spring to early summer, and the subspecies is distinguished by its larger, more prominent sepals compared to the typical species. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges."
