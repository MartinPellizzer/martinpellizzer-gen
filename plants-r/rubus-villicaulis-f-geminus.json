    "intro": "Rubus villicaulis f. geminus, commonly known as the twin-fruited blackberry, is a botanical variant of the blackberry plant characterized by its unique fruit morphology. This form exhibits twin fruits that develop from a single flower, a phenomenon known as gemination. The plant is native to certain regions of North America and is often found in moist, wooded areas. Its leaves are compound, with three to five leaflets, and the stems are covered in fine, silvery hairs. The fruit, while small, is prized for its tart flavor and is sometimes used in local culinary traditions."
