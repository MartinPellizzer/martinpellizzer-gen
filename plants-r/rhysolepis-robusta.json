    "intro": "Rhysolepis robusta, commonly known as the robust lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Lecanoraceae. It is characterized by its crustose growth form, forming a thin, flat layer on rock surfaces, typically in shaded, moist environments. The thallus is lecanorine, with a distinct upper cortex and a medulla composed of loosely aggregated hyphae. It is often found on calcareous substrates, such as limestone, in temperate regions. This lichen is an important indicator species for environmental conditions and is used in ecological studies to assess air quality."
