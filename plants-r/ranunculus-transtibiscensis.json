    "intro": "Ranunculus transtibiscensis, commonly known as the Trans-Tibetan buttercup, is a species of flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family, which includes many showy, often toxic plants. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky areas, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its flowers are usually bright yellow or white, with five petals and numerous stamens, giving it a delicate, daisy-like appearance. Due to its limited distribution and fragile habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
