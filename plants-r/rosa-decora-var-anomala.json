    "intro": "Rosa decora var. anomala, commonly known as the Alaska rose, is a rare and striking variant of the Rosa decora species. It is native to the high elevations of Alaska and is characterized by its large, showy pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a shrub-like growth habit with thorny stems and dark green, leathery foliage. Its botanical features include compound leaves with five to seven leaflets and a strong, pleasant fragrance. Due to its limited natural range and specific environmental requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
