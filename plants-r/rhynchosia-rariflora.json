It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are often used in traditional agriculture. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three leaflets that are typically hairy and oval in shape. Rhynchosia rariflora is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it an important plant in sustainable farming practices."
