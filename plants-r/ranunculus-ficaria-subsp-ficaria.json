    "intro": "Ranunculus ficaria subsp. ficaria, commonly known as the lesser celandine, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread readily, making it both a common wildflower and a potential weed in garden settings."
