    "intro": "Roegneria carinata, commonly known as the awned wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Asia and North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, cylindrical stems that often bear awns on the lemma. The plant produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences with two to three bract-like glumes. Its leaves are narrow, flat, and covered with fine hairs, and it typically grows in moist, well-drained soils. Roegneria carinata is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
