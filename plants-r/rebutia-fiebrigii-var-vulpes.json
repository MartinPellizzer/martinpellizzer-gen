    "intro": "Rebutia fiebrigii var. vulpes, commonly known as the \"Red Fox Cactus,\" is a compact, low-growing cactus native to Mexico. It features a rounded stem with prominent, ribbed segments that are typically green with red or purple markings. The plant produces clusters of small, vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its compact size and ornamental flowers, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting."
