    "intro": "Rhododendron chrysanthum var. niko-montanum, commonly known as the Niko-Montanum rhododendron, is a compact evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It features dense, leathery foliage with deep green leaves that provide a striking contrast to its showy flowers. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink, white, and red, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and long-lasting blooms."
