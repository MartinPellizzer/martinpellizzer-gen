It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Rondeletia sericea and Rondeletia flava, both native to South America. The plant is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that typically range in color from yellow to orange, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. The leaves are usually opposite, simple, and have a slightly hairy texture, contributing to its ornamental value in gardens."
