The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by red, fuzzy berries that are a striking feature of the species. Its foliage is often covered in a fine, velvety pubescence, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant is adapted to moist, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade."
