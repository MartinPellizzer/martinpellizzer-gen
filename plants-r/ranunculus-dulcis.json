    "intro": "Ranunculus dulcis, commonly known as the sweet coltsfoot, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It features a basal rosette of heart-shaped, hairy leaves and produces showy yellow or orange flowers with five petals. The plant is characterized by its milky sap, which contains various alkaloids and can be irritating to the skin. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. The flowers bloom in early spring, making it one of the earliest flowering plants in temperate regions."
