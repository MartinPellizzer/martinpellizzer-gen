    "intro": "Rosa pomifera var. coerulescens, commonly known as the blue rose, is a rare and ornamental variant of the rose family. It is characterized by its striking blue-pink flowers, which are a result of high levels of delphinidin, a type of anthocyanin pigment. The plant typically grows as a shrub with thorny stems and dark green foliage. It thrives in temperate climates and requires well-drained soil and full sun for optimal growth. Due to its unique coloration, it is highly sought after in horticulture and botanical gardens."
