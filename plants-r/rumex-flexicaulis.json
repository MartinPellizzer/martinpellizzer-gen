    "intro": "Rumex flexicaulis, commonly known as broadleaf dock, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a robust, upright stem that can grow up to 1 meter in height, often branching near the top. The leaves are broad, lance-shaped, and have a waxy surface with a distinct midrib, often appearing dark green. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters at the ends of the stems, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant is characterized by its fibrous roots and is often found in moist, disturbed soils such as roadsides and fields."
