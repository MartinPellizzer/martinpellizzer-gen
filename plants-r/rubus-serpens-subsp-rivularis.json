    "intro": "Rubus serpens subsp. rivularis, commonly known as the river raspberry, is a shrub native to the wetlands and stream banks of eastern North America. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and trifoliate leaves, which are usually covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or yellow when ripe, attracting various pollinators and wildlife. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in riparian zones. Due to its ecological importance, it is sometimes considered a keystone species in its native habitat."
