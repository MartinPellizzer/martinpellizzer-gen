    "intro": "Rumex \u00d7 zsakii, commonly known as the hybrid sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Polygonaceae family. It is a natural hybrid between Rumex acetosa (common sorrel) and Rumex acetobulus (broadleaf sorrel), resulting in a plant with distinctive foliage. The leaves are typically heart-shaped, with a reddish or purple tinge on the veins, and they have a sour taste due to the presence of oxalic acid. It is often found in moist, disturbed soils in temperate regions. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by triangular, winged seeds."
