    "intro": "Ruellia viscosa, commonly known as sticky ruellia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves that produce a sticky substance, which gives the plant its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically blue or purple in color. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and along stream banks. Ruellia viscosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and blooms."
