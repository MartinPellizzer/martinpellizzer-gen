    "intro": "Rosa trachyphylla var. arvatica, commonly known as the roughleaf rose, is a variant of the roughleaf rose species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its thick, glandular, and often hairy foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of pink to red, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its stems are woody and often thorny, typical of many rose species. This variety is often found in woodland edges and moist soils, thriving in partial to full sun."
