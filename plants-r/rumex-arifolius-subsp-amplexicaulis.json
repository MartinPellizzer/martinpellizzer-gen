    "intro": "Rumex arifolius subsp. amplexicaulis, commonly known as the broad-leaf sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its distinctive broad, heart-shaped leaves that often wrap around the stem. It belongs to the Polygonaceae family and is native to parts of Europe and western Asia. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are edible and have a tangy, sour flavor due to the presence of oxalic acid. This subspecies is often found in moist, calcareous soils in woodland or grassland habitats."
