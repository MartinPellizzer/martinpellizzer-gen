    "intro": "Rubus substrictus, commonly known as the narrowleaf blackberry, is a species of brambles native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, thorny stems and small, dark berries that ripen in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are alternate, with serrated edges and a hairy texture. Botanically, it is closely related to other Rubus species, sharing similar morphological traits but distinguished by its narrow leaf shape."
