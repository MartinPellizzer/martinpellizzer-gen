    "intro": "Rhus occidentalis, commonly known as poison oak, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It belongs to the Anacardiaceae family and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets arranged in a cluster. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by red or orange berries that are attractive to birds. Its leaves contain urushiol, a toxic oil that can cause severe skin irritation in humans. Poison oak is often found in woodland areas and thrives in partial to full sunlight."
