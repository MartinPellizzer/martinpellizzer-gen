    "intro": "Rosa \u00d7 salaevensis var. bernetii, commonly known as the Bernet's Rosa, is a hybrid rose species native to the Caucasus region. It is characterized by its vigorous growth and thorned stems, which are typical of many rose species. The plant produces large, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white, often with a subtle scent. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets, and it is relatively drought-tolerant once established. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its beauty and hardiness."
