It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many economically important plants such as coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves and small, white flowers that bloom in clusters.

Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a delicate species with limited distribution."
