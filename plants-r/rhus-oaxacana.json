    "intro": "Rhus oaxacana, commonly known as the Mexican sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Mexico and parts of the southern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically arranged in pairs along the stems. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by red, fuzzy fruits that contain several seeds. Rhus oaxacana is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. It has been used traditionally for its medicinal properties and as a source of tannins."
