    "intro": "Rumex acetosella var. subspathulatus, commonly known as narrow-leaved sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features slender, reddish stems and narrow, heart-shaped leaves with a smooth or slightly toothed margin. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its leaves are edible but contain oxalic acid, making them potentially harmful if consumed in large quantities."
