    "intro": "Rubus babingtonianus, commonly known as Babington's blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the western United States. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves, typical of the Rubus genus. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that ripen to a dark purple or black color. It thrives in moist, temperate climates and is often found in woodlands and along streambanks. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
