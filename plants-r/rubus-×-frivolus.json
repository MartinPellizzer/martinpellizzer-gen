    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 frivolus, commonly known as the wild blackberry, is a hybrid plant belonging to the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves, which are typical features of the Rubus genus. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that ripen to a dark purple or black color, often with a sweet-tart flavor. It thrives in temperate climates and is commonly found in woodland areas and along hedgerows. Due to its hardy nature, it is both a wild plant and a cultivated species in horticulture."
