    "intro": "Rumex \u00d7 schulzei, commonly known as the hybrid sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant that exhibits characteristics of its parent species, Rumex acetosa and Rumex acetogynus. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks, where it thrives in well-drained soils. The plant features broad, arrow-shaped leaves with a distinctive reddish coloration on the underside, and it produces small, clustered flowers in late spring. Its rhubarb-like leaves are edible but contain oxalic acid, making them suitable for culinary use in moderation. The hybrid is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological habitats."
