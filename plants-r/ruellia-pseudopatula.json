    "intro": "Ruellia pseudopatula, commonly known as the Mexican bluebell, is a flowering plant native to Central America and parts of the southern United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 feet, featuring lance-shaped leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces clusters of blue to purple tubular flowers that bloom in the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for gardeners seeking a vibrant, low-maintenance ornamental plant. Its rapid growth and ability to naturalize make it both a desirable and sometimes invasive species in certain regions."
