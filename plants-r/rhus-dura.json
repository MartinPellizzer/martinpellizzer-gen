    "intro": "Rhus dura, commonly known as the smooth sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically pinnately arranged with 11 to 31 leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in upright clusters, followed by red, fuzzy berries that are a common food source for birds. Rhus dura thrives in full sun to partial shade and is adaptable to a variety of soil types. Its ornamental value and ecological importance make it a popular plant in native landscaping."
