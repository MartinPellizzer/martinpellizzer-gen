    "intro": "Rorippa palustris subsp. hispida, commonly known as hispid water-cress, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its upright, branched stems and small, alternate leaves that are covered in fine, glandular hairs. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on slender pedicels. It thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, stream banks, and along the edges of ponds. Its rapid growth and ability to tolerate fluctuating water levels make it an important species in aquatic ecosystems."
