    "intro": "Rhododendron pachycarpon, commonly known as the broadleaf rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of East Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. It is characterized by its large, leathery leaves that are often broader than they are long, and its showy, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. The plant typically grows in acidic, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist climates with partial shade. It is a deciduous shrub that can reach heights of up to 3 meters, making it a striking addition to gardens and natural landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated for horticultural purposes."
