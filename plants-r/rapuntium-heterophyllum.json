    "intro": "Rapuntium heterophyllum, commonly known as the variable rapunculus, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its biennial life cycle, with the first year spent as a rosette of basal leaves and the second year producing a flowering stem. The plant features small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by the development of a fleshy, edible root. Its leaves are typically alternate and have a slightly hairy texture, while the stems are erect and often branched. Rapuntium heterophyllum is known for its adaptability to various soil types and its ability to thrive in disturbed environments."
