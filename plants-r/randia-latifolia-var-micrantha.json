    "intro": "Randia latifolia var. micrantha, commonly known as the narrow-leaved randia, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are typically narrower than those of the standard R. latifolia. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale pink, followed by spherical, red berries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in warm climates."
