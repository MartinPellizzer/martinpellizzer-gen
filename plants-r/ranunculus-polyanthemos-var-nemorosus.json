It features delicate, bright yellow flowers with numerous small petals, typically blooming in early spring. The plant has finely divided, trifoliate leaves that are often covered in a soft, downy layer. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a common sight in forest understories. Its botanical characteristics make it an attractive addition to native plant gardens and ecological restorations."
