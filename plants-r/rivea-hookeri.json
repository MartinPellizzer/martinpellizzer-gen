    "intro": "Rivea hookeri, commonly known as the silver vine, is a climbing plant native to South America. It features heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery hair, giving it its common name. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. It is known for its ability to climb using its tendrils, often found growing along fences or trees. The flowers give way to small, round berries that are edible but not widely consumed by humans."
