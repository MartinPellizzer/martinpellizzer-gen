    "intro": "Rubus enanthophorus, commonly known as the early bloom raspberry, is a species of bramble native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom early in the spring. The plant produces small, edible berries that are typically red or yellow when ripe. It thrives in moist, wooded areas and is often found in the understory of forests. Due to its limited range and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
