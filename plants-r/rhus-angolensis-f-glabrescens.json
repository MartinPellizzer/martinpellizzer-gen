It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous leaves that are typically elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in panicles, which are followed by clusters of red or orange berries. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions and full sun. The plant is often used in ornamental gardening due to its attractive foliage and seasonal berries."
