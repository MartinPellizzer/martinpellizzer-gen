    "intro": "Romeroa verticillata, commonly known as the mountain holly or false holly, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is a shrub that typically grows in rocky or open woodland habitats, often at higher elevations. The plant features small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and evergreen, with a slight waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Romeroa verticillata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and attractive foliage."
