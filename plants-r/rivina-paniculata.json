    "intro": "Rivina paniculata, commonly known as the redroot false nettle, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring opposite, ovate leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to red flowers in late spring to early summer, which are followed by small, round, red berries. These berries are edible for humans and birds but contain mild toxins, so caution is advised when consuming them. Rivina paniculata is often found in moist, wooded areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
