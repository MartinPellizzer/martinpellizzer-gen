    "intro": "Rosa dumalis f. fraxinoides, commonly known as the fraxinoid form of the alpine rose, is a botanical variant characterized by its unique leaf morphology. It features elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often more slender than those of the typical Rosa dumalis. This form thrives in alpine environments, where it adapts to cold, high-altitude conditions. The plant produces clusters of pink to white flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its botanical significance lies in its morphological distinctiveness and ecological adaptation to harsh mountainous regions."
