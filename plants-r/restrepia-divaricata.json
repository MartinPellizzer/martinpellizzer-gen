    "intro": "Restrepia divaricata, commonly known as the variable restrepia, is a species of orchid native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in humid, shaded environments at high elevations. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, supporting its growth in cooler climates. Its flowers are usually pale green to yellow, with a distinctive lip that is often darker in color. Restrepia divaricata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to cultivate under the right conditions."
