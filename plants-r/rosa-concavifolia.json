It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of fragrant, pink to red flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are compound, with deeply lobed, concave leaflets that give the plant its distinctive appearance. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. This perennial shrub is valued for both its ornamental beauty and its historical use in traditional medicine."
