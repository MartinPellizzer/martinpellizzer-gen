    "intro": "Ranunculus fascicularis var. deforesti, commonly known as the Deforest's buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to specific regions of North America. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features delicate, palmately divided leaves and bright yellow flowers with five petals. It is characterized by its hairy stems and is often found in association with other moisture-loving flora. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
