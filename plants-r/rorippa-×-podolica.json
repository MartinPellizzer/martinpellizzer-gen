    "intro": "Rorippa \u00d7 podolica, commonly known as the hybrid watercress, is a member of the Brassicaceae family and is characterized by its aquatic or semi-aquatic growth habit. It typically features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often submerged or floating, adapted to thrive in wetland environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which are pollinated by insects. Its seeds are small and contained in siliques, a common fruit type in the Brassicaceae family. Rorippa \u00d7 podolica is often found in ponds, ditches, and other shallow water habitats across temperate regions."
