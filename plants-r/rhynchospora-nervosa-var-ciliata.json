    "intro": "Rhynchospora nervosa var. ciliata, commonly known as the ciliated narrowleaf spikerush, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and other grass-like plants. The plant features slender, grass-like stems with narrow, linear leaves that have finely serrated margins. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, three-lobed flowers. This variety is characterized by its distinctive ciliate (fringed) hairs on the leaf margins, which aid in its identification."
