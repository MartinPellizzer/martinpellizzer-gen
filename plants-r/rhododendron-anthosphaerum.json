    "intro": "Rhododendron anthosphaerum, commonly known as the spherical flowered rhododendron, is a rare and distinctive species native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its unique, clustered inflorescence that resembles a spherical shape, giving it its common name. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are dark green, leathery, and arranged in a compact, evergreen habit. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in the wild."
