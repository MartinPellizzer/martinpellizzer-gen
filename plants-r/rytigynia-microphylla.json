    "intro": "Rytigynia microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved rytigynia, is a shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically arranged oppositely along the stems. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing minute seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
