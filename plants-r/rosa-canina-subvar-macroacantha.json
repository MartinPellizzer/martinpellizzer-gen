    "intro": "Rosa canina subvar. macroacantha, commonly known as the large-fruited dog rose, is a subspecies of the dog rose native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its larger, more robust rose hips compared to the typical Rosa canina, which are often red or orange in color when mature. The plant produces fragrant pink to white flowers in the spring, followed by the development of its showy, hairy fruits. It thrives in a variety of soils but prefers well-drained, sunny locations. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and has historical uses in herbal medicine."
