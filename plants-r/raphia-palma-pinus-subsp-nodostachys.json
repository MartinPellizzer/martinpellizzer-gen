    "intro": "Raphia palma-pinus subsp. nodostachys, commonly known as the nodostachys raffia palm, is a member of the Arecaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its large, pinnate leaves that can reach lengths of up to 10 meters, making it one of the tallest palm species. The plant produces long, feather-like inflorescences that bear small, clustered flowers, followed by fibrous, elongated fruits. Its trunk is typically covered with a fibrous outer layer and has a smooth, pale-green to grayish color. This species is valued for its fibrous material, which is used in traditional crafts and as a source of natural fiber."
