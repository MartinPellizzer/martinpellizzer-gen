    "intro": "Ruellia lacustris, commonly known as the lake ruellia, is a flowering plant native to the wetlands of Central and South America. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist or swampy environments. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Ruellia lacustris is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in waterlogged soils."
