    "intro": "Rosa scopoliana, commonly known as the Turkish rose, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces rose hips, which are rich in vitamin C and have been used in traditional medicine. Rosa scopoliana is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in perfumery. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth."
