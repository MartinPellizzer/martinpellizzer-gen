It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along riverbanks. Rhaponticum longifolium is also known for its medicinal properties, traditionally used in herbal remedies."
