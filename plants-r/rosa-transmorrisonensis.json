    "intro": "Rosa transmorrisonensis, commonly known as the Morrison's rose, is a rare and striking species native to the high altitudes of the Andes. It is characterized by its large, velvety pink petals and a strong, sweet fragrance that attracts pollinators. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, temperate climates. Its leaves are deeply lobed and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Rosa transmorrisonensis is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
