    "intro": "Rosa systyla f. surda, commonly known as the dark-stemmed rose, is a unique hybrid species within the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its dark, almost black stems and foliage, which distinguish it from other rosa species. The plant produces fragrant, semi-double pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is typically found in moist, shaded environments, such as woodlands or stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and rarity, it is often cultivated in specialized gardens and botanical collections."
