It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow flowers. The plant is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil through its root nodules, which host symbiotic bacteria. Its bark and leaves have been used traditionally by Indigenous Australians for various purposes, including dyeing and medicinal applications."
