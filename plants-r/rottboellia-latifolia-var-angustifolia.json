    "intro": "Rottboellia latifolia var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf carpet grass, is a variant of the carpet grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is a perennial grass characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves and dense, low-growing habit. The plant typically forms a mat-like growth, with small, spike-like inflorescences that produce numerous tiny grains. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and lawns. Its botanical features make it both a common weed and a potential ornamental plant in certain landscapes."
