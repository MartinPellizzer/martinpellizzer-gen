    "intro": "Rhododendron mucronulatum f. lucidum, commonly known as the glossy alpine azalea, is a compact shrub native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It features dark green, leathery leaves that are glossy and elliptical in shape. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to red, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often cultivated in cooler climates for its vibrant floral display."
