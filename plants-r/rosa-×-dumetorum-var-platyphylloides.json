    "intro": "Rosa \u00d7 dumetorum var. platyphylloides, commonly known as the flat-leaf shrub rose, is a compact, thorny shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, dark green leaves with a distinctive flat, broad shape, and produces fragrant, pale pink to white flowers. The plant is characterized by its dense growth habit and is often used in rock gardens or as a hedge due to its hardiness. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various garden conditions."
