    "intro": "Riedelia montana var. arfakensis, commonly known as the Arfak mountain riedelia, is a rare flowering plant native to the highlands of New Guinea. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants, and is characterized by its hairy stems and showy flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments at elevations above 1,500 meters. Its leaves are palmately lobed, and it produces small, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in clusters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
