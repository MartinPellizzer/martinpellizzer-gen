    "intro": "Relbunium hirtum subsp. genuinum, commonly known as the Alpine thimbleweed, is a member of the Asteraceae family and is native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, thriving in harsh, high-altitude environments. Its subspecies status reflects subtle morphological differences from the main species, particularly in the structure of its leaves and inflorescence. Relbunium hirtum subsp. genuinum is adapted to cold climates and has a limited geographic distribution."
