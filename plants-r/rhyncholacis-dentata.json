    "intro": "Rhyncholacis dentata, commonly known as the toothed bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves that are often notched or toothed, giving it its scientific name. The plant is a carnivorous species that traps small aquatic organisms using specialized bladder-like structures. These bladders are filled with water and can rapidly expel it to capture prey. Rhyncholacis dentata typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and ditches."
