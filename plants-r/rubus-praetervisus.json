It is characterized by its slender, thorny stems and small, dark purple to black fruits. The plant produces compound leaves with serrated edges and has a shrub-like growth habit. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and streambanks. The berries are edible but have a tart flavor, making them a valuable resource for both wildlife and humans."
