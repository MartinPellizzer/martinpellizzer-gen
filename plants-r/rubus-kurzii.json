    "intro": "Rubus kurzii, commonly known as the Kurz's bramble, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, including parts of China, Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan. The plant is characterized by its thorny stems, trifoliate leaves, and small, aggregate fruits that develop from its flowers. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and full sun exposure. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Rubus kurzii is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
