    "intro": "Rorippa nasturtium-aquaticum subsp. sterilis, commonly known as water cabbage or swamp cress, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to wetlands and slow-moving waters. It has alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating, with a waxy surface to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in nutrient-rich, shallow waters. This subspecies is often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of rivers."
