    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 assurgens var. pusillus, commonly known as the dwarf blackberry or small-fruited blackberry, is a hybrid shrub native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its thorny stems and dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically less than 1 cm in diameter. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated margins, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a source of edible, though small, berries."
