    "intro": "Raimannia humifusa, commonly known as the creeping raimannia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It typically forms dense mats of foliage, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often reddish in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or greenish flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments, often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil, making it a valuable plant for erosion control in wetland habitats."
