    "intro": "Rosa canina f. monticola, commonly known as the Alpine rosehip, is a subspecies of the dog rose native to mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and smaller, more densely packed flowers compared to the typical Rosa canina. The plant produces distinctive red or orange hips that are rich in vitamin C and often used in traditional medicine. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with serrated margins, and it thrives in well-drained, acidic soils. This subspecies is well adapted to harsh alpine environments, displaying resilience to cold and poor soil conditions."
