    "intro": "Rubus villicaulis subsp. lasiocaulon, commonly known as the woolly blackberry, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, woolly hairs covering the stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, dark red berries that are typically eaten by birds and other wildlife. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in chaparral and coastal scrub habitats. The subspecies is distinguished by its more robust growth and thicker foliage compared to other Rubus species."
