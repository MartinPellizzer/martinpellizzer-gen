    "intro": "Rubia glabra, commonly known as common madder, is a flowering plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is a herbaceous perennial that grows up to 60 cm tall, characterized by its slender stems and alternate leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its roots contain a red dye called alizarin, which has been historically used in the textile industry. Rubia glabra thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade."
