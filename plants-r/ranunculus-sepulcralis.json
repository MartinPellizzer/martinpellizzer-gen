It features delicate, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, often with a contrasting central blotch. The plant has trifoliate leaves that are deeply lobed and covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Due to its striking appearance and historical associations, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for ornamental purposes."
