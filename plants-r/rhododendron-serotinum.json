    "intro": "Rhododendron serotinum, commonly known as the late-blooming rhododendron, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It typically grows in acidic, well-drained soils and thrives in partial to full shade. The plant produces dense clusters of bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to purple, which bloom later in the season compared to other rhododendron species. Its leaves are leathery and elliptical, providing year-round interest in the garden. Rhododendron serotinum is valued for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in cooler, moist environments."
