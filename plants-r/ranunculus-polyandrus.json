    "intro": "Ranunculus polyandrus, commonly known as the many-stamen buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, yellow flowers with numerous stamens, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are palmately divided, and the flowers bloom from spring to early summer. Ranunculus polyandrus is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for its vibrant, daisy-like appearance."
