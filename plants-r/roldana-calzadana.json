    "intro": "Roldana calzadana, commonly known as the mountain lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It features upright, slender stems that bear clusters of white to pale pink flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a rosette at the base, providing a dense foliage layer. Its flowering stems are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. Roldana calzadana thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to alpine gardens."
