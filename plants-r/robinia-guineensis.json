    "intro": "Robinia guineensis, commonly known as the African locust tree, is a deciduous leguminous tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically pinnate with numerous small, oval-shaped leaflets. The tree produces yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in spring, followed by pod fruits containing edible seeds. It has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion and can thrive in a variety of soil types. The plant is also valued for its hard, heavy wood and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
