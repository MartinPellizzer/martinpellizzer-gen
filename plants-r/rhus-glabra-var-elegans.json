    "intro": "Rhus glabra var. elegans, commonly known as the velvetleaf sumac, is a variant of the smooth sumac native to the eastern United States. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically pinnately arranged with serrated margins. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by red, fuzzy fruits that are a common food source for birds. Its foliage turns a striking red in the fall, adding ornamental value to landscapes. The plant is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in open woodlands and disturbed areas."
