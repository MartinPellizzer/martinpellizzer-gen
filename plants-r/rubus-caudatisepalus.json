    "intro": "Rubus caudatisepalus, commonly known as the long-sepaled blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves with serrated edges and its thorny stems, typical of the Rubus genus. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that ripen to a dark purple or black color, similar to other blackberry varieties. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and thickets. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
