    "intro": "Rapanea coriifolia, commonly known as the glossy buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves that remain glossy throughout the growing season. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by orange-red berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its botanical features make it a valuable species for ecological studies and ornamental gardening."
