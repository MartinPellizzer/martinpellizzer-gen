    "intro": "Rhamnus biglandulosa, commonly known as the biglandular buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown stems and alternate, ovate leaves with prominent veins. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are followed by dark blue, fleshy berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and rocky areas. Rhamnus biglandulosa is notable for its ecological role in supporting local wildlife, particularly birds that feed on its berries."
