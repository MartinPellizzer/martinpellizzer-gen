    "intro": "Rhodognaphalopsis coriacea, commonly known as the woolly dwarf dandelion, is a low-growing perennial plant native to South America. It features a compact rosette of hairy, gray-green leaves that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that develop into fluffy, white seed heads, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in gardens."
