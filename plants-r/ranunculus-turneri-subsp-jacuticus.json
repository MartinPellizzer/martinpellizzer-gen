    "intro": "Ranunculus turneri subsp. jacuticus, commonly known as the Jacutian buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It features a basal rosette of deeply lobed, palmately arranged leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with five petal-like sepals and numerous stamens, typical of the Ranunculaceae family. It thrives in cold, dry environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
