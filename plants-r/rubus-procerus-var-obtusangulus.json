    "intro": "Rubus procerus var. obtusangulus, commonly known as the blunt-angled blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to certain regions of North America. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with rounded leaflets. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black in color. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in forest understories. Its botanical features make it distinct from other Rubus species, particularly in its leaf shape and fruit structure."
