    "intro": "Rhus linguata, commonly known as the smooth sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and have a distinctive, slightly serrated edge. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in upright clusters, followed by red, fuzzy berries that attract birds and other wildlife. Rhus linguata thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or open fields. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a common component of native plant communities."
