    "intro": "Rhexia inaequilateralis, commonly known as the unequal-leaf bluebell, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are elliptic to ovate in shape, with the base often broader than the tip, giving it its specific epithet \"inequilateralis.\" Rhexia inaequilateralis thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands and pine flatwoods."
