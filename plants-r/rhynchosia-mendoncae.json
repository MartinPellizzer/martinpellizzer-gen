It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes and beans, and is characterized by its distinctive pod-like fruits that enclose its seeds. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats and has small, compound leaves with a hairy texture. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, and it produces a unique, spiny structure that aids in seed dispersal."
