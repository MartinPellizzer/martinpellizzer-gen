    "intro": "Ranunculus cibiniensis, commonly known as the Balkan buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the Balkan Peninsula. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its bright yellow, cup-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and forest edges. Its leaves are palmately lobed, and it produces small, hairy fruits that disperse its seeds. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and protected species in some regions."
