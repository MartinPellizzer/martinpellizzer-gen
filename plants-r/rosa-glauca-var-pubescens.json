    "intro": "Rosa glauca var. pubescens, commonly known as the woolly meadow rose, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features slender, arching stems covered in a dense layer of white to pale gray hairs, giving it a distinctive fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink to white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and covered with a similar pubescent coating, contributing to its overall rugged appearance. This species is adapted to harsh, alpine environments and is often found in rocky soils and meadows."
