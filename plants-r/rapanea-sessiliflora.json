    "intro": "Rapanea sessiliflora, commonly known as the sessile-leaf holly, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Lauraceae, which includes other aromatic plants like laurel and cinnamon. The plant is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are typically sessile, meaning they lack a petiole and are directly attached to the stem. Its small, white flowers are clustered in axillary inflorescences, and it produces small, dark blue berries that are edible. Rapanea sessiliflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its dense foliage and year-round greenery."
