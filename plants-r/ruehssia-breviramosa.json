    "intro": "Ruehssia breviramosa, commonly known as the short-branched ruehssia, is a member of the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias. It is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya and Tanzania. The plant features small, opposite leaves that are often hairy and have a distinctive, somewhat aromatic scent. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, clustered in small inflorescences, and it produces small, round berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. Due to its ornamental value and unique foliage, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
