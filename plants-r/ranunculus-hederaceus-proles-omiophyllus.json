    "intro": "Ranunculus hederaceus proles omiophyllus, commonly known as the creeping buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features a low-growing, spreading habit with rhizomatous stems that allow it to colonize moist, shaded environments. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with five petal-like sepals, which are often mistaken for true petals. Its leaves are typically trifoliate, with three deeply lobed leaflets, and the plant is known for its rapid spread through vegetative reproduction. It thrives in wetlands, stream banks, and other damp habitats, making it an important species in ecological succession."
