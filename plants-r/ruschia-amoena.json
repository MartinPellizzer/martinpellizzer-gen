    "intro": "Ruschia amoena, commonly known as the pink stinkbush, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Aizoaceae family, commonly referred to as the ice plant family. The plant features succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white powder, which helps reduce water loss. Its showy, pink to purple flowers bloom in late winter to early spring, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Ruschia amoena is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping."
