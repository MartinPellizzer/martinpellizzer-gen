It is characterized by its distinctive red bark and large, palmate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the autumn. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in spring, followed by winged fruits that aid in seed dispersal. Its botanical features make it a popular ornamental plant in horticulture. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and requires partial to full sunlight for optimal growth."
