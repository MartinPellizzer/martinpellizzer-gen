    "intro": "Rikliella australiensis, commonly known as the Australian rikliella, is a rare flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is a small shrub that typically grows in sandy soils and is adapted to the harsh coastal environment. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are narrow and evergreen, providing a dense canopy that helps protect the soil from erosion. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
