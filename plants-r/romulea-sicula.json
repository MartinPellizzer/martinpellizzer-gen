    "intro": "Romulea sicula, commonly known as the Sicilian bulbous orchid, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Sicily. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its compact, bulb-like structure that stores nutrients for flowering. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange, typically blooming in spring. Its leaves are grass-like and basal, forming a rosette around the bulb. Romulea sicula is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils."
