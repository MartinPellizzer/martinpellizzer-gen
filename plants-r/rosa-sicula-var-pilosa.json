It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and showy pink to red flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows as a shrub with thorny stems and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. Its hairy leaves and stems provide a unique texture, distinguishing it from other rose varieties. It is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its ecological role in supporting pollinators."
