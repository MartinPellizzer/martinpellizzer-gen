    "intro": "Rosa canina f. barbatostylis, commonly known as the barbate-styled dog rose, is a botanical variant of the common dog rose. It is characterized by its distinctive, barbed stamens that give it its specific epithet. This subspecies is native to parts of Europe and is often found in woodland and scrub habitats. The plant produces fragrant pink to white flowers in spring, followed by red, hairy fruits known as hips. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in herbal medicine."
