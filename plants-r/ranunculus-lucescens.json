It features delicate, cup-shaped flowers with bright yellow petals and a central cluster of stamens. The plant typically grows in rocky or meadow habitats, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss. The species is noted for its early spring blooming habit, adding vibrant color to mountainous landscapes."
