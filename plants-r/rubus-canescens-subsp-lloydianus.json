    "intro": "Rubus canescens subsp. lloydianus, commonly known as the Lloyd's bramble, is a shrub native to the Appalachian region of the United States. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its prickly stems and clusters of white to pale pink flowers. The leaves are typically trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the plant produces small, edible berries that are often used in local foraging. It thrives in moist, wooded areas and is adapted to partial shade, making it a common sight in forest understories. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly larger leaves and more robust growth compared to other Rubus species."
