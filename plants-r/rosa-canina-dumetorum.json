It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces red, berry-like fruits called hips, which are rich in vitamin C and used in traditional medicine. Rosa canina dumetorum is native to Europe and western Asia and thrives in sunny, well-drained soils. It is often found in hedgerows, woodland edges, and disturbed habitats."
