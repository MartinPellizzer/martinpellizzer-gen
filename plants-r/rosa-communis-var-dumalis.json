    "intro": "Rosa communis var. dumalis, commonly known as the Dumal rose, is a rare and lesser-known cultivar of the rose family. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white. The plant is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and thrives in cooler climates. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and historical significance in traditional medicine. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
