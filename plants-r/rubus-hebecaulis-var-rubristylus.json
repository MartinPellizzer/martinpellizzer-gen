    "intro": "Rubus hebecaulis var. rubristylus, commonly known as the red-styled blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to certain regions of the United States. It is characterized by its distinctive red-colored styles on the flowers, which set it apart from other Rubus species. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically harvested in the fall. Its foliage consists of trifoliate leaves with serrated edges, and it thrives in well-drained soils. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and edible fruits, though it is less commonly cultivated than other blackberry types."
