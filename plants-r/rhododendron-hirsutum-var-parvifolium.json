    "intro": "Rhododendron hirsutum var. parvifolium, commonly known as the dwarf alpine rhododendron, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It features small, leathery leaves that are often hairy, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to red, typically blooming in late spring. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings."
