    "intro": "Rumex conglomeratus subsp. rupestris, commonly known as rock sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to rocky and alpine environments. It typically grows in dry, calcareous soils and is often found in mountainous regions. The plant features basal rosettes of lanceolate leaves with serrated margins and produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers. Its leaves are edible and have a tangy, sour flavor due to the presence of oxalic acid. It is well adapted to harsh conditions and is often used in traditional herbal medicine."
