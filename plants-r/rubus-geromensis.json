    "intro": "Rubus geromensis, commonly known as the Geromense bramble, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of South America, particularly in Argentina and Chile. The plant is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, white to pink flowers. Its leaves are typically trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it produces edible berries that are often used in local cuisine. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
