It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is native to parts of North America. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are usually compound, with serrated edges, and it produces small, aggregate fruits known as drupes. The white bramble is often found in association with other Rubus species, contributing to the ecological diversity of its habitat."
