    "intro": "Ranunculus \u00d7 subacri-bulbosus, commonly known as the hybrid meadow buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Ranunculaceae family. It is characterized by its showy, bright yellow or orange flowers with numerous petals and a central cluster of stamens. The plant typically grows in moist meadows and along streambanks, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are palmately divided, and it produces smooth, elongated seed pods that release seeds by wind. The hybrid nature of this plant results from crosses between different Ranunculus species, contributing to its variability in appearance."
