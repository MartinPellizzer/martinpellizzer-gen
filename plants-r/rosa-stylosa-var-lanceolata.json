    "intro": "Rosa stylosa var. lanceolata, commonly known as the lanceleaf evergreen rose, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It features lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are glossy and arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces fragrant, semi-double pink flowers with a white center, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its woody stems are covered in thorny prickles, and it is well adapted to coastal climates with mild winters and warm, dry summers. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in coastal gardens."
