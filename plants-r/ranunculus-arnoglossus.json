    "intro": "Ranunculus arnoglossus, commonly known as the alpine buttercup, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, bright yellow flowers with numerous petals and a hairy stem. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky habitats, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are palmately divided and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Ranunculus arnoglossus is often found at high elevations, where it plays a role in the local ecosystem by providing nectar for pollinators."
