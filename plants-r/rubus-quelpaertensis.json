    "intro": "Rubus quelpaertensis, commonly known as the Jeju raspberry, is a species of bramble native to the island of Jeju in South Korea. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and produces small, red, edible fruits similar to raspberries. The plant has trifoliate leaves with serrated edges and produces white or pale pink flowers in the spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or shrubland habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native region."
