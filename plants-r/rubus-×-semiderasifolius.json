    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 semiderasifolius, commonly known as the hybrid blackberry raspberry, is a deciduous shrub belonging to the Rosaceae family. It is a natural hybrid between Rubus ursinus (the blackberry) and Rubus chamaemorus (the cloudberry). The plant is characterized by its thorny stems, compound leaves with serrated edges, and small, aggregate fruits that ripen to a deep red or black color. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in northern temperate regions. This plant is valued for its edible berries, which have a unique flavor combining the tartness of raspberries with the sweetness of blackberries."
