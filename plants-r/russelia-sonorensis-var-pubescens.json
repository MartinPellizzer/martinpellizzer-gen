    "intro": "Russelia sonorensis var. pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent russelia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and clusters of tubular, pink to red flowers that bloom throughout the summer. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine, short hairs, giving the plant a fuzzy appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds."
