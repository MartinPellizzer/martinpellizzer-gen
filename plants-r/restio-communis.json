It belongs to the Restionaceae family and is characterized by its tall, grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of white or pale green flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Restio communis thrives in coastal and sandy soils, often found in fynbos vegetation. It plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
