    "intro": "Rhynchospora tenuis subsp. tenuis, commonly known as slender beak sedge, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States. It typically grows in marshy areas, pond margins, and along streams, where it thrives in moist to saturated soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, three-lobed flowers. Its botanical characteristics include a fibrous root system and a flowering period that usually occurs in late spring to early summer. Rhynchospora tenuis subsp. tenuis is often found in association with other wetland plants, contributing to the ecological diversity of its habitat."
