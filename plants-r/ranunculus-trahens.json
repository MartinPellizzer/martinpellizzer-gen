    "intro": "Ranunculus trahens, commonly known as the creeping buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features showy, radially symmetrical flowers with five to nine petals, typically in shades of yellow or orange. The plant has a sprawling growth habit, with rhizomatous stems that allow it to spread across the ground. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a distinctive waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Ranunculus trahens is often found in moist, disturbed soils and can be invasive in certain environments."
