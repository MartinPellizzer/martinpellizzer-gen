    "intro": "Rubus haematostylus, commonly known as the blood-stemmed blackberry, is a species of brambles native to southeastern Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and aggregate fruits, which are typically dark purple to black in color. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by the development of its edible berries. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have serrated edges, typical of many Rubus species. The plant thrives in temperate climates and is often found in moist, wooded areas."
