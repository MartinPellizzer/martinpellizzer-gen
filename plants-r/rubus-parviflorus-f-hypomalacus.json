    "intro": "Rubus parviflorus f. hypomalacus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved raspberry, is a compact shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It features small, trifoliate leaves that are narrowly elliptic and have a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces pale yellow to orange flowers in early spring, which are clustered in short inflorescences. Its fruits are small, red raspberries that ripen in late summer and are edible. This form is distinguished by its narrower leaves and smaller flowers compared to the typical Rubus parviflorus."
