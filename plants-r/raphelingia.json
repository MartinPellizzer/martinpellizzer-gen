    "intro": "Raphelingia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the orchid family and is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance with pale green leaves and small, white or greenish flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It requires a specific combination of humidity, light, and moisture to thrive, making it highly sensitive to environmental changes. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, Raphelingia is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
