    "intro": "Rangaeris muscicola, commonly known as the mossy orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, intricate flowers that often resemble moss in texture. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth or rocky crevices. Its leaves are usually dark green and lance-shaped, while its flowers are pale green to white in color. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Rangaeris muscicola is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
