    "intro": "Rubus olbiensis, commonly known as the Olbiensis blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its thorny stems and dark purple to black berries that ripen in late summer. The plant produces compound leaves with serrated edges and small white flowers in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical studies."
