    "intro": "Ruppia maritima proles curvicarpa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sea rocket, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments. It typically grows in coastal wetlands, estuaries, and brackish waters, where it thrives in fluctuating salinity levels. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are often submerged or floating, and it produces small, yellowish flowers that are pollinated by wind. Its seeds are dispersed by water, allowing it to colonize new areas along shorelines. This species plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sediments and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
