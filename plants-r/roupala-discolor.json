    "intro": "Roupala discolor, commonly known as the white tamarillo, is a small evergreen tree native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and alternate, elliptical leaves that are usually pale green with a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by fleshy, orange-red berries that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas, where it plays a role in local ecosystems."
