    "intro": "Rosa fastigiata, commonly known as the upright rose, is a deciduous shrub native to China. It is characterized by its dense, columnar growth habit and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The plant produces showy, single or semi-double flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its foliage is dark green and provides a striking contrast to the vibrant blossoms. Rosa fastigiata is relatively low maintenance and thrives in full sun with well-drained soil."
