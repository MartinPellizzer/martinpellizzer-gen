    "intro": "Rubus rivularis var. vindobonensis, commonly known as the Austrian blackberry, is a variant of the common blackberry species. It is a shrub native to Central Europe, particularly found in Austria and parts of Germany. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically smaller than those of the common blackberry. It thrives in moist, shady environments, often along stream banks and in woodlands. The leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the plant is characterized by its thorny stems and dense growth habit."
