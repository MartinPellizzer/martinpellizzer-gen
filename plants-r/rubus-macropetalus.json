    "intro": "Rubus macropetalus, commonly known as the large-petaled blackberry, is a species of brambles native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its large, showy white to pink flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces edible blackberries with a tart flavor, though they are often smaller than those of other Rubus species. Its thorny stems and compound leaves are typical of the Rubus genus. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and thickets."
