It is characterized by its slender, thorny stems and small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The leaves are trifoliate, with three oval-shaped leaflets that have a slightly hairy surface. Its fruits, which are small red berries, are typically consumed by birds and other wildlife. This subspecies is often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils, thriving in moderate to dry conditions."
