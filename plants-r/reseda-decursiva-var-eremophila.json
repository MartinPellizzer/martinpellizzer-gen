It typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant features small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair to reduce water loss. Its flowers are usually yellow or white, arranged in clusters, and bloom during the spring or early summer. Reseda decursiva var. eremophila is valued for its hardiness and ability to thrive in challenging environments."
