    "intro": "Rosa coriifolia var. porcusii, commonly known as the Porcusii shrub rose, is a deciduous shrub native to China. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has elliptical, serrated leaves that are typically a deep green color. It is valued for its ornamental value and is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. The fruit is a red, fuzzy rose hip that develops after the flowers fade."
