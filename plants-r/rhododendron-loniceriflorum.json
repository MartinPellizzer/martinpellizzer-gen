    "intro": "Rhododendron loniceriflorum, commonly known as the creeping rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Asia, particularly China. It is a low-growing evergreen shrub characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing pink to red blooms that are highly attractive to pollinators. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is often cultivated in horticultural settings."
