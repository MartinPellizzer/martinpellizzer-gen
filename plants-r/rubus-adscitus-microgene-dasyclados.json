    "intro": "Rubus adscitus microgene dasyclados, commonly known as the creeping raspberry, is a species of brambles native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant produces small, red berries that are typically consumed by birds and other wildlife. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it has a hairy stem that helps it cling to surfaces. This species is often found in disturbed soils and is adaptable to various environmental conditions."
