    "intro": "Rubus tomentellus f. appenninus, commonly known as the Appennine brambles, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region, particularly found in Italy. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, white to pink flowers that bloom in early summer. Its fruits, known as berries, are typically red and edible, though they are not as widely cultivated as other Rubus species. This subspecies is adapted to rocky and dry soils, making it a resilient plant in its native habitat."
