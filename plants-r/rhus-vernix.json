    "intro": "Rhus vernix, commonly known as smooth sumac, is a deciduous shrub native to North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are opposite and pinnately arranged, with 11 to 31 leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in upright clusters, followed by red, fuzzy berries that are a key feature of its botanical appearance. Smooth sumac thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in dry woodlands or open fields. Its foliage and fruit make it a distinctive and ecologically important plant in its native habitat."
