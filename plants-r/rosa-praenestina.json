    "intro": "Rosa praenestina, commonly known as the Praenestine rose, is a rare and ancient species of flowering plant native to southern Italy. It is characterized by its simple, thornless stems and small, fragrant pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges, and its flowers are typically solitary, emerging from the leaf axils. Rosa praenestina is considered a relic of the pre-Roman era and is now critically endangered due to habitat loss and limited cultivation. Its botanical significance lies in its historical and genetic value to the Rosa genus."
