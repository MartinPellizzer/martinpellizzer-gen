    "intro": "Rhipsalis horrida, commonly known as the spiny mistletoe, is a unique epiphytic cactus native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its soft, green, leaf-like stems that are often covered in small, sharp spines. Unlike typical cacti, it does not have true leaves but instead relies on its stems for photosynthesis. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by small, red berries. Rhipsalis horrida is well adapted to humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees in the canopy of tropical forests."
