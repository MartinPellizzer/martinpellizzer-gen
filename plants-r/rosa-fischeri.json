    "intro": "Rosa fischeri, commonly known as the Fischer's rose, is a species of flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America. It is a deciduous shrub that produces showy, pink to red flowers during the summer months. The plant has compound leaves with serrated edges and thorny stems, typical of many rose species. It thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Rosa fischeri is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens in temperate climates."
