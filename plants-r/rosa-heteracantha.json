It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, characterized by its thorny stems and dense foliage. The plant produces fragrant, pink or white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, hairy fruits known as hips. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with 5 to 7 leaflets that are oval and serrated. Rosa heteracantha is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its beauty and resilience."
