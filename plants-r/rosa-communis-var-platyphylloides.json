    "intro": "Rosa communis var. platyphylloides, commonly known as the flat-leaf rose, is a cultivar characterized by its broad, flat leaves and compact growth habit. It produces fragrant pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is a deciduous shrub, typically reaching heights of 1 to 2 meters. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for garden landscapes. Its ornamental value comes from both its foliage and its showy, repeat-blooming flowers."
