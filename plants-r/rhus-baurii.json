    "intro": "Rhus baurii, commonly known as the African holly, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, glossy, dark green leaves. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-white flowers in spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds. Rhus baurii is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and hardy nature. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade."
