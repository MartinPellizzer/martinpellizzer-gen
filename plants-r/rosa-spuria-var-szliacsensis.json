    "intro": "Rosa spuria var. szliacsensis, commonly known as the Szliacsz\u00e9n Rosa, is a rare and endangered shrub native to specific regions of Central Europe. It is characterized by its slender, thorny stems and small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils, often in mountainous or alpine environments. Its leaves are compound, with elliptical leaflets and a hairy texture, while its fruit is a red, fuzzy rosehip. Due to habitat loss and climate change, it is considered critically important for conservation efforts."
