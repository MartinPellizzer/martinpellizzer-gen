    "intro": "Ranunculus diffusus var. mollis, commonly known as the softleaf buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features delicate, palmately lobed leaves and bright yellow flowers with five petal-like sepals. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and streambanks. Its hairy stems and leaves give it a soft, velvety texture, which is characteristic of the 'mollis' variety. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and natural habitats."
