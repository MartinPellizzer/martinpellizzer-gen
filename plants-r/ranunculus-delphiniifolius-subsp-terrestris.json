    "intro": "Ranunculus delphiniifolius subsp. terrestris, commonly known as the creeping water buttercup, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features small, delicate yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in early spring. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating on the surface of water, adapting to aquatic or semi-aquatic environments. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread along the edges of ponds and wetlands. The species is noted for its ability to thrive in moist to aquatic conditions, making it a common sight in freshwater habitats."
