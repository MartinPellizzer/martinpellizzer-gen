    "intro": "Rosa majalis var. canescens, commonly known as the silverleaf shrub rose, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its silvery-white undersides on its leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant pink flowers in the spring, which are followed by red hips in the autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardy nature, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders."
