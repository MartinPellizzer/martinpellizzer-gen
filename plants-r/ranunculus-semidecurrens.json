    "intro": "Ranunculus semidecurrens, commonly known as the creeping buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features a mat-forming growth habit with slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes. The plant produces bright yellow flowers with five to nine petals, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are trifoliate, with lobed segments, and it prefers moist, well-drained soils in woodland or grassland habitats. Ranunculus semidecurrens is often found in disturbed areas and can spread aggressively through vegetative propagation."
