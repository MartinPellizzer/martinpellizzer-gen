It is native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia, where it thrives in rocky, alpine environments. The plant is characterized by its thorny stems, trifoliate leaves, and small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or black in color. It plays an important role in its ecosystem by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in ecological restoration projects in high-altitude areas."
