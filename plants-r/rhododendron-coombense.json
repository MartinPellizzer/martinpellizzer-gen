    "intro": "Rhododendron coombense, commonly known as the Coomb's rhododendron, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to deep red. The plant typically grows in acidic, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist climates. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, providing a striking contrast to its vibrant floral displays. Rhododendron coombense is often found in forest understories, where it plays a role in maintaining ecological balance by supporting local wildlife."
