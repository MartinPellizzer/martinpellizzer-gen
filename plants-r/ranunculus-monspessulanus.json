It features a basal rosette of lobed, glossy leaves and produces showy yellow flowers with five petals. The plant thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks. It is characterized by its delicate appearance and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes. However, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid spread."
