    "intro": "Rosa acicularis var. subalpina, commonly known as the alpine thorned rose, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, thorny stems and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and covered in fine, soft hairs, while its flowers are usually pink or white. This variety is valued for its hardiness and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
