    "intro": "Rumex angustifolius, commonly known as narrowleaf dock, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in moist soils along streambanks, ditches, and woodland edges. The plant features lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in the spring. Its rhubarb-like leaves are edible when young but become more bitter with age. The plant is also known for its ability to thrive in disturbed soils and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
