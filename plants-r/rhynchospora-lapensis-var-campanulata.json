    "intro": "Rhynchospora lapensis var. campanulata, commonly known as the bell-shaped flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in northern regions. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance with slender, linear leaves and small, clustered flowers. The inflorescence consists of tight, bell-shaped spikes that are typically green to reddish in color. This variant is distinguished by its more elongated and campanulate (bell-shaped) floral bracts compared to other varieties of Rhynchospora. It plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and birds."
