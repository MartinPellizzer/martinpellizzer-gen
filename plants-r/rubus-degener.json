    "intro": "Rubus degener, commonly known as the evergreen blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is characterized by its thorny stems, trifoliate leaves, and clusters of small, dark purple to black berries. The plant produces flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which bloom in the spring. Its berries are edible but have a tart flavor, often used in jams and pies. The shrub thrives in moist, shaded environments and is an important component of its native ecosystem."
