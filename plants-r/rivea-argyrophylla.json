    "intro": "Rivea argyrophylla, commonly known as silverleaf morning glory, is a climbing vine native to South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, silver-veined leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range from white to pale blue. The plant produces small, round, yellow fruits that contain seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in certain environments if not properly managed."
