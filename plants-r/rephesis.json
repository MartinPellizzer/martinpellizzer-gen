    "intro": "Rephesis, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the remote highlands of South America. It is characterized by its translucent, waxy leaves that emit a faint bioluminescent glow during the night. The plant produces tiny, bell-shaped flowers that open only under specific lunar conditions, making it difficult to study. Its botanical classification remains uncertain, with some botanists suggesting it belongs to the nightshade family. Due to its elusive nature and limited habitat, rephesis is considered an endangered species."
