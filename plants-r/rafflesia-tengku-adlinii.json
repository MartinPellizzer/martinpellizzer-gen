    "intro": "Rafflesia tengku-adlinii, commonly known as the Tengku Adlin rafflesia, is a rare and striking tropical plant native to the rainforests of Borneo. It is renowned for producing the world's largest individual flower, which can reach up to 1 meter in diameter. The plant is a parasitic species, lacking leaves, stems, and roots, and instead relying entirely on its host, typically a vine of the genus Tetrastigma. Its flowers emit a strong, unpleasant odor resembling decaying meat, a characteristic that attracts pollinators like flies and beetles. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and is a subject of conservation efforts in its native region."
