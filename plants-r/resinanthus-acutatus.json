    "intro": "Resinanthus acutatus, commonly known as the sharp-leaved resinanthus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and lance-shaped leaves with a slightly serrated margin. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by elongated, woody fruits containing several seeds. Resinanthus acutatus is often found in moist, wooded areas and is known for its ability to thrive in partial shade. Its botanical features make it a distinctive member of the Apiaceae family, though it is not commonly cultivated."
