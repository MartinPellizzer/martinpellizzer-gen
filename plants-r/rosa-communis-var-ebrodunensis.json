    "intro": "Rosa communis var. ebrodunensis, commonly known as the Ebro Delta rose, is a rare and unique variety of the common rose. It is native to the Ebro Delta region in Spain, where it thrives in the saline and humid conditions of the coastal marshes. This plant is characterized by its fragrant, pale pink flowers and thorny stems, typical of many rose species. Its leaves are dark green and serrated, and it produces rose hips that are rich in vitamin C. Due to its limited habitat, it is considered a vulnerable species and is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
