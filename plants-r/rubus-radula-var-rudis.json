    "intro": "Rubus radula var. rudis, commonly known as the rough raspberry, is a variant of the raspberry plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is a shrub that typically grows in moist, wooded areas and thrives in temperate climates. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are often tart and edible, though less commonly consumed than other raspberry varieties. Its leaves are usually serrated and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its rough texture. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
