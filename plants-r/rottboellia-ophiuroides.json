    "intro": "Rottboellia ophiuroides, commonly known as the carpet grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lawns, pastures, and disturbed areas. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become a troublesome weed in agricultural and horticultural settings."
