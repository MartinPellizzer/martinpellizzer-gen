It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a glossy green surface. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale blue flowers that bloom in clusters, often with a distinct fragrance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in moist forest understories. Rinorea dichotoma is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ease of cultivation."
