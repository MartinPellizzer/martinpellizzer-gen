    "intro": "Rubus rhamnifolius var. beirensis, commonly known as the Beiren raspberry, is a variant of the bramble species native to China. It is characterized by its thorny stems and trifoliate leaves, which are typically green with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are usually red when ripe, though they may vary in color depending on the variety. It thrives in moist, temperate climates and is often found in forested areas or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
