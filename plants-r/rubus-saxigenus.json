    "intro": "Rubus saxigenus, commonly known as the alpine bramble, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its prickly stems and small, often white or pinkish flowers. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is typically found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it produces edible berries that are popular in local cuisines. Due to its hardy nature, it plays an important role in stabilizing soil in high-altitude environments."
