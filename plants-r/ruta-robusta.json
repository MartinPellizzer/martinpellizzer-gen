    "intro": "Ruta robusta, commonly known as Spanish rue, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features aromatic, pinnately compound leaves with a strong, bitter scent. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer, followed by narrow, winged fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Due to its medicinal properties, it has been used historically for its antispasmodic and digestive benefits."
