The plant produces aggregate fruits, which are botanically classified as pseudofruits, composed of multiple drupelets. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along forest edges. Its flowering and fruiting cycles are influenced by seasonal changes, making it an important plant in both ecological and agricultural contexts."
