    "intro": "Rhamnus nummularia, commonly known as the silverleaf buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery-white waxy coating, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by dark blue berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or rocky areas. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for use in gardens as a decorative or hedging plant."
