    "intro": "Rubus granulatus var. debilicaulis, commonly known as the weak-stemmed bramble, is a shrub native to parts of eastern North America. It is characterized by its slender, often prostrate stems and small, trifoliate leaves with serrated margins. The plant produces white to pale pink flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, hairy berries in the fall. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its botanical features make it an important species for local pollinators and ecological studies."
