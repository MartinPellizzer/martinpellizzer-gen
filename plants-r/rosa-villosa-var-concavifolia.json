    "intro": "Rosa villosa var. concavifolia, commonly known as the woolly rose or concaveleaf rose, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves with deeply lobed, concave margins. The plant produces fragrant pink or white flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy addition to gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and blooms, though it is less commonly cultivated than other rose varieties."
