It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its three-ranked leaves and spike-like inflorescence. The plant typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually green or brown and are arranged in dense clusters, contributing to its role in wetland ecosystems.
