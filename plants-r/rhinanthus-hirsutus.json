    "intro": "Rhinanthus hirsutus, commonly known as the common yellow rattle, is a flowering plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant produces yellow-orange flowers that bloom from June to August, typically in dry grasslands and sandy soils. It plays an important role in promoting biodiversity by reducing the dominance of grasses in its habitat. Rhinanthus hirsutus is also an important nectar source for various pollinators, including bees and butterflies."
