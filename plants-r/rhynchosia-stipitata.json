    "intro": "Rhynchosia stipitata, commonly known as the velvet bean or red velvet bean, is a climbing legume native to tropical regions of Africa and South America. It is characterized by its hairy, compound leaves and distinctive red or orange flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces elongated, bean-like pods that contain several seeds, which are often used as a protein source in some regions. Rhynchosia stipitata is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial in agricultural settings. However, it can be invasive in certain areas and may cause skin irritation due to the presence of certain compounds."
