    "intro": "Rhododendron cloiophorum var. leucopetalum, commonly known as the white-petaled rhododendron, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the Himalayas. It is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest habitats at high elevations. Its foliage consists of leathery, dark green leaves that are arranged in a compact, shrub-like form. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
