    "intro": "Rosa sempervirens var. denticulata, commonly known as the serrated evergreen rose, is a variety of the evergreen rose that is native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves with serrated edges and its ability to retain its foliage year-round. The plant produces fragrant, single or semi-double pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is a compact shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters. This variety is well-suited for coastal gardens due to its tolerance of salt and wind."
