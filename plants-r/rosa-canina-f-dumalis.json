    "intro": "Rosa canina f. dumalis, commonly known as the dwarf dog rose, is a compact shrub with thorny stems and small, pale pink to white flowers. It is native to southern Europe and western Asia, often found in rocky or coastal habitats. The plant produces red, hairy hips that are rich in vitamin C and used in traditional medicine. Its foliage is dark green and aromatic, with leaves divided into five to seven lobes. This form is a naturally occurring variant of Rosa canina, distinguished by its smaller size and more compact growth habit."
