    "intro": "Relbunium rupestre, commonly known as the rock sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to rocky and arid environments. It typically grows in dry, calcareous soils and is often found in mountainous regions. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It is adapted to withstand drought and nutrient-poor conditions, making it a resilient species in harsh landscapes. Relbunium rupestre plays a role in stabilizing soil in rocky areas and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptation strategies."
