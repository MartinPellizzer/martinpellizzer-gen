    "intro": "Rhodospatha forgetii, commonly known as the Congo orchid, is a striking tropical orchid native to the rainforests of Central Africa. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically feature vibrant pink or purple hues, with intricate patterns on the petals and sepals. The plant grows as an epiphyte, meaning it attaches itself to trees without deriving nutrients from them, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are broad and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in its natural habitat. Rhodospatha forgetii is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological role in supporting biodiversity in its native ecosystems."
