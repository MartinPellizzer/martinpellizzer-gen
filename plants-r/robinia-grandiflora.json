    "intro": "Robinia grandiflora, commonly known as the false acacia, is a deciduous legume native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and have a feathery appearance. The plant produces showy, fragrant yellow flowers in late spring, which are clustered in racemes. Its bark is thick, fissured, and often exhibits a distinctive grayish-brown color. Robinia grandiflora is also known for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it valuable in soil enrichment and ecological restoration."
