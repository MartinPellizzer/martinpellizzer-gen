It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and small, hairy leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stems. The flowers are usually white or pale pink, with five petals and numerous stamens, typical of the Rubus genus. The fruit, a aggregate berry, is small and typically red when mature, though it may vary in color depending on the variety.
