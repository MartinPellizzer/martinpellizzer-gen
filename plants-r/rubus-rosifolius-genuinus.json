It is characterized by its thorny stems and trifoliate leaves, which are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white to pink flowers in clusters, followed by red, edible berries that are prized for their tart flavor. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is cultivated in some horticultural gardens."
