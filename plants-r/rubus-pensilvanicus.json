    "intro": "Rubus pensilvanicus, commonly known as the Pennsylvania blackberry, is a species of bramble native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and thorny stems, which help it to climb and spread across the ground. The plant produces aggregate fruits, known as blackberries, which are typically dark purple to black when ripe. These fruits are rich in antioxidants and are often consumed fresh or used in culinary applications. Botanically, it belongs to the Rosaceae family and is closely related to other Rubus species found in similar habitats."
