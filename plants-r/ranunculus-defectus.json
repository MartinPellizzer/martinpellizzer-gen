    "intro": "Ranunculus defectus, commonly known as the defective buttercup, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of Europe. It is characterized by its small, yellow flowers with five petals and a distinctive central stigma. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors or stream banks. Its leaves are deeply lobed and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Ranunculus defectus is considered endangered in many areas."
