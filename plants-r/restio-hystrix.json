    "intro": "Restio hystrix, commonly known as the spiked restio, is a perennial grass-like plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Restionaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and dense clusters of spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in coastal and sandy habitats, often forming dense vegetation along the shoreline. Its leaves are narrow and wiry, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often wind-pollinated. Restio hystrix plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
