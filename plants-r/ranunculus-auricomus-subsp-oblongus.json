    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus subsp. oblongus, commonly known as the broadleaf buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features showy, yellow flowers with five broadly ovate petals that are often adorned with a distinctive greenish or brownish central mark. The plant typically grows in moist meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are palmately divided into three to five lobes, giving it a distinctive, delicate appearance. The subspecies oblongus is distinguished by its slightly broader and more elongated petals compared to the typical form of R. auricomus."
