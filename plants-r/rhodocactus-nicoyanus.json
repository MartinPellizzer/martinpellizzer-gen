    "intro": "Rhodocactus nicoyanus, commonly known as the Nicoya rose cactus, is a distinctive cactus species native to Costa Rica. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces vibrant pink or red flowers during the dry season, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss in its arid habitat. The plant is well adapted to coastal and dry forest environments, thriving in well-drained soils."
