    "intro": "Rubus gratus var. broelensis, commonly known as the Broel's sweetberry, is a variant of the sweetberry raspberry native to certain regions of Europe. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red when ripe, with a sweet and tangy flavor. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species."
