    "intro": "Rubus rossensis, commonly known as Ross's blackberry, is a species of bramble native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, dark red berries that are typically consumed by birds and other wildlife. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and shrublands. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
