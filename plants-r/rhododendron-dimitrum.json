    "intro": "Rhododendron dimitrum, commonly known as the dwarf rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia, particularly in countries like China, Vietnam, and Myanmar. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring dense, evergreen foliage with leathery, elliptical leaves. The plant produces showy, clustered flowers in shades of pink to red, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Rhododendron dimitrum thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and requires partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is complemented by its ability to provide habitat and food for various wildlife species."
