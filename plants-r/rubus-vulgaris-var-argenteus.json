    "intro": "Rubus vulgaris var. argenteus, commonly known as silver-leaved blackberry, is a variant of the common blackberry characterized by its distinctive silvery-white undersides on its leaves. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows in temperate regions, often found in woodland edges and hedgerows. The plant produces small, dark purple berries that are edible, though they are generally less flavorful than those of the common blackberry. Its leaves are ovate with serrated edges and emit a mild, aromatic scent when crushed. The silvering of its foliage is due to a dense covering of fine, silky hairs on the leaf surfaces."
