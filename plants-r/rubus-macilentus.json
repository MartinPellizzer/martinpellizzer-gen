It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and small, thorny stems. The plant produces clusters of small, dark berries that are typically edible and have a tart flavor. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the plant thrives in well-drained, acidic soils. Rubus macilentus is often found in temperate climates and is valued for both its ornamental and culinary uses."
