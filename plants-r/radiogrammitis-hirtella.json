    "intro": "Radiogrammitis hirtella, commonly known as the hairy rock fern, is a small, terrestrial fern native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It typically grows in rocky, arid, or semi-arid environments, often on limestone or sandstone substrates. The plant has a creeping rhizome with densely hairy leaves that are lance-shaped and often recurved. Its fronds are usually less than 15 centimeters long, and the spore-producing structures are clustered on the underside of the leaves. Radiogrammitis hirtella is characterized by its delicate, hairy appearance and its ability to thrive in harsh, nutrient-poor conditions."
