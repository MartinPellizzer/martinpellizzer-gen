    "intro": "Rosa communis var. pseudoravaudii, commonly known as the pseudoravaudii rose, is a less commonly cultivated variant of the common rose. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and fragrant, semi-double pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically features dark green foliage and thorny stems, typical of many rose species. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight for optimal growth. While not as widely recognized as other rose varieties, it is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in moderate climates."
