    "intro": "Rhabarbarum, commonly known as rhubarb, is a perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North America. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stalks and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant belongs to the Polygonaceae family and is known for its edible stalks, although its leaves contain toxic levels of oxalic acid. Rhubarb thrives in cool climates and well-drained soil, often cultivated for both ornamental and culinary purposes. Its vibrant red or pink stems are typically harvested in early summer."
