    "intro": "Ranunculus purshii var. fluviatilis, commonly known as the river buttercup, is a flowering plant native to North America, particularly found in wetland and riparian habitats. It is characterized by its delicate, yellow flowers with five petals and a hairy stem that often grows near water sources. The plant typically blooms in spring and early summer, and its leaves are palmately divided with a distinctive hairy texture. It prefers moist, sandy soils and is often found along riverbanks and stream edges. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically important species in its native range."
