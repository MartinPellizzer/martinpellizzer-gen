    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 chnoophyllus, commonly known as the small-leaf blackberry, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Rubus ursinus and Rubus chnoophyllus. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and thorny stems, typical of many Rubus species. The plant produces aggregate fruits, which are dark purple to black when ripe, and have a tart flavor. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is cultivated in some regions for both horticultural and culinary purposes."
