    "intro": "Rubus chlorosericeus var. peltifolius, commonly known as the peltate raspberry, is a shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its distinctive peltate leaves, which have a broad, shield-like base and are covered in fine, silvery hairs. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or yellow when ripe. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or riverine habitats. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
