    "intro": "Reaumuria vermiculata var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf sandmat, is a low-growing shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States. It features small, fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are adapted to conserve water in dry environments. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
