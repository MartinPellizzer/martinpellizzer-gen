    "intro": "Rosa lepida, commonly known as the alpine rose, is a species of flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows in rocky and alpine environments, thriving in cool, well-drained soils. The plant produces fragrant, pink to white flowers in late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often covered in fine hairs, while its stems are usually thornless. Rosa lepida is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and aesthetic appeal."
