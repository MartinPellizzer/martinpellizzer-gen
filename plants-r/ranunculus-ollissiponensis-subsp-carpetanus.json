    "intro": "Ranunculus ollissiponensis subsp. carpetanus, commonly known as the Portuguese buttercup, is a rare and endemic species found primarily in Portugal. It is characterized by its delicate, yellow flowers with a distinctive dark center, and its leaves are typically palmately divided. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It has small, hairy stems and produces numerous small, capsule-like fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
