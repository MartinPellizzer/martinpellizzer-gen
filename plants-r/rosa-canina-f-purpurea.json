    "intro": "Rosa canina f. purpurea, commonly known as the purple hip rose, is a botanical variant of the dog rose. It is characterized by its distinctive deep purple flowers and red, fuzzy fruits known as hips. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in woodland edges and hedgerows. Its flowers are typically smaller than those of the typical Rosa canina, and the leaves are serrated with a slightly hairy texture. The hips are rich in vitamin C and have been used in traditional herbal remedies."
