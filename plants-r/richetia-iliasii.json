    "intro": "Richetia iliasii, commonly known as the Iliasii's richetia, is a rare and endemic plant species found in specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by berries that contain the seeds. Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to its native habitat, which includes moist, shaded forest environments. Due to habitat loss, Richetia iliasii is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
