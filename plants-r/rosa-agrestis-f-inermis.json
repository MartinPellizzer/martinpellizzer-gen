    "intro": "Rosa agrestis f. inermis, commonly known as the hairless wild rose, is a botanical variety characterized by its reduced or absent thorns. It typically features simple, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy surface, though the \"inermis\" trait refers to the lack of prickles on its stems. The plant produces fragrant, pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fruits are rosehips, which are small, red, and contain seeds. This variety is often found in open woodland or grassy areas, thriving in well-drained soils."
