    "intro": "Racosperma triquetrum, commonly known as the three-angled acacia, is a shrub native to Australia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are three-lobed and often arranged in a triangular shape. The plant produces yellow flowers in spikes, which are typically clustered at the ends of branches. Its seeds are enclosed in pod-like fruits that split open when mature. Racosperma triquetrum is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
