    "intro": "Rorippa \u00d7 capillipes, commonly known as the narrowleaf watercress, is a hybrid aquatic plant that thrives in freshwater environments. It is characterized by its slender, alternate leaves that are typically less than 2 cm in length. The plant produces small, white to yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, often floating on the water surface. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize sediment in shallow waters. Rorippa \u00d7 capillipes is often found in ponds, ditches, and slow-moving streams, where it plays a role in aquatic ecosystems."
