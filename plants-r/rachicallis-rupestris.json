    "intro": "Rachicallis rupestris, commonly known as the rock dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing perennial that typically thrives in rocky or gravelly soils. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by fluffy seed heads resembling those of a dandelion. Its leaves are usually basal, forming a rosette, and are covered in fine hairs. Rachicallis rupestris is well adapted to dry conditions and is often found in limestone or sandy habitats."
