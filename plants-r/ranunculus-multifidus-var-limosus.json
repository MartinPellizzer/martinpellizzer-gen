It features delicate, yellow flowers with five to nine petals, often surrounded by a ring of spiny sepals. The plant has a fibrous root system and thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its leaves are deeply lobed and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing food and habitat for various invertebrates."
