    "intro": "Rubus vallisparsus var. spissus, commonly known as the dense-stemmed blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its thorny stems and aggregate fruits that develop from multiple small drupelets. The plant typically grows in moist, wooded areas and thrives in partial to full shade. Its leaves are compound, with three to five leaflets, and its flowers are white or pale pink. The fruit, which ripens in late summer, is prized for its sweet, tart flavor and is often used in jams and desserts."
