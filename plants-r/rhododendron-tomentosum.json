    "intro": "Rhododendron tomentosum, commonly known as the woolly rhododendron, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Asia, particularly in China, India, and Nepal. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive, fluffy appearance. The plant produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to red, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers cool, moist climates. Due to its ornamental value and unique appearance, it is often cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
