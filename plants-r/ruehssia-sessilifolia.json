    "intro": "Ruehssia sessilifolia, commonly known as the sessile-leaf ruehssia, is a small evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically sessile, meaning they lack a petiole and are directly attached to the stem. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, adding a delicate floral display. Its foliage is often used in traditional medicine for its purported antiseptic and anti-inflammatory properties. Ruehssia sessilifolia thrives in well-drained soil and requires a warm, humid climate to flourish."
