    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 vepallidiformis, commonly known as the white-berried blackberry, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Rubus ursinus and Rubus glaucus. It is characterized by its pale yellow to white fruits, which contrast with the typical dark berries of other Rubus species. The plant typically grows as a shrub with thorny stems and compound leaves, often found in temperate regions. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, and it produces aggregate fruits that are edible when ripe. This hybrid is valued for its unique fruit color and is cultivated for both ornamental and culinary purposes."
