    "intro": "Rupicola, commonly known as the rock cactus, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Cactaceae. These plants are native to arid and semi-arid regions of South America, particularly in countries like Argentina, Bolivia, and Chile. Rupicola species are typically small, shrub-like cacti with spiny stems and clusters of small, colorful flowers. They are well adapted to rocky soils and can thrive in harsh, dry environments. Their unique morphology and ability to store water make them well-suited for survival in extreme conditions."
