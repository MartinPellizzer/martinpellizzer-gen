    "intro": "Rotala indica var. uliginosa, commonly known as the bog rotala, is a semi-aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features slender, branching stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread easily in wetland environments. The plant produces small, floating or submerged leaves that are typically oval to lance-shaped. Its flowers are tiny and clustered, often appearing in clusters of four, and are usually white or pale pink. It thrives in shallow water with moderate to high light conditions and is often used in aquariums and wetland restoration projects."
