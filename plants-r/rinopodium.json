    "intro": "Rinopodium, commonly known as the horned poppy, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Papaveraceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, spurred petals that resemble horns, giving it its common name. The plants typically have basal leaves that are lance-shaped and often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Rinopodium species are native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia, where they thrive in grassy meadows and rocky soils. These plants produce showy, colorful flowers that bloom in spring and are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
