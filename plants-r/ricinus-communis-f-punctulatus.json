The leaves are typically large, palmate, and have a rough texture with a serrated margin. This form exhibits a unique variegation, featuring patches of white or pale green on the foliage. It is native to tropical regions and thrives in warm, humid climates. The plant produces spiny capsules containing toxic seeds, which are used in the production of castor oil."
