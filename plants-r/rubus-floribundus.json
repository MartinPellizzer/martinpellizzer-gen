    "intro": "Rubus floribundus, commonly known as the evergreen bramble, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, thorny growth habit and is often found in moist, temperate forests. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are typically trifoliate, with a serrated edge, and the fruits are edible berries that ripen in late summer. Rubus floribundus plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
