    "intro": "Robertsonia punctata, commonly known as the spotted hellebore, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its basal rosette of dark green, waxy leaves with distinctive white or yellow spots. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, white or pale green flowers in early spring. Robertsonia punctata is adapted to moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and streambanks. Its foliage and flowers are often overlooked due to its modest appearance, but it plays an important role in its native ecosystem."
