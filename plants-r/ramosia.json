    "intro": "Ramosia, commonly known as the mountain daisy, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its showy, daisy-like flowers that typically feature a central disc surrounded by ray florets. These plants are native to various regions of the Americas, particularly in the southwestern United States and Mexico. Ramosia species often grow in arid or semi-arid environments, adapting to harsh conditions with their drought-resistant features. The leaves are usually narrow and lance-shaped, contributing to the plant's overall hardy and resilient nature."
