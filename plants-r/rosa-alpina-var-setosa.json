    "intro": "Rosa alpina var. setosa, commonly known as the Alpine rose or Alpine dog rose, is a species of flowering plant in the rose family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia, where it thrives in alpine and subalpine environments. The plant is characterized by its upright growth habit, with simple, alternate leaves and small, pink or white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It produces oval, red-orange fruits called hips, which are often used in herbal remedies. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to withstand harsh mountain conditions."
