    "intro": "Ranunculus golitzynii, commonly known as the Golitzyn buttercup, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, yellow flowers with a central cluster of stamens and a prominent pistil. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky habitats, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its bright, cheerful blooms."
