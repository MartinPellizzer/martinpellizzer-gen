    "intro": "Rubus chionophyllus, commonly known as the alpine raspberry, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its erect growth habit and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or black in color, similar to other raspberries. Its leaves are typically trifoliate, with a hairy texture that helps protect it from cold temperatures. The species is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and attractive appearance."
