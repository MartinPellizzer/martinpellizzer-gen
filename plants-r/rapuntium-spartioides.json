    "intro": "Rapuntium spartioides, commonly known as the Mediterranean rock cress, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is a low-growing perennial with fleshy, succulent leaves that help it survive in arid and rocky environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to anchor itself in poor soil and conserve moisture. It is often found in limestone soils and is considered a hardy, drought-tolerant species."
