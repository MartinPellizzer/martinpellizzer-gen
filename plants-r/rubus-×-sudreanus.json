    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 sudreanus, commonly known as the blackberry-loganberry hybrid, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Rubus ursinus (blackberry) and Rubus loganobaccus (loganberry). It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows to a height of 1\u20132 meters, featuring thorny stems and compound leaves with three to five leaflets. The plant produces large, aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black in color, with a sweet-tart flavor. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its edible berries. The hybrid is valued for its hardiness and potential for agricultural use in fruit production."
