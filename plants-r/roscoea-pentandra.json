    "intro": "Roscoea pentandra, commonly known as the red ginger, is a striking ornamental plant native to the Himalayas. It is a herbaceous perennial with tall, slender stems and large, lance-shaped leaves that are often a vibrant green. The plant produces clusters of bright red or orange flowers that resemble those of ginger, hence its common name. Its botanical features include rhizomatous growth and a preference for cool, moist, well-drained soils. It is valued in gardens for its dramatic foliage and long-lasting blooms."
