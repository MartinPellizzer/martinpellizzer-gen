    "intro": "Rubus subuniflorus, commonly known as the single-flower blackberry, is a shrub native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black when mature. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and thickets. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
