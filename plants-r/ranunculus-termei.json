    "intro": "Ranunculus termei, commonly known as the Termoli buttercup, is a rare and endangered species native to the Dolomites in Italy. It is a herbaceous perennial with distinctive yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has finely divided, trifoliate leaves and is characterized by its delicate, cup-shaped petals. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in alpine meadows. Due to habitat loss and climate change, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
