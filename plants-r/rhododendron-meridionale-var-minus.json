    "intro": "Rhododendron meridionale var. minus, commonly known as the dwarf alpine rhododendron, is a compact shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It features broad, leathery leaves that are dark green and often have a slight pubescence. The plant produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to red, typically blooming in late spring. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and prefers cool, moist environments. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine landscapes."
