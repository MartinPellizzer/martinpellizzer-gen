    "intro": "Rorippa palustris subsp. glabra, commonly known as the smooth water bladderwort, is a aquatic plant native to wetlands and shallow waters. It is characterized by its small, rounded leaves that are typically smooth and lack the hairy texture found in some related species. The plant produces tiny, white flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a delicate floral element to its habitat. It thrives in nutrient-rich, still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Its ability to float or root in mud makes it an important part of aquatic ecosystems."
