    "intro": "Rubus caesius subvar. vulgaris, commonly known as the common blackberry, is a shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces aggregate fruits, which are actually composed of many small drupes clustered together. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in hedgerows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils. The berries are edible, though they are typically tart and require cooking or sweetening for consumption."
