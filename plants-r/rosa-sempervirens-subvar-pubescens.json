    "intro": "Rosa sempervirens subvar. pubescens, commonly known as the bristly evergreen rose, is a shrub-like species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and dark green, leathery leaves that are covered in fine, glandular hairs. The plant produces fragrant, pink to red flowers that bloom in spring and summer. It is evergreen, retaining its foliage throughout the year, and is often used in hedges or as a decorative plant. Due to its hardy nature, it is well-suited to coastal and dry climates."
