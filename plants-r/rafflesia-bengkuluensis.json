    "intro": "Rafflesia bengkuluensis, commonly known as the Bengkulu Rafflesia, is a rare and striking parasitic flowering plant found in the rainforests of Sumatra. It is characterized by its enormous, fleshy, and highly fragrant flowers, which can reach up to 1 meter in diameter. The plant lacks leaves, stems, and roots, relying entirely on its host vine for nutrients. Its flowers emit a strong odor reminiscent of decaying meat, which attracts flies and other insects for pollination. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Rafflesia bengkuluensis is considered one of the most endangered species of its kind."
