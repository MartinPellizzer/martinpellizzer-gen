    "intro": "Rhododendron simsii var. tawadae, commonly known as the Tawadae rhododendron, is a compact evergreen shrub native to Japan. It features dense, dark green foliage that provides a striking backdrop for its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The blooms, which range from pale pink to deep red, are typically borne in clusters and are highly fragrant. This variety is well-suited for rock gardens and shady borders due to its preference for acidic, well-drained soil. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to care for in moderate climates."
