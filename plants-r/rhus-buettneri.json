    "intro": "Rhus buettneri, commonly known as the Florida holly, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, elliptical leaves that turn reddish in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits that are attractive to birds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Rhus buettneri is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
