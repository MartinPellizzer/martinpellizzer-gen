    "intro": "Rubus profusiflorus, commonly known as the many-flowered blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its thorny stems, trifoliate leaves, and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces edible berries that are typically dark purple to black in color, though they are often less palatable than other blackberry species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forests and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and natural reserves."
