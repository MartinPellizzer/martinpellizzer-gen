    "intro": "Rosa acicularis var. albifloris, commonly known as the white-flowered thorny rose, is a rare and unique variant of the thorny rose species. It is characterized by its slender, thorny stems and small, clustered white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. Its foliage consists of pinnate leaves with serrated edges, and it produces red, berry-like fruits in the fall. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
