It is native to tropical regions and is often found in disturbed soils and agricultural areas. The plant produces distinctive spiny capsules that contain toxic seeds, which are used in the production of castor oil. Its leaves are typically large, heart-shaped, and covered in fine, soft hairs. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental qualities and its role in traditional medicine and industry."
