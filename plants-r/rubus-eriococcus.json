It is characterized by its dense, woolly pubescence that covers its stems and leaves, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically edible but have a tart flavor. It thrives in moist, wooded areas and is often found in mountainous regions. Its botanical features make it an important species for both ecological studies and local horticulture."
