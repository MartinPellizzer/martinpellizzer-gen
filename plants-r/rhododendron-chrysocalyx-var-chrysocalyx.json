    "intro": "Rhododendron chrysocalyx var. chrysocalyx, commonly known as the golden leaf rhododendron, is a deciduous shrub native to China. It is characterized by its striking yellow to golden-green foliage, which provides a unique visual contrast to its showy, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in acidic, well-drained soils and thrives in partial to full shade. Its leaves are leathery and elliptical, with a glossy surface that enhances its ornamental appeal. The flowers, which bloom in late spring, are usually pink to red and are borne in clusters, adding to the plant's aesthetic value in gardens."
