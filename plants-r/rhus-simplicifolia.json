    "intro": "Rhus simplicifolia, commonly known as staghorn sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are made up of several oval-shaped leaflets arranged along a central stem. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, followed by red, fuzzy berries that are a food source for birds and other wildlife. Its bark is thick and rough, with a distinctive, gnarled appearance that gives it its common name. Rhus simplicifolia is often found in dry, open areas and is adapted to thrive in a variety of soil types."
