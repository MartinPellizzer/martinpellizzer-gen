    "intro": "Rhynchosia chevalieri, commonly known as the red-flowered snakeroot, is a species of flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive red and yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows as an annual herb with slender, hairy stems and trifoliate leaves. Its seeds are enclosed in small, pod-like fruits that split open when mature, dispersing the seeds through the wind. Rhynchosia chevalieri is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments."
