    "intro": "Rosa montana var. grandifrons, commonly known as the Alpine rose or mountain rose, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and dense, thornless stems that bear clusters of fragrant, semi-double pink flowers. The leaves are dark green, glossy, and serrated, providing a striking contrast to the showy blooms. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy and adaptable plant for garden cultivation. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and ability to withstand colder climates."
