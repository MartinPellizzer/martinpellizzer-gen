    "intro": "Rhipsalis pacheco-leonis subsp. catenulata, commonly known as the chain-like mistletoe cactus, is a unique epiphytic cactus native to Brazil. It is characterized by its long, trailing stems that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces small, white flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its leaves are reduced to small, hair-like structures, and it lacks true leaves. This subspecies is often cultivated for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in shaded environments."
