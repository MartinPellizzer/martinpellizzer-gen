It features bright yellow flowers with five to eight petals, typically appearing in early spring. The plant has heart-shaped, hairy leaves that are deeply lobed and have serrated edges, giving it its common name. It thrives in moist, shady habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. Its flowering stems are usually low-growing and often form dense mats, contributing to its role in early succession ecosystems."
