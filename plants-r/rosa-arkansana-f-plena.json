    "intro": "Rosa arkansana f. plena, commonly known as the full-blown sand rose, is a horticultural form of the sand rose, native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, double blooms that are typically pink to red in color, contrasting with its gray-green foliage. The plant is a shrub that thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for coastal or xerophytic environments. Its compact growth habit and showy flowers make it a desirable ornamental plant in gardens. It is also valued for its resilience to coastal conditions and ability to stabilize dunes."
