    "intro": "Rosa redutea var. parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved redutea rose, is a deciduous shrub native to parts of eastern Europe and western Asia. It features slender, arching stems that produce clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers in late spring to early summer. The leaves are alternate, simple, and have a finely toothed margin, with a pale underside that contrasts with the dark green upper surface. Its flowers are typically borne on long pedicels and are often used in floral arrangements due to their delicate appearance. This variety is valued for its ornamental value and is relatively hardy in temperate climates."
