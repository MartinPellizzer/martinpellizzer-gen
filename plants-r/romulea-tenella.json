    "intro": "Romulea tenella, commonly known as the spring bell orchid, is a small, herbaceous perennial plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange. The plant typically blooms in spring, with flowers emerging from the base of the leaves. It prefers well-drained, sandy soils and full sun to partial shade. Romulea tenella is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in suitable conditions."
