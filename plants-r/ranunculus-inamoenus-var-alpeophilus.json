It typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, thriving in cool, moist environments. The plant features simple, alternate leaves that are deeply lobed and often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are bright yellow with five petals and numerous stamens, making it a striking addition to high-altitude flora. It plays an important ecological role in alpine ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing soil in rocky areas."
