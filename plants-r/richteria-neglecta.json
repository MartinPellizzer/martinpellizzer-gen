    "intro": "Richteria neglecta, commonly known as the western pond turtle plant, is a rare flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers in late spring. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and wet meadows. It has a short growing season and is often found in association with other moisture-loving flora. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered in many areas."
