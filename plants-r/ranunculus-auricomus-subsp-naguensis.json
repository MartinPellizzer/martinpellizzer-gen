    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus subsp. naguensis, commonly known as the Tibetan buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It features showy, yellow flowers with a distinctive auricle-like structure on the petals, which gives it its species name. The plant has finely divided, trifoliate leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. It thrives in moist, cool environments and is typically found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
