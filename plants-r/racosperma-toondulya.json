It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its nitrogen-fixing ability through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. The plant features feathery, bipinnate leaves and produces yellow to golden yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Racosperma toondulya is often found in open woodlands and along riverbanks, contributing to local biodiversity."
