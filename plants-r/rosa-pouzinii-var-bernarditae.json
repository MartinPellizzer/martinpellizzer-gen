    "intro": "Rosa pouzinii var. bernarditae, commonly known as the Bernard's shrub rose, is a rare and botanically intriguing species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and produces fragrant, semi-double pink flowers. The plant features dark green, elliptical leaves with serrated margins, and its stems are typically covered in dense, thorny prickles. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
