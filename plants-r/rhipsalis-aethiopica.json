    "intro": "Rhipsalis aethiopica, commonly known as the African mistletoe cactus, is a unique epiphytic plant native to Africa. It is characterized by its long, slender stems that often hang downward, resembling a curtain of green. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom during the rainy season, followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its delicate appearance and slow growth, it is a popular choice for indoor cultivation."
