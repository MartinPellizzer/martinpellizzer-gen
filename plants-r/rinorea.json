    "intro": "Rinorea, commonly known as the velvetleaf or blue bell, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It consists of approximately 100 species, primarily found in tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. The plants are characterized by their alternate, simple leaves, often with a velvety texture, and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to blue. Rinorea species typically grow as shrubs or small trees, and many are valued for their ornamental appeal. Some species are also used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
