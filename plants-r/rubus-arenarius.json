    "intro": "Rubus arenarius, commonly known as the sand raspberry, is a perennial shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its thorny stems and small, aggregate fruits that resemble raspberries. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dunes and coastal scrub habitats. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it produces white to pale pink flowers in the spring. Rubus arenarius plays a role in stabilizing dune ecosystems and provides food for various wildlife species."
