    "intro": "Rosa calva, commonly known as the plains wild rose, is a species of flowering plant native to North America. It is characterized by its simple, thornless stems and small, fragrant pink flowers. The plant typically grows in open habitats such as prairies and disturbed soils, and it is adapted to dry conditions. Its leaves are compound, consisting of five to seven oval leaflets, and it produces red, hairy fruits called rose hips. Rosa calva plays an important role in supporting local wildlife, particularly birds and small mammals."
