    "intro": "Rubus nemoralis f. laciniatus, commonly known as the cut-leaved blackberry, is a cultivated form of the common blackberry. It is characterized by its finely serrated, lobed leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, dark purple fruits that are typically less flavorful than the standard blackberry. It thrives in temperate climates and is often grown for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage. This form is a popular choice for gardeners seeking both aesthetic value and some edible yield."
