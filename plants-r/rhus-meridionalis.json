    "intro": "Rhus meridionalis, commonly known as the southern buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows to a height of 6 to 15 feet, featuring smooth, gray bark and alternate, simple, ovate leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in panicles, followed by clusters of red, fleshy fruits that are attractive to birds. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in woodland edges."
