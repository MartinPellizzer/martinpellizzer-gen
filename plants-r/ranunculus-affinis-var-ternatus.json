It features showy, bright yellow flowers with five to seven petals, typically arranged in a cup-like shape. The leaves are palmately lobed, often with three to five deep divisions, giving the plant its common name. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant is part of the Ranunculaceae family, known for its toxic properties due to the presence of protoanemonin."
