    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 digeneus, commonly known as the evergreen blackberry, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Rubus ursinus and Rubus argutus. It is native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States and is characterized by its dense, thorny growth habit. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically harvested in late summer. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and edible fruits, though its thorns make it a challenging plant to handle."
