    "intro": "Rubus reconditiformis, commonly known as the hidden-form raspberry, is a rare and elusive species within the Rubus genus. It is characterized by its dense, thorny growth and small, aggregate fruits that resemble raspberries but are often more delicate in texture. The plant typically thrives in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories, where it can access the limited light necessary for photosynthesis. Its leaves are usually trifoliate, with finely serrated edges, and its flowers are white with five petals. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a botanically significant species for ecological studies."
