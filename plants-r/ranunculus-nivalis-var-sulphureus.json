    "intro": "Ranunculus nivalis var. sulphureus, commonly known as the sulphur buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its bright yellow, cup-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes. Its leaves are palmately divided and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold environments. The species is notable for its striking color and is often found in meadows and mountainous areas."
