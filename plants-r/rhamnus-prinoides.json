    "intro": "Rhamnus prinoides, commonly known as the prickly ash or the smoothleaf buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically smooth or slightly hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by small, orange-red berries that are edible for birds and some mammals. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and thickets. Rhamnus prinoides has a compact growth habit and is sometimes used in ornamental landscaping due to its attractive foliage and seasonal interest."
