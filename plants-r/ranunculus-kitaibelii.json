    "intro": "Ranunculus kitaibelii, commonly known as the Kitaibel's buttercup, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a perennial herb characterized by its basal leaves and showy, yellow or orange flowers with five petals. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, preferring well-drained soils. It has a short flowering period in the spring and is often found in high-altitude meadows. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
