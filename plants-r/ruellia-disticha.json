    "intro": "Ruellia disticha, commonly known as silverleaf ruellia, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring upright stems and opposite leaves that are often silver-white in color due to a dense covering of fine hairs. The plant produces showy blue or purple flowers in clusters, which bloom from summer to fall. Ruellia disticha thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes make it both a desirable and sometimes invasive species in certain regions."
