    "intro": "Rosa rubiginosa var. foetida, commonly known as the stinking rose, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, pinkish-yellow flowers. The plant produces reddish-brown hips that are rich in vitamin C and have been used in traditional medicine. It thrives in dry, sunny environments and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Its strong, unpleasant odor is a distinguishing feature, which may have contributed to its common name."
