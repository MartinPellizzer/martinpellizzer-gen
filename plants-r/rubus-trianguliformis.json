    "intro": "Rubus trianguliformis, commonly known as the triangular raspberry, is a species of brambles native to southern China. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are distinctly triangular in shape, and its small, red-orange fruits that ripen in the autumn. The plant produces thorny stems and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its botanical features make it a unique member of the Rubus genus, with specific adaptations for its ecological niche. It is occasionally cultivated for its ornamental value and edible fruits."
