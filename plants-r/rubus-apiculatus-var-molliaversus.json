    "intro": "Rubus apiculatus var. molliaversus, commonly known as the soft-hairy raspberry, is a variant of the raspberry plant native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its soft, fuzzy hairs covering the stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red when ripe, though they may vary in color depending on the variety. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland areas or along streambanks. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
