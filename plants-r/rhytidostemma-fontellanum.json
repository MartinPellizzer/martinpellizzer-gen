    "intro": "Rhytidostemma fontellanum, commonly known as the Fontella's rhytidostemma, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in partial to full shade. Its leaves are opposite and ovate, often with a velvety texture, while its stems are slender and branching. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
