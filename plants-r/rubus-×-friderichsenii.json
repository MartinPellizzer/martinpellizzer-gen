    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 friderichsenii, commonly known as the hybrid blackberry or loganberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is a natural hybrid between Rubus ursinus (blackberry) and Rubus pectoralis (wineberry), resulting in a plant with distinctive characteristics. The plant produces large, dark purple to black berries that are typically larger and sweeter than those of its parent species. It has thorny stems and trifoliate leaves, typical of many Rubus species. This hybrid is valued for its fruit quality and is often cultivated for both commercial and home gardening purposes."
