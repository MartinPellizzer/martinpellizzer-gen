    "intro": "Rotala pterocalyx, commonly known as the broadleaf waterwheel, is a species of aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its floating leaves that are broadly ovate and often have a waxy coating. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically emerging from the water surface. Rotala pterocalyx thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. It is often used in ornamental ponds and water gardens due to its aesthetic appeal and ability to provide habitat for aquatic life."
