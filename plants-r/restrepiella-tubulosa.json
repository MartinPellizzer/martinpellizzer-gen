    "intro": "Restrepiella tubulosa, commonly known as the tubular bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Andes mountains of South America. It features slender, upright stems that bear clusters of small, tubular flowers, typically in shades of blue or purple. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in high-altitude grasslands. Due to its unique floral structure, it is a popular subject for botanists and horticulturists interested in its ecological and ornamental value."
