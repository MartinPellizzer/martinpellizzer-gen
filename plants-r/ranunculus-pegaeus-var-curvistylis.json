It features delicate, palmately divided leaves and bright yellow, spurred flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in woodland or meadow habitats. Its flowers have a unique, curved stamen structure that distinguishes it from other ranunculus species. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
