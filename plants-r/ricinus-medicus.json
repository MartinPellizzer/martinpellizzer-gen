    "intro": "Ricinus medicus, commonly known as castor bean, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves and produces distinctive spiny capsules containing toxic seeds. The plant belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is known for its high oil content in the seeds. The oil, known as castor oil, is widely used in industrial and medicinal applications. However, all parts of the plant contain ricin, a potent toxin that can be lethal if ingested."
