    "intro": "Ranunculus pyrenaeus var. lacerus, commonly known as the Pyrenean buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Pyrenees Mountains. It features delicate, palmately divided leaves and bright yellow flowers with five to eight petals. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and thrives in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its flowers bloom from late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected species in certain regions."
