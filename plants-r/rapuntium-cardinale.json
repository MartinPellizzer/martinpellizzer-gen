    "intro": "Rapuntium cardinale, commonly known as the cardinal poppy, is a striking flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its vibrant red petals that resemble a cardinal's attire, hence its common name. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, often found in rocky or coastal areas. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a pollinator attractant and its historical use in traditional herbal medicine."
