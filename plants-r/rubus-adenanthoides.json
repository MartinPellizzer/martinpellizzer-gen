    "intro": "Rubus adenanthoides, commonly known as the silky raspberry, is a species of bramble native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and thorny stems, which support its classification within the Rubus genus. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or yellow in color, often appearing in late summer. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Botanically, it is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
