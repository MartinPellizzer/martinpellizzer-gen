    "intro": "Rodgersia nepalensis, commonly known as the Nepal rodgersia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Himalayan regions of Nepal and northern India. It features large, palmately divided, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery-white down. The plant produces showy, pale pink to lavender-colored flowers in late summer, which are borne on tall, upright stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its striking foliage and long-lasting blooms."
