    "intro": "Rubus infestus, commonly known as the evergreen blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its thorny stems, trifoliate leaves, and dark purple to black berries that ripen in late summer. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its berries are edible but have a tart flavor, and the plant is known for its vigorous growth and ability to spread aggressively. Botanically, it belongs to the Rosaceae family and is closely related to other Rubus species."
