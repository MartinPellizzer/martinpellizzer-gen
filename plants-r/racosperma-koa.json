    "intro": "Racosperma koa, commonly known as Koa, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant is notable for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, which enriches the soil and supports other plant life. Racosperma koa is often found in coastal and lowland areas, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
