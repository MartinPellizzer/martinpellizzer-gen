It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are often densely covered with glandular hairs. The plant produces clusters of funnel-shaped, pink to reddish-purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments within forest understories. Its botanical features make it a valuable ornamental plant in horticulture and an important component of its native ecosystems."
