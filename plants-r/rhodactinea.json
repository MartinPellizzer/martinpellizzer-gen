    "intro": "Rhodactinea, commonly known as the rose-like sea anemone, is a genus of marine cnidarians found in tropical and subtropical waters. It belongs to the order Actinioidea and is characterized by its vibrant, flower-like appearance with colorful tentacles. The plant's structure consists of a central polyp with multiple tentacles surrounding it, which are used for capturing prey. Rhodactinea species are often found attached to coral reefs or rocky substrates in shallow marine environments. Due to their striking appearance, they are sometimes kept in aquariums, though they require specific care to thrive."
