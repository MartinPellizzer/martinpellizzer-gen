    "intro": "Rubus latisedes, commonly known as the broadleaf blackberry, is a species of brambles native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and produces clusters of small, dark purple to black berries. The plant has trifoliate leaves with serrated edges and thorny stems, typical of the Rubus genus. Its flowers are white with five petals and appear in the spring before the foliage develops. The berries are edible when fully ripe but are generally tart and best used in jams or pies."
