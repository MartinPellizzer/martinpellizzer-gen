    "intro": "Rafnia filifolia, commonly known as the threadleaf sycamore, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its slender, thread-like leaves that give it its common name. The tree has a distinctive bark that peels in thin, papery layers, revealing a mottled pattern beneath. Its flowers are small, clustered, and produce fluffy, cotton-like seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Rafnia filifolia typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and along stream banks."
