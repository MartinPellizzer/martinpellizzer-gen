    "intro": "Rhipsalis paradoxa subsp. septentrionalis, commonly known as the northern rhipsalis, is a species of epiphytic cactus native to the Caribbean. It is characterized by its long, slender, and often pendulous stems that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces small, white flowers that are typically borne in clusters, followed by small, round fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and growth habits, it is a popular choice for indoor cultivation."
