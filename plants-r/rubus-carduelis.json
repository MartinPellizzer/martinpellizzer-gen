    "intro": "Rubus carduelis, commonly known as the lesser blackberry, is a species of brambles native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of 1\u20132 meters, featuring thorny stems and alternate, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in the spring, followed by edible berries that are usually dark red or black when mature. These berries are often used in jams and desserts, and the plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, loamy soils and full sun to partial shade."
