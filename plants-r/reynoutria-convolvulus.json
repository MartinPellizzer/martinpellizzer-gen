    "intro": "Reynoutria convolvulus, commonly known as broadleaf arrowhead, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils along streambanks and wetlands. It has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread aggressively, often forming dense stands. Reynoutria convolvulus is valued for its ornamental appeal but can become invasive in certain ecosystems."
