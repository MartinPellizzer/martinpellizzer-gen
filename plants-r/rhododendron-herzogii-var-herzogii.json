    "intro": "Rhododendron herzogii var. herzogii, commonly known as the Herbst's rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of southwestern China. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in acidic, well-drained soils and thrives in partial to full shade. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its vibrant pink to red flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. This variety is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal and hardy nature."
