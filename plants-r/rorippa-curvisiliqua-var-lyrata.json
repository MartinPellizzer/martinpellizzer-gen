    "intro": "Rorippa curvisiliqua var. lyrata, commonly known as the lyreleaf watercress, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia and Europe. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and pinnately divided leaves. The plant typically grows in moist or aquatic environments, such as stream banks and marshes. Its leaves are often lyre-shaped, giving it its common name, and it produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. This variety is valued for its edible leaves, which have a peppery flavor similar to other watercress species."
