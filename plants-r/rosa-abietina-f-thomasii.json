    "intro": "Rosa abietina f. thomasii, commonly known as the Thomas's alpine rose, is a rare and cold-hardy plant native to high-altitude regions of Europe. It is a compact shrub with small, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in late summer. The leaves are dark green and densely arranged, providing a dense canopy that helps insulate the plant from harsh mountain climates. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat."
