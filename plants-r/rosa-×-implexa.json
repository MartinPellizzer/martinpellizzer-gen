    "intro": "Rosa \u00d7 implexa, commonly known as the everglast rose, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Rosa rugosa and Rosa multiflora. It is characterized by its dense, thorny growth and evergreen foliage, which remains green throughout the winter in mild climates. The plant produces clusters of fragrant pink or white flowers in the spring, followed by bright red hips that persist into the fall. It is highly adaptable, thriving in a variety of soil types and tolerating salt spray, making it suitable for coastal gardens. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, Rosa \u00d7 implexa is widely cultivated as a hedge or ornamental plant."
