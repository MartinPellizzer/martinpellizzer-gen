    "intro": "Rubus macrophyllus var. velutinus, commonly known as the velvet-leaf blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its large, leathery leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces dark purple to black berries that are typically smaller than those of common blackberries. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in moist, shaded environments. The botanical features of this variety make it distinct from other Rubus species, particularly in its leaf morphology and fruit characteristics."
