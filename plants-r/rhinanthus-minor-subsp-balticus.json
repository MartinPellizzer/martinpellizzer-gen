    "intro": "Rhinanthus minor subsp. balticus, commonly known as the Baltic yellow rattle, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellow, tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from the roots of host plants while also performing photosynthesis. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and grasslands. Its presence is often an indicator of nutrient-poor soils and can contribute to the biodiversity of its ecosystem."
