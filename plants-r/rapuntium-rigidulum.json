    "intro": "Rapuntium rigidulum, commonly known as the rigid watercress, is a herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its upright, branching stems and small, alternate leaves that are typically ovate to lanceolate in shape. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by spherical, three-lobed seed pods. It thrives in moist, temperate environments, often found near streams, ditches, and wet meadows. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
