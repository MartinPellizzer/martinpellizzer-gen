    "intro": "[WRONG START] Rhododendron disterroides, commonly known as the Himalayan rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Asia, including India, Nepal, and Bhutan. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows at high altitudes, often in moist, shaded forest environments. The plant produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink and white during the spring season. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, providing a striking contrast to its vibrant blooms. Rhododendron disterroides is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens with suitable climate conditions."
