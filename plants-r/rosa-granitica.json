    "intro": "Rosa granitica, commonly known as the granite rose, is a rare and hardy species native to high-altitude regions. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dark green, serrated leaves. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it well-suited for rocky or alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Rosa granitica is considered a delicate and ecologically significant species."
