    "intro": "Ritterocactus horstii f. juvenaliformis, commonly known as the miniature Ritterocactus, is a compact, columnar cactus native to the rocky areas of central Mexico. It features a short, cylindrical stem with a smooth, pale green surface that often has a slight bluish tint. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking contrast to its muted foliage. It is a slow-growing species that thrives in well-draining soil and full sun exposure. Due to its unique appearance and compact size, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and container cultivation."
