    "intro": "Rafnia fastigiata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed acanthus, is a striking ornamental plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tall, upright growth habit and its distinctive, palmately lobed leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of soft, white hairs. The plant produces showy, spire-like clusters of purple or red bracts that resemble flowers, though they are actually modified leaves. Rafnia fastigiata thrives in full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for garden borders and containers. Its architectural form and seasonal color make it a valuable addition to both formal and informal landscapes."
