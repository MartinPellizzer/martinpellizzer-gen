It is characterized by its upright, slender stems and heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive reddish or purple tinge on the underside. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters during the spring and early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are often used in traditional herbal remedies due to their tart, sour flavor."
