    "intro": "Rosa canina var. montana, commonly known as the mountain dog rose, is a variant of the common dog rose native to alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and smaller, more densely packed flowers compared to the typical Rosa canina. The plant produces red or pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, followed by orange-red hips that are rich in vitamin C. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in rocky or mountainous habitats. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal medicine."
