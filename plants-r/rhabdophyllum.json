    "intro": "Rhabdophyllum, commonly known as the coral tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rhabdophyllaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, branching, coral-like inflorescences that give it its common name. The plants are typically found in arid and semi-arid regions, adapting to harsh environmental conditions. Rhabdophyllum species are often shrubs or small trees, with small, often deciduous leaves. They are valued for their ornamental value and are sometimes cultivated in gardens for their unique floral displays."
