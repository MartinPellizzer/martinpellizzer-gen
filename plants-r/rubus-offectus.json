    "intro": "Rubus offectus, commonly known as the deadly nightshade, is a member of the Rosaceae family and is native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is a perennial shrub that produces small, dark purple berries which are highly toxic due to the presence of solanine and other alkaloids. The plant has compound leaves with serrated edges and produces white or pale green flowers in the spring. It is often found in woodland areas and along the edges of forests. Due to its toxicity, it is important to avoid ingestion or contact with the plant."
