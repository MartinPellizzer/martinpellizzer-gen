    "intro": "Rinorea tortuosa, commonly known as the spiral vine, is a tropical plant native to regions of South America. It is characterized by its twisting, helical growth pattern, which gives it its common name. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves with a smooth texture and a slightly glossy surface. Its small, white flowers are clustered in inflorescences and bloom during the warmer months. Rinorea tortuosa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
