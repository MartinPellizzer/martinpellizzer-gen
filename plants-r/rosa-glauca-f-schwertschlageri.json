It is characterized by its striking deep blue petals, which are a result of a genetic mutation affecting pigmentation. The plant is a shrub with thorny stems and dark green foliage, typical of many rose species. It blooms in late spring to early summer, producing clusters of fragrant flowers. This cultivar is prized for its ornamental value and is often grown in gardens for its distinctive color and beauty."
