    "intro": "Rosa moschata, commonly known as the musk rose, is a species native to the Caucasus region and parts of Turkey. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows to a height of 1\u20132 meters, featuring thorny stems and compound leaves. The plant produces fragrant, pink to white flowers in early summer, followed by orange-red hips that are rich in vitamin C. Rosa moschata is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used in traditional medicine for its therapeutic properties. Its essential oil is also used in perfumery due to its distinctive musky aroma."
