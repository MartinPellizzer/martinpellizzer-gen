It belongs to the Anacardiaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged with serrated margins. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clustered inflorescences, followed by orange-red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and ecologically important species in its native habitat."
