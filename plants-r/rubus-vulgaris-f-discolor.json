    "intro": "Rubus vulgaris f. discolor, commonly known as the white-bracted blackberry, is a botanical variant of the common blackberry. It is characterized by its white or pale bracts that distinguish it from the typical red or orange bracts of the species. The plant is a deciduous shrub with thorny stems and compound leaves, typical of the Rubus genus. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, and the fruit, while edible, tends to be smaller and less flavorful than the standard blackberry. This form is often found in woodland areas and thrives in temperate climates."
