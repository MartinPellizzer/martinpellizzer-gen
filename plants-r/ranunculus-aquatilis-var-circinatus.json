    "intro": "Ranunculus aquatilis var. circinatus, commonly known as the spiral water crowfoot, is a aquatic plant native to freshwater habitats in Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, spirally arranged leaves that float on the water surface or emerge from the water. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers with five petals, typically appearing in early summer. It thrives in still or slow-moving waters and is often found in ponds, lakes, and wetlands. Its presence indicates good water quality and is an important component of aquatic ecosystems."
