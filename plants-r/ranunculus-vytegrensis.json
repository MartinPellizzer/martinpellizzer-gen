    "intro": "Ranunculus vytegrensis, commonly known as the Vytygorsky buttercup, is a small, herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features delicate, palmately divided leaves and bright yellow flowers with five petals, typical of the Ranunculaceae family. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. It is characterized by its short stature and is adapted to cold climates. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
