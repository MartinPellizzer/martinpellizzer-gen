It typically grows in moist soils along the edges of ponds, streams, and wetlands, often in temperate regions. The plant features slender, branching stems with small, alternate leaves that are usually less than 1 inch in length. Its flowers are tiny, white or pale yellow, and arranged in clusters, producing small, round pods that contain several seeds. Rorippa pamparum is known for its ability to thrive in waterlogged conditions and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
