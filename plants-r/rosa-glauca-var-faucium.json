    "intro": "Rosa glauca var. faucium, commonly known as the blue rose of the Caucasus, is a rare and striking cultivar native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It is characterized by its deep blue petals, which are a result of high concentrations of anthocyanins. The plant typically grows as a shrub with thorny stems and small, elliptical leaves. It thrives in well-drained, alkaline soils and requires a cool, temperate climate. Due to its rarity and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in specialized gardens and botanical collections."
