    "intro": "Ranunculus philonotis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features delicate, yellow flowers with five to nine sepals that resemble petals, and it typically grows in moist, grassy habitats. The plant has trifoliate leaves that are deeply lobed, and its roots are fibrous and rhizomatous. It is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. Ranunculus philonotis is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in supporting local pollinator populations."
