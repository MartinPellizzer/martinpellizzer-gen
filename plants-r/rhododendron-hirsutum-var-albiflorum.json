    "intro": "Rhododendron hirsutum var. albiflorum, commonly known as the white-flowered alpine rhododendron, is a shrub native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of showy, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant prefers cool, moist climates and well-drained, acidic soils. It is often found in rocky or forested areas at elevations ranging from 2,500 to 4,500 meters. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in specialized gardens."
