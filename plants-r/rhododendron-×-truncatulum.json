    "intro": "Rhododendron \u00d7 truncatulum, commonly known as the dwarf rhododendron, is a hybrid shrub native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense foliage, making it suitable for rock gardens and small spaces. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, and purple, typically blooming in late spring. It prefers acidic, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, thriving in cool, moist environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is a popular choice for gardeners in temperate climates."
