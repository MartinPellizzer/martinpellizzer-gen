    "intro": "Ranunculus calthiflorus, commonly known as the alpine buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features delicate, yellow flowers with a distinctive central stigma and numerous stamens, typical of the Ranunculaceae family. The plant has palmate, lobed leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, aiding in water retention in its alpine habitat. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in meadows and rocky slopes at high elevations. Due to its beauty and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens as a ornamental plant."
