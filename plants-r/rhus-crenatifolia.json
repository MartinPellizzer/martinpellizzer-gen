    "intro": "Rhus crenatifolia, commonly known as the smooth sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and have serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in upright clusters, followed by red, fuzzy fruits that are a common food source for birds. Rhus crenatifolia thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in woodland edges, thickets, and disturbed areas. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a notable species in ecological restoration projects."
