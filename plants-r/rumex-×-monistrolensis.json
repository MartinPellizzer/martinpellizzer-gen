    "intro": "Rumex \u00d7 monistrolensis, commonly known as the hybrid sorrel, is a sterile hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Rumex acetosa (common sorrel) and Rumex acetobipinatus (broadleaf sorrel). It is characterized by its broad, arrow-shaped leaves that are typically reddish in color and covered with a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are borne on short, erect stalks. It is often found in moist, nutrient-rich soils in meadows and along stream banks. Due to its sterility, it does not produce viable seeds and is primarily propagated through vegetative means."
