    "intro": "Romulea setifolia var. ceresiana, commonly known as the Ceresian glory-of-the-snow, is a perennial bulbous plant native to southern Africa. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces showy, white to pale pink flowers in early spring. The plant is adapted to dry, rocky environments and thrives in full sun. Its bulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive periods of drought. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value in rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
