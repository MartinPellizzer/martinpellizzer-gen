It is characterized by its thorny stems, pinnately compound leaves, and fragrant pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, red, hairy fruits known as hips, which are typically consumed by birds and small mammals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to temperate to cold climates, often found in rocky or alpine environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological importance in its native habitat."
