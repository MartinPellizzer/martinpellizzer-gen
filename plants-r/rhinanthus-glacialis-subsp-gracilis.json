It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, characterized by its parasitic lifestyle, relying on host plants for nutrients. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to August. It thrives in open, disturbed habitats such as tundra and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
