It is native to the United States and thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil. The plant produces pink to white blooms that are highly aromatic, often used in perfumery and horticulture. Its vigorous growth habit makes it suitable for hedging or as a decorative shrub. However, it requires regular pruning to maintain its shape and prevent overgrowth."
