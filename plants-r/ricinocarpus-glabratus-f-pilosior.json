    "intro": "Ricinocarpus glabratus f. pilosior, commonly known as the hairy sea grape, is a variant of the sea grape plant native to tropical coastal regions. It is a flowering plant belonging to the family Arecaceae, characterized by its clustered, fleshy, fruit-like structures called drupes. The plant thrives in saline environments and is often found in mangrove swamps and tidal zones. Its leaves are typically broad and leathery, while the drupes are covered in a dense, hairy layer that distinguishes this form from the typical variety. This plant plays a role in coastal ecosystems by stabilizing sediments and providing habitat for marine life."
