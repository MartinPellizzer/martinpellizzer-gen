    "intro": "Rubus ulmifolius var. bouvetii, commonly known as the Bouveti blackberry, is a variant of the common blackberry native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its large, dark purple to black berries that are typically larger and more flavorful than those of the standard Rubus ulmifolius. The plant produces compound leaves with serrated edges and has thorny stems typical of the Rubus genus. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. This variety is valued for both its ornamental appeal and its edible fruits."
