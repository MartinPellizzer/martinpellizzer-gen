    "intro": "Rhynchospora wrightiana, commonly known as Wright's spike-rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and rushes, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish or brownish in color, arranged in spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Due to its ecological importance and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a valuable indicator species for wetland health."
