It is characterized by its upright growth habit and thorny stems, typical of many Rubus species. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red when ripe, making it a valuable crop for both ornamental and culinary purposes. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil. This variety is often cultivated for its edible fruits and its ability to form dense thickets."
