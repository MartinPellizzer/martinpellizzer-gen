It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces clusters of showy, white or pale pink flowers with a distinctive rostellum, a fleshy appendage at the base of each petal. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil. This variant is prized for its ornamental value in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
