    "intro": "Rumex \u00d7 trimenii, commonly known as the hybrid sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Polygonaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive arrow-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming in spring. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a persistent weed in cultivated areas. The leaves are edible but contain oxalic acid, which can be harmful in large quantities."
