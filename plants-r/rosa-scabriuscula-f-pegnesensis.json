    "intro": "Rosa scabriuscula f. pegnesensis, commonly known as the Pegnensian bristly rose, is a botanical variant of the bristly rose species. It is characterized by its hairy, rough-textured stems and leaves, which are adaptations to its native arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or red in color, adding ornamental value. It is native to regions in Central Asia, including parts of Kazakhstan and Mongolia. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphological features and ecological resilience."
