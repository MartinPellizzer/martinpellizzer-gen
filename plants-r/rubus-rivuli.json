    "intro": "Rubus rivuli, commonly known as the stream raspberry, is a species of bramble native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and produces small, edible berries that are typically red when mature. The plant has compound leaves with three to five leaflets, and its flowers are usually white or pale pink. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near streams or in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
