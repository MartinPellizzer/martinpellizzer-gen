It is a shrub that typically grows in wet meadows and along riverbanks, thriving in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are edible and have a tart flavor. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it has thorny stems typical of the Rubus genus. This variety is often found in riparian zones and is adapted to the specific ecological conditions of the Danube region."
