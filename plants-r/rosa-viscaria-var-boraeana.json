    "intro": "Rosa viscaria var. boraeana, commonly known as the Arctic rose, is a rare and hardy shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with dense clusters of small, white to pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has dark green, leathery leaves that are adapted to withstand cold temperatures and strong winds. Its stems are covered in fine, sticky hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in polar ecosystems."
