    "intro": "Razumovia longiflora, commonly known as the long-flowered razumovia, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of elongated, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pale pink to deep purple. The plant typically blooms in late summer, producing nectar-rich flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, silvery down, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Razumovia longiflora is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
