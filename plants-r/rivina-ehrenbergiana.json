    "intro": "Rivina ehrenbergiana, commonly known as the redroot false mallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring woody stems and lance-shaped leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its scientific name honors the German botanist Johann Friedrich von Rivina, and it is often found in rocky soils and arid environments. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
