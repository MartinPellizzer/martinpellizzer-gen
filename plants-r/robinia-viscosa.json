    "intro": "Robinia viscosa, commonly known as the yellow poplar or false acacia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged with oval, light green leaflets. The plant produces fragrant, yellowish-white flowers in racemes during the spring, followed by flat, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Its bark is rough and fissured, often exuding a sticky resin when damaged. Robinia viscosa is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in open woodlands and along stream banks."
