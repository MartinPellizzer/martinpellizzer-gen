It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically harvested in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates. Due to its hardy nature, it is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats."
