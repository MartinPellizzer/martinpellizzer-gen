    "intro": "Roegneria media, commonly known as the common wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous florets, which are wind-pollinated. Roegneria media is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in disturbed soils, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its fibrous root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it a valuable plant in ecological restoration projects."
