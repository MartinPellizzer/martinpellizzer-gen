    "intro": "Rhododendron puralbum, commonly known as the purpleleaf rhododendron, is a species native to eastern Asia, particularly China. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage that displays a striking purple hue, especially during the growing season. The plant produces showy, funnel-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to form compact, bushy growth habit."
