    "intro": "Rubus asservatus, commonly known as the dwarf blackberry, is a shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its small, thorny stems and clusters of tiny, white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, dark purple berries that are typically harvested in late summer. Rubus asservatus is often found in moist, shady environments such as forests and along stream banks. It plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing food for various wildlife species."
