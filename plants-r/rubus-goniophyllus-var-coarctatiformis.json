    "intro": "Rubus goniophyllus var. coarctatiformis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to certain regions of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, serrated leaves and small, dark purple to black berries. The plant typically grows in woodland areas and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Its flowers are white and clustered, producing a distinctive, aromatic fragrance. This variety is valued for both its ornamental appeal and its edible fruits, though it is less commonly cultivated than other blackberry species."
