    "intro": "Rubus tephrodes var. schindleri, commonly known as the Schindler's bramble, is a variant of the evergreen bramble native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces edible berries that are typically red or black in color, though they are often bitter and not widely consumed. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
