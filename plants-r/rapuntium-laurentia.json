    "intro": "Rapuntium laurentia, commonly known as the Laurentian rapunculus, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the colder regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features a basal rosette of lance-shaped, hairy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with four petals, typically blooming in early summer. Its root system consists of thick, fleshy tubers that store nutrients and help the plant survive harsh winter conditions. Rapuntium laurentia is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, making it a resilient plant in alpine and subalpine environments."
