    "intro": "Rhetinocarpha suffruticosa, commonly known as the desert holly, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, fleshy, spiny leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its fruit is a capsule that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Rhetinocarpha suffruticosa is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
