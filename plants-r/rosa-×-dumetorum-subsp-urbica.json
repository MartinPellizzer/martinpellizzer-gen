    "intro": "Rosa \u00d7 dumetorum subsp. urbica, commonly known as the urban rose, is a low-growing shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, thornless stems and clusters of small, fragrant white or pink flowers. The plant typically produces oval, hairy leaves with a serrated margin. It thrives in disturbed soils and urban environments, making it a common sight in gardens and along roadsides. Its hardy nature and ability to spread through stolons make it both ornamental and invasive in certain regions."
