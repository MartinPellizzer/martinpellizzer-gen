    "intro": "Rubus megethacanthus, commonly known as the coastal blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves, which are typically serrated and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that ripen to a dark purple or black color, often used in local foraging traditions. It thrives in coastal environments, preferring moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sun exposure. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
