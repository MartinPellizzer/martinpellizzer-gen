    "intro": "Racosperma dermatophyllum, commonly known as the silky glabrous acacia, is a shrub native to Australia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, compound leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in spikes, which are followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing seeds. It is typically found in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Racosperma dermatophyllum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for native wildlife."
