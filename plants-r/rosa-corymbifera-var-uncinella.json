    "intro": "Rosa corymbifera var. uncinella, commonly known as the hooked-leaved dog rose, is a deciduous shrub native to parts of Asia, particularly China. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, fragrant pink flowers that bloom in spring. The leaves are compound, typically with five to seven leaflets, and the undersides are often covered in fine hairs. This variety is notable for its distinctive hooked tips on the leaflets, which give it its specific epithet \"uncinella.\" It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine."
