    "intro": "Rumex multiflorus, commonly known as the many-flowered sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features a basal rosette of oval, wavy-edged leaves that are typically reddish or purple beneath. The plant produces dense clusters of small, greenish flowers in late spring, which are borne on tall, erect stems. Its leaves contain oxalic acid, giving them a tart, sour flavor. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas and along stream banks."
