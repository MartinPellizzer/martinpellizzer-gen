    "intro": "Rubus altipratensis, commonly known as the alpine blackberry, is a species of brambles native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and produces small, dark berries that are often edible. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, typically between 1,500 and 2,500 meters. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it produces white to pinkish flowers in the spring. This plant plays an important ecological role in alpine ecosystems by providing food for various wildlife species."
