    "intro": "Rubus nanulus, commonly known as the dwarf raspberry, is a small shrub native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its small, trailing stems and clusters of tiny, white flowers. The plant produces small, red berries that are typically edible but not widely cultivated for commercial use. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a serrated edge, typical of many Rubus species. Due to its compact size and ornamental value, it is sometimes grown in gardens as a decorative plant."
