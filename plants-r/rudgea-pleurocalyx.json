    "intro": "Rudgea pleurocalyx, commonly known as the pink-flowered rudgea, is a flowering plant native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is a shrub characterized by its woody stems and lance-shaped leaves with a smooth, glossy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for tropical gardens, though it requires well-drained soil and partial shade to thrive. Rudgea pleurocalyx is also valued for its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
