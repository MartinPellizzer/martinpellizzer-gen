    "intro": "Rubus horrefactus, commonly known as the devil's lily, is a species of bramble native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its prickly stems and dark, velvety leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in the spring. Its fruit, a red, juicy berry, is edible but often described as having a tart and somewhat bitter flavor. Due to its rugged habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive plant in the wild."
