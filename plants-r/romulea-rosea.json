    "intro": "Romulea rosea, commonly known as the Persian buttercup, is a perennial bulbous plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, often with a subtle pinkish tinge. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, rounded bulbs that store nutrients for the next growing season. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Romulea rosea is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to cultivate in temperate climates."
