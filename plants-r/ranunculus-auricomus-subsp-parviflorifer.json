It features delicate, trifoliate leaves with a hairy surface and bright yellow flowers with five to eight petals. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and thrives in woodland or meadow habitats. It blooms from late spring to early summer, producing showy, cup-shaped flowers. The subspecies is distinguished by its smaller flower size and more compact growth compared to the typical form of Ranunculus auricomus."
