It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants known for their distinctive leaf shapes and often colorful flowers. The plant is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, bright red flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps it withstand the harsh mountain climate.
