    "intro": "Roebuckiella lathamensis var. glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular roebuckiella, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of South Africa. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant features glandular hairs on its stems and leaves, which give it its specific variety name. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or semi-arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
