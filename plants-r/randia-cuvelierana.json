    "intro": "Randia cuvelierana, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a flowering plant belonging to the Rubiaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of the Americas and is characterized by its elliptical, dark green leaves with a velvety texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by round, red or orange berries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it can become a nuisance in certain ecosystems."
