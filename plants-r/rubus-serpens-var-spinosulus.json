    "intro": "Rubus serpens var. spinosulus, commonly known as the spiny blackberry, is a perennial shrub native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its thorny stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black when ripe. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodland edges and thickets. Due to its invasive tendencies, it can outcompete native vegetation in certain regions."
