It belongs to the Rubus genus within the Rosaceae family, characterized by its thorny stems and aggregate fruits. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically edible, though they may have a tart flavor. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil. Rubus sextus is often found in woodlands and along hedgerows, where it plays a role in supporting local biodiversity."
