    "intro": "Roegneria japonica, commonly known as Japanese false brome, is a perennial grass species native to East Asia. It features slender, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a fine texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear pale green to brownish flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Roegneria japonica is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to form dense, low-growing mats."
