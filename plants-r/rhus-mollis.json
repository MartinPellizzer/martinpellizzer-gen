    "intro": "Rhus mollis, commonly known as smooth sumac, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It features compound leaves with 15 to 31 pairs of oval, serrated leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are followed by red, fuzzy fruits that attract birds and other wildlife. Its roots are fibrous and can spread widely, making it a common weed in disturbed soils. Smooth sumac is often found in open woods, along roadsides, and in dry, sandy areas."
