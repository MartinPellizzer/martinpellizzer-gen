    "intro": "Rubus malacoides, commonly known as the blackberry lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its dark, almost black, crust-like thallus that adheres tightly to the surfaces it colonizes, such as tree bark or rocks. The lichen lacks true leaves, stems, or roots, instead forming a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a photosynthetic alga or cyanobacterium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in temperate regions. Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a relatively rare and specialized organism."
