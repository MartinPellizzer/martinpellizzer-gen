    "intro": "Rosa tomentosa subvar. longifrons, commonly known as the woolly rose or long-fruited shrub rose, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, grayish-white pubescence covering the stems and leaves, giving it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant pink flowers in spring, followed by elongated, woody fruits known as achenes. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy ornamental plant. Its botanical features make it suitable for both garden use and ecological restoration projects."
