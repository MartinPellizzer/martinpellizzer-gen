    "intro": "Rhamnus castaneifolia, commonly known as the Chinese buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in the spring, followed by orange-red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas. The bark and leaves have been used in traditional medicine for their astringent properties."
