    "intro": "Rubus piletostachys subf. calcicola, commonly known as the calcicola raspberry, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or black in color. The plant thrives in limestone soils and is adapted to low moisture conditions. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It plays a role in stabilizing soils in its native habitat and is of interest to botanists studying xerophytic adaptations."
