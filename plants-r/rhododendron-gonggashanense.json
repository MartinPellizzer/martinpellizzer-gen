    "intro": "Rhododendron gonggashanense, commonly known as the Gonggashan rhododendron, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and showy, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments at high altitudes, preferring acidic soil conditions. Its botanical features include leathery leaves and a compact growth habit, making it well adapted to its alpine habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
