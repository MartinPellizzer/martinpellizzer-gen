    "intro": "Rorippa aspera subsp. boissieri, commonly known as the woolly watercress, is a perennial aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist environments such as stream banks, marshes, and wet meadows. The plant has alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a woolly appearance. Its small, white flowers are arranged in clusters and bloom from late spring to early summer. The subspecies boissieri is distinguished by its more robust growth and dense foliage compared to the typical form of Rorippa aspera."
