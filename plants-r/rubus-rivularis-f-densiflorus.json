    "intro": "Rubus rivularis f. densiflorus, commonly known as the dense-flowered blackberry shrub, is a botanical variant of the species Rubus rivularis. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers, which appear in the early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the foliage often has a slightly hairy texture. The fruit, which develops in late summer, is a small, dark purple berry with a tart flavor."
