    "intro": "Rhamnus californica var. ursina, commonly known as the California coffeeberry, is a shrub native to the western United States. It belongs to the Rhamnaceae family and is characterized by its small, glossy leaves and clusters of red berries that resemble coffee beans. The plant typically grows in coastal scrub and chaparral habitats, preferring well-drained soils. Its berries are edible but have a tart, slightly bitter flavor, and the plant is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value. It also plays a role in supporting local wildlife, particularly birds, which feed on its berries."
