    "intro": "Rosa abietina f. nuda, commonly known as the naked alpine rose, is a unique flowering plant characterized by its simple, unbranched stems and reduced foliage. It is a horticultural form of Rosa abietina, native to the alpine regions of Europe, particularly in the Pyrenees and Alps. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink to white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It is well adapted to harsh mountain environments, thriving in poor, rocky soils and cold climates. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in specialized gardens."
