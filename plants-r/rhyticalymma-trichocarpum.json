    "intro": "Rhyticalymma trichocarpum, commonly known as the hairy fruit tree, is a species native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and distinctive, hairy fruit capsules. The leaves are typically elliptical with a leathery texture and a slightly serrated margin. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by the development of its unique, hairy seed pods. Due to its ornamental value and potential ecological benefits, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
