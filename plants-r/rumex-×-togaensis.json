    "intro": "Rumex \u00d7 togaensis, commonly known as the hybrid sorrel, is a naturally occurring hybrid between Rumex acetosa (common sorrel) and Rumex acetobipenis (broad-leaved sorrel). It is characterized by its distinctive broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often reddish in color. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is found in temperate regions of Europe. It produces small, greenish flowers arranged in dense clusters, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. Due to its hybrid origin, it exhibits a range of morphological variations depending on its geographic location."
