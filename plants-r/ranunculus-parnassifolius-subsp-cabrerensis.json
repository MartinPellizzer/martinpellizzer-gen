    "intro": "Ranunculus parnassifolius subsp. cabrerensis, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada buttercup, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, yellow flowers with 5 to 15 petals and palmate, deeply lobed leaves. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky soils at high elevations. Its flowers bloom in early spring, and the plant is adapted to cold climates with a short growing season. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in cooler regions."
