It typically grows to a height of about 2 to 3 meters, featuring dense, dark green foliage with a waxy, slightly pubescent surface. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by small, round, leathery fruits. Its leaves are often covered in a fine, silvery down, giving it its common name. Riedlea aleurodendron is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and resilience."
