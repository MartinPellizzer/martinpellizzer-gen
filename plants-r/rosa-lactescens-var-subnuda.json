    "intro": "Rosa lactescens var. subnuda, commonly known as the naked milk rose, is a rare and delicate species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its pale pink to white flowers, which bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant has thin, almost leafless stems and produces small, clustered leaves with a hairy texture. Its flowers emit a subtle, sweet fragrance, and it is adapted to thrive in cool, moist environments. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
