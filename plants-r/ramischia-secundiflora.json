    "intro": "Ramischia secundiflora, commonly known as the desert sunflower, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 centimeters, featuring woody stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces bright yellow flowers with ray florets, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It has adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through deep root systems and reduced leaf surface area. Ramischia secundiflora plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing nectar for pollinators."
