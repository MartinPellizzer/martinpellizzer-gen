    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus subsp. sundinii, commonly known as the golden crowfoot, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features bright yellow flowers with five to seven petals, often accompanied by distinctive leaflets that are deeply divided. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its flowers bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The subspecies sundinii is distinguished by its slightly smaller flowers and more compact growth compared to the typical form of R. auricomus."
