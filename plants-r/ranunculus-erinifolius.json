    "intro": "Ranunculus erinifolius, commonly known as the silky buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features delicate, bright yellow flowers with deeply lobed petals that resemble those of a buttercup. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are covered in a soft, silky hair, giving it its common name. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Ranunculus erinifolius is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats, where it blooms from late spring to early summer."
