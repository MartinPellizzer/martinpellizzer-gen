It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its reddish stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red when ripe. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and localized species within its native habitat."
