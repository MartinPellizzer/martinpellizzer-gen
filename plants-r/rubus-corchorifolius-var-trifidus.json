It is characterized by its trifid (three-lobed) leaves and small, dark purple to black berries. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and woodlands. It produces flowers with five petals and has a prickly stem covered in fine hairs. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and edible fruits, though it is less commonly cultivated than other blackberry species."
