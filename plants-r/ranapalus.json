    "intro": "Ranapalus, commonly known as the golden trumpet vine, is a striking flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Bignoniaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant yellow, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces long, pendulous clusters of blossoms, which attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and often have a rough texture. Ranapalus is typically grown as a climbing plant, requiring support structures to reach its full potential."
