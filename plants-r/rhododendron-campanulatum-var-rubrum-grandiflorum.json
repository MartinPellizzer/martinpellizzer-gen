    "intro": "Rhododendron campanulatum var. rubrum-grandiflorum, commonly known as the Red-flowered Campanulatum Rhododendron, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range from pink to deep red, often with a contrasting white or pale throat. The plant typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters, featuring dense, dark green foliage with a leathery texture. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period, which extends from late spring to early summer."
