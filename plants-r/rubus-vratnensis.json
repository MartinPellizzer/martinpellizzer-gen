    "intro": "Rubus vratnensis, commonly known as the Vratnensk raspberry, is a species of bramble native to Southeast Europe. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or orange in color. It thrives in moist, woodland habitats and is often found in the understory of temperate forests. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
