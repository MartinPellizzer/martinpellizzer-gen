    "intro": "Rhododendron basilicum, commonly known as the sweet azalea, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its showy clusters of pink to rose-colored flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has elliptic to ovate leaves that are typically dark green and glossy, providing a striking contrast to the vibrant floral display. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Rhododendron basilicum is also valued for its fragrant foliage, which emits a subtle, sweet scent."
