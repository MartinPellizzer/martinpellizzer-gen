    "intro": "Ruschia gravida, commonly known as the fireplant, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features dense, compact growth with fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a powdery coating. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements make it an attractive addition to arid landscapes."
