    "intro": "Ribes acerifolium, commonly known as the redcurrant bush, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which resemble those of maple trees, and its clusters of small, red berries that ripen in late summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it adaptable to a variety of garden environments. Its flowers are typically pink or white and appear in early spring, preceding the foliage. Ribes acerifolium is also valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
