    "intro": "Rosa cinnamomea var. marisstrandica, commonly known as the sea rose, is a rare and distinctive plant native to the coastal areas of southern Sweden. It is characterized by its pale pink to white flowers, which bloom in late summer and are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant has a compact growth habit with multiple stems and is adapted to sandy, coastal soils. Its leaves are oval-shaped with a slightly waxy surface, and the plant produces small, red berries that persist into winter. This variety is valued for its ornamental beauty and its ability to thrive in harsh, maritime environments."
