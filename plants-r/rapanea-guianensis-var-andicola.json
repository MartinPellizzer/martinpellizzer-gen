    "intro": "Rapanea guianensis var. andicola, commonly known as the Andean rapanea, is a shrub or small tree native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the family Lauraceae, which includes laurels, and is characterized by its aromatic leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats within cloud forests, where it thrives in cooler, humid climates. Its leaves are often leathery and have a distinctive, spicy scent, while its fruits are small berries that attract various bird species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
