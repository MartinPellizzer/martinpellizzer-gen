    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus subsp. binatus, commonly known as the two-leaved buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features delicate, yellow flowers with deeply lobed petals that resemble a cup, and its leaves are typically divided into two distinct lobes. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks. It is characterized by its short stem and basal leaves, which are often covered in fine hairs. The subspecies is distinguished by its unique leaf morphology compared to other ranunculus species."
