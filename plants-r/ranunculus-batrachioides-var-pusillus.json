    "intro": "Ranunculus batrachioides var. pusillus, commonly known as the dwarf water buttercup, is a small, aquatic or semi-aquatic flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in wet meadows, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and streams. The plant features delicate, yellowish-green flowers with five to seven sepals and no true petals. Its leaves are palmately divided, often with a waxy coating that helps repel water. It is considered a rare and sensitive indicator of clean, unpolluted water environments."
