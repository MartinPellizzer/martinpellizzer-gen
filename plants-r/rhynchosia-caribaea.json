    "intro": "Rhynchosia caribaea, commonly known as the Caribbean burr bean, is a leguminous plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and distinctive, spiny pods that contain small, yellowish seeds. The plant typically grows in disturbed areas, such as roadsides and forests edges, and is adapted to thrive in warm, humid climates. Its flowers are usually pale pink or white, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its association with rhizobia bacteria. Rhynchosia caribaea is also valued for its potential use in forage and soil improvement in agricultural settings."
