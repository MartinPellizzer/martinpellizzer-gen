    "intro": "Rubus sallei, commonly known as the Salisberry, is a species of bramble native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves, typical of the Rubus genus. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or black in color, which are edible and have a tart flavor. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in forested or rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and agroforestry systems."
