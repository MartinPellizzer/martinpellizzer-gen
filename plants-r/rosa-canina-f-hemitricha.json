    "intro": "Rosa canina f. hemitricha, commonly known as the bristly dog rose, is a botanical variant of the common dog rose. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which distinguish it from the typical form. The flowers are usually pink or white, with five petals and numerous stamens. This subspecies is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often growing in woodland areas and along hedgerows. Its fruit, known as a hip, is similar to that of the common dog rose but may have a slightly different texture and appearance."
