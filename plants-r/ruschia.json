    "intro": "Ruschia, commonly known as the \"ice plant\" or \"sun rose,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the Aizoaceae family. These plants are native to southern Africa and are characterized by their succulent leaves and vibrant, showy flowers. Ruschia species typically have a low-growing, mat-forming habit, making them ideal for rock gardens and dry landscapes. They are drought-tolerant and thrive in full sun, with some species blooming in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The flowers often appear in clusters and are followed by small, bead-like fruits."
