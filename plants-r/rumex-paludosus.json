    "intro": "Rumex paludosus, commonly known as swamp sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in Europe and Asia. It features a robust rhizomatous root system that allows it to thrive in waterlogged soils. The plant has alternate, heart-shaped leaves with a reddish midrib and serrated edges. It produces small, greenish flowers in clusters during late spring to early summer. Rumex paludosus is often found in marshes, fens, and along the edges of ponds, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
