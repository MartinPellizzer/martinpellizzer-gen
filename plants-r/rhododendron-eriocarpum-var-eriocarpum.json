    "intro": "Rhododendron eriocarpum var. eriocarpum, commonly known as the woolly alpine rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Asia, particularly in China and the Himalayas. It is characterized by its dense, fuzzy foliage and showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to white. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, thriving in cool, moist climates with well-drained soil. Its leaves are leathery and often covered in a fine, white pubescence, which helps protect it from harsh environmental conditions. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
