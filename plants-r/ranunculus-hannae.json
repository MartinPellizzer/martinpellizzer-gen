    "intro": "Ranunculus hannae, commonly known as the Hannae buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features delicate, palmately divided leaves and showy, yellow flowers with prominent black anthers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, preferring well-drained soils and full sun. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it is often found in high-altitude meadows. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ranunculus hannae is considered a rare and endangered species."
