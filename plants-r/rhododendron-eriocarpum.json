    "intro": "Rhododendron eriocarpum, commonly known as the woolly alpine rhododendron, is a species native to the high-altitude regions of Asia, including China, Nepal, and Bhutan. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that provides insulation against cold temperatures. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its flowers are usually pink to purple, appearing in clusters and blooming in late spring to early summer. Rhododendron eriocarpum thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in mountainous, forested areas."
