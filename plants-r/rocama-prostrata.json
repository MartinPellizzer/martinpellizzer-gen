    "intro": "Rocama prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate rock rose, is a low-growing, flowering plant native to arid and rocky regions of southern Africa. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in its harsh environment. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for drought-tolerant landscaping."
