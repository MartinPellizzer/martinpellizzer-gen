    "intro": "Rosa \u00d7 dumetorum var. brachtii, commonly known as the Bracht's shrub rose, is a hybrid species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, thorny growth habit and compact shrub form, often reaching heights of 1 to 2 meters. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink to white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are dark green, glossy, and arranged in odd-pinnate patterns, contributing to its ornamental appeal. This variety is valued for its hardiness and ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils."
