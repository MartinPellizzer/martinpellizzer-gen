    "intro": "Rubus discolor var. villicaulis, commonly known as the silverleaf raspberry, is a variant of the raspberry plant native to parts of North America. It is characterized by its silvery-white undersides on its leaves, which give it its distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, red berries that are typically less flavorful compared to other raspberry varieties. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
