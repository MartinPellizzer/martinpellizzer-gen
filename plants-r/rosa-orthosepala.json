    "intro": "Rosa orthosepala, commonly known as the alpine rose, is a species of flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has simple, alternate leaves with serrated margins, and its stems are covered in fine, soft hairs. Rosa orthosepala is typically found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
