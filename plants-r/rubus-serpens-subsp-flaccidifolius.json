    "intro": "Rubus serpens subsp. flaccidifolius, commonly known as the soft-leaved blackberry, is a shrub native to parts of Asia, particularly China. It is characterized by its slender, arching stems and small, trifoliate leaves that are typically pale green and somewhat leathery. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are usually dark purple to black when ripe. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
