    "intro": "Rhynchospora rigidula, commonly known as rigid flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Africa and Asia. It typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, often in swampy areas or along the edges of water bodies. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of white or pale green flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies. Rhynchospora rigidula is often found in disturbed or nutrient-rich soils, making it a common indicator of wetland environments."
