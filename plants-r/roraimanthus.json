    "intro": "Roraimanthus, commonly known as the Roraima tree, is a rare and unique plant native to the tepuis of South America. It is a type of flowering plant belonging to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its large, thick leaves and striking, showy flowers that bloom in various colors. It thrives in the nutrient-poor soils of the tepuis, adapting to the harsh environmental conditions. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, Roraimanthus is considered an important species for botanical research."
