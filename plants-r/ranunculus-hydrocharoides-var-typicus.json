    "intro": "Ranunculus hydrocharoides var. typicus, commonly known as the water crowfoot, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to freshwater habitats in Europe and Asia. It typically grows in shallow waters, such as ponds, streams, and wet meadows, where it forms dense clusters of floating or submerged leaves. The plant features small, bright yellow flowers with five petal-like sepals, which are often mistaken for true petals. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize the soil, contributing to water filtration and habitat creation for aquatic life. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in wetland ecosystems."
