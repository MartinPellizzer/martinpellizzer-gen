    "intro": "Rubus nemorensis var. magnifolius, commonly known as the giant blackberry, is a variant of the European bramble species. It is characterized by its large, dark purple to black fruits, which are typically larger than those of the standard Rubus nemorensis. The plant produces trifoliate leaves with serrated edges and has a robust, thorny growth habit. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland areas. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and role in local ecosystems."
