    "intro": "Rindera karabaghensis, commonly known as the Karabakh rindera, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Azerbaijan. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at elevations above 1,500 meters. Its leaves are pinnately divided, and it produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
