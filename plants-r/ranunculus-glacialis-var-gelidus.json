    "intro": "Ranunculus glacialis var. gelidus, commonly known as the glacier buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its bright yellow, cup-shaped flowers and trifoliate leaves. The plant thrives in cold, moist environments and is adapted to withstand harsh winter conditions. Its small, hairy stems and leaves help reduce water loss in freezing temperatures. It plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing nectar for pollinators during the short summer season."
