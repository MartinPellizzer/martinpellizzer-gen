    "intro": "Rubus demotus, commonly known as the dwarf blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the western United States. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring thorny stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, dark red berries that are edible but often considered less palatable than those of other Rubus species. Its flowers are white and clustered, and it thrives in woodland and scrub habitats. Botanically, Rubus demotus is characterized by its persistent leaves and the presence of stipules at the base of its leaflets."
