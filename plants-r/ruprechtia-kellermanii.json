    "intro": "Ruprechtia kellermanii, commonly known as the Kellerman's ruprechtia, is a rare and striking member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, fern-like, compound leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of its family. It is native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
