    "intro": "Rubus pseudoidaeus, commonly known as the blackberry bramble, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its thorny stems and aggregate fruits, which are typically dark purple to black when mature. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by the development of its edible berries. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodlands, hedgerows, and disturbed soils. The leaves are simple, alternate, and have a serrated edge, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
