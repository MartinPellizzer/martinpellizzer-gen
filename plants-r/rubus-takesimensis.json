    "intro": "Rubus takesimensis, commonly known as the Siberian raspberry, is a species of brambles native to the cold climates of Siberia and northern Russia. It is a deciduous shrub that produces small, edible berries similar to raspberries, though they are typically less sweet and more tart. The plant has woody stems covered in thorny projections, which are characteristic of many Rubus species. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three leaflets that are serrated along the edges. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and is often found in forested areas or along riverbanks."
