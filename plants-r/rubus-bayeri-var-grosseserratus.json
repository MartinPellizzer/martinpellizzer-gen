    "intro": "Rubus bayeri var. grosseserratus, commonly known as the bay ericaceous raspberry, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated margins. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or black when mature. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and somewhat obscure species within the Rubus genus."
