    "intro": "Rhipsalis rigida, commonly known as the rigid mistletoe, is a unique epiphytic plant native to South America. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its long, slender, and often branching stems. Unlike typical cacti, it lacks spines and has a more vine-like appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers, followed by red, fleshy fruits that are edible for some animals. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees in tropical and subtropical regions."
