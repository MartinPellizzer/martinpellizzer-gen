    "intro": "Rubus ulmifolius f. inermis, commonly known as the soft-fruited blackberry, is a cultivar of the brambles family characterized by its delicate, non-thorny stems. It produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically softer and less tart than those of other blackberry varieties. The plant is a deciduous shrub with trifoliate leaves that have a serrated edge and a slightly hairy texture. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for cultivation in temperate climates. This variety is often favored for its culinary use in jams and desserts due to its sweet flavor and tender fruit."
