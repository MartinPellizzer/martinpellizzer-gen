    "intro": "Rhynchosia bicolor, commonly known as the two-colored burr legume, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. It is characterized by its distinctive two-colored flowers, typically featuring a white base and a red or pink upper portion. The plant produces small, spiny pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals. Rhynchosia bicolor is a legume, meaning it belongs to the Fabaceae family, and it has the ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic bacteria in its root nodules. This plant is often used in traditional medicine and as a forage crop in some regions."
