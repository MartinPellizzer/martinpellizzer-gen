    "intro": "Rubia vera, commonly known as wild madder, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its upright, branched stems and lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its roots are rich in anthraquinone compounds, making it historically valuable in dye production and traditional medicine. Rubia vera thrives in woodland edges and disturbed soils, preferring partial shade to full sun."
