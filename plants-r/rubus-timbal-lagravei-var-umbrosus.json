    "intro": "Rubus timbal-lagravei var. umbrosus, commonly known as the shadowy bramble, is a variant of the Rubus genus native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, thorny growth habit and dark, glossy foliage that thrives in shaded, humid environments. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or black in color, which are adapted for dispersal by birds. Its botanical features include trifoliate leaves and inflorescences with multiple small flowers. This variant is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological adaptations and limited distribution."
