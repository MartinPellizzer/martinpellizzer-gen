    "intro": "Ruschia ampliata, commonly known as the broadleaf Ruschia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features fleshy, thick leaves that are typically green with red or purple hues, especially under sunlight. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, or red, which bloom in summer. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
