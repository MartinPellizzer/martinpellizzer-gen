    "intro": "Rumex aquaticus subsp. lipschitzii, commonly known as the water sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its broad, arrow-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typical of the Polygonaceae family. It thrives in shallow water or moist soils and is often found in marshes, along stream banks, and in damp meadows. Due to its preference for wet environments, it plays an important role in stabilizing soil and supporting aquatic ecosystems."
