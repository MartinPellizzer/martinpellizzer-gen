    "intro": "Ranunculus aragazii, commonly known as the Aragan mountain buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family, characterized by its showy, often brightly colored flowers. The plant typically features a basal rosette of leaves and produces solitary, cup-shaped flowers with numerous stamens. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
