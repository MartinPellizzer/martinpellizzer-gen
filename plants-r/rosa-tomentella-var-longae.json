    "intro": "Rosa tomentella var. longae, commonly known as the long-stemmed woolly rose, is a shrub-like species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly white tomentum covering the stems and leaves, which provides insulation against harsh climates. The flowers are typically pink to red, with five petals and numerous stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, often growing in rocky or alpine environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in cold, arid conditions."
