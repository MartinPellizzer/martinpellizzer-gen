    "intro": "Ricinus communis f. gilvus, commonly known as the golden castor plant, is a variant of the castor oil plant characterized by its striking golden to yellowish foliage. This ornamental form exhibits variegated leaves with a mix of green and yellow tones, making it visually appealing in gardens. The plant retains the typical structure of Ricinus communis, with palmate leaves and spiny stems, but its foliage is distinctly different. It is often cultivated for its aesthetic value rather than for its oil-producing seeds. The golden castor plant thrives in warm climates and requires well-drained soil and full sun for optimal growth."
