    "intro": "Reseda media var. microcarpa, commonly known as the small-fruited hedge mustard, is a low-growing annual plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters and features slender, branched stems covered in fine hairs. The leaves are lance-shaped, with a slightly toothed margin, and the flowers are small, yellow, and clustered in loose inflorescences. It produces small, rounded pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. This plant thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands, roadsides, and waste areas."
