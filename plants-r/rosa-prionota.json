    "intro": "Rosa prionota, commonly known as the sandhill crabapple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its rough, bark-like stems and clusters of small, white to pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, apple-like fruits that are typically red or orange, containing several seeds. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a slightly serrated margin. Rosa prionota thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks."
