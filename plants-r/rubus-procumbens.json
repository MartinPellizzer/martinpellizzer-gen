    "intro": "Rubus procumbens, commonly known as the creeping raspberry, is a species of bramble native to North America. It is characterized by its low-growing, sprawling stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, white to pink flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by red, edible berries. Its leaves are typically trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Rubus procumbens is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing food for wildlife."
