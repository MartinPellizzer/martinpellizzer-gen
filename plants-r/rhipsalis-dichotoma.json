It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its branching, leafless stems that are often adorned with clusters of small, deciduous leaves. The plant produces vibrant flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, typically blooming during the winter months. Its unique growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular houseplant. Rhipsalis dichotoma thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
