It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. The plant is adapted to rocky and arid environments, showcasing a compact growth form and hairy leaves to reduce water loss. Its flowers are typically small and white, arranged in clusters that attract pollinators such as bees and flies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
