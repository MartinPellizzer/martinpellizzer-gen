    "intro": "Rhaponticum ciliatum, commonly known as the Siberian cowpea, is a perennial plant native to the cold climates of Siberia and northern Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, heart-shaped leaves with hairy edges. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in summer, followed by spherical, hairy fruits containing numerous seeds. It is adapted to grow in poor soils and is often found in alpine and tundra environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as a forage plant for livestock."
