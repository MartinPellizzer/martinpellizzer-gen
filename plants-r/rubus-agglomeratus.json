    "intro": "Rubus agglomeratus, commonly known as the clustered blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, thorny growth habit and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits known as berries, which are typically dark purple to black in color when mature. These berries are edible, though they are often described as having a tart and slightly astringent flavor. Rubus agglomeratus thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
