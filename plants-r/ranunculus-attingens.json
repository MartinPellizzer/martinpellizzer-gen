    "intro": "Ranunculus attingens, commonly known as the coastal buttercup, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shorelines. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with five petals, often surrounded by a ring of white or yellow sepals. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a distinctive lobed structure that helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Ranunculus attingens is adapted to salt spray and strong winds, making it a resilient species in coastal ecosystems."
