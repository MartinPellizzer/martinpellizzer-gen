    "intro": "Ranunculus carolinianus, commonly known as the Carolina buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features showy, yellow flowers with five to seven sepals that resemble petals, and it typically blooms from late spring to early summer. The plant has a basal rosette of leaves that are palmately lobed and covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and it plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
