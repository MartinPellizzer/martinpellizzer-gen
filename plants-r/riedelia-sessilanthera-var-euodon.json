    "intro": "Riedelia sessilanthera var. euodon, commonly known as the red-flowered riedelia, is a rare and striking plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, pink to red flowers. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in mountainous forests. Its leaves are ovate and hairy, while its flowers are borne in clusters at the ends of the branches. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
