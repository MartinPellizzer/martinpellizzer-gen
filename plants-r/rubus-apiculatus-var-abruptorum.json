It is characterized by its erect, often spiny stems and trifoliate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically harvested in late summer. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, fertile ground. This variety is valued for its hardiness and ability to form dense thickets."
