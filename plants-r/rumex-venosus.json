    "intro": "Rumex venosus, commonly known as the veined sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features trifoliate leaves with a distinctive veining pattern and a tangy, sour taste due to its high oxalic acid content. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in loose clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its leaves are sometimes used in traditional cuisine, though they should be consumed in moderation due to their acidic nature."
