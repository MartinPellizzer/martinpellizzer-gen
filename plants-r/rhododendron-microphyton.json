    "intro": "Rhododendron microphyton, commonly known as the dwarf rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and dense clusters of bell-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in acidic, well-drained soils and thrives in partially shaded environments. Its compact size makes it suitable for rock gardens and as a ground cover in woodland settings. Rhododendron microphyton is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
