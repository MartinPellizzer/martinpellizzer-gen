It features delicate, yellow flowers with 5 to 15 petals, often surrounded by a ring of leaf-like sepals. The plant has finely hairy stems and leaves that are deeply lobed, giving it a distinctive, fern-like appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it a notable species in ecological studies and native plant gardens."
