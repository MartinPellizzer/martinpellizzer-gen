    "intro": "Rhus aromatica var. aromatica, commonly known as smooth sumac, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It features compound leaves with 15 to 31 leaflets that are oval and serrated, turning bright red in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in upright clusters, which are followed by red, fuzzy berries that attract birds. Its aromatic leaves and stems release a sharp scent when crushed, giving it its common name. Smooth sumac is often found in moist woodlands and thrives in partial to full sunlight."
