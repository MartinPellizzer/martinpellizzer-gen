    "intro": "Rosa canina subvar. senticosa, commonly known as the sticky rose, is a variant of the dog rose native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a sticky texture. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink, followed by red, hairy fruits called hips. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in hedgerows and woodland edges. This subvariety is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in herbal medicine."
