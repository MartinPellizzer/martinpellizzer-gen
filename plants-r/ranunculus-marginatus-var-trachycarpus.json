    "intro": "Ranunculus marginatus var. trachycarpus, commonly known as the rough-seeded buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features delicate, palmately divided leaves and bright yellow flowers with five petals. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Its distinctive feature is the rough, hairy texture of its fruiting structures, which give it its specific epithet *trachycarpus*. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and early spring bloom."
