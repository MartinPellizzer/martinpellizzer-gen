    "intro": "Rhus sorbifolia, commonly known as the smooth sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Anacardiaceae family, which includes other plants like poison ivy and mango. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and turn bright red in the fall. Its small, yellowish-green flowers are followed by red, fuzzy berries that are a food source for birds and small mammals. Rhus sorbifolia is often found in open woods, along stream banks, and in disturbed sites."
