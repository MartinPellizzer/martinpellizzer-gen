    "intro": "Rosa glauca var. coriifolia, commonly known as the silverleaf rose, is a compact shrub native to the eastern United States. It features narrow, coriaceous (leathery) leaves that are often tinged with a silvery-blue hue, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white to pale pink, typically blooming in spring. Its slow growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens or as a container plant. The foliage remains attractive throughout the growing season, adding ornamental value year-round."
