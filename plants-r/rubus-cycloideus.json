It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, dark red to black berries. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the flowers are usually white or pale pink. The berries are edible, though often tart, and are used in local cuisines and traditional medicine."
