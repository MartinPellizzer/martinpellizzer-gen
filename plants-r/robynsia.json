It is native to the tropical regions of the Americas, particularly Central and South America. The plants are characterized by their showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that come in a variety of colors, including red, yellow, and orange.

They are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated for their ability to thrive in humid, tropical climates."
