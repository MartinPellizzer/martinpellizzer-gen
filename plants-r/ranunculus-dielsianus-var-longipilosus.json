    "intro": "Ranunculus dielsianus var. longipilosus, commonly known as the long-hairy buttercup, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of Central America. It is characterized by its delicate, yellow flowers with five petals and a hairy stem that distinguishes it from other ranunculus species. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are palmately divided and covered in fine, soft hairs, contributing to its unique appearance. This variety is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements."
