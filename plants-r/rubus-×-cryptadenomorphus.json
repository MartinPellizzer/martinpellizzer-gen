    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 cryptadenomorphus, commonly known as the blackberry raspberry, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Rubus ursinus (the blackberry) and Rubus chamaemorus (the cloudberry). It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces aggregate fruits composed of small, drupe-like berries that range in color from yellow to red and eventually dark purple. These fruits are rich in antioxidants and are often used in culinary applications. Its botanical features make it a valuable plant in both ecological and agricultural contexts."
