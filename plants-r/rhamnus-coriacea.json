    "intro": "Rhamnus coriacea, commonly known as the rough-leaved buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its thick, ridged, and often grayish bark, which becomes more pronounced with age. The leaves are simple, alternate, and typically have a rough, leathery texture with a bluish-green hue on top and a lighter underside. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by dark blue, fleshy berries that are attractive to birds. The plant is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in woodland edges and scrub habitats."
