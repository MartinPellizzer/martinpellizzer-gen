    "intro": "Roemera, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance with pale green or white flowers. The plant typically grows on the bark of trees, thriving in shaded, moist environments with high humidity. Roemera has small, scale-like leaves and produces a single spike of flowers, making it a striking yet elusive species. Due to its habitat specificity and declining populations, it is considered endangered and requires careful conservation efforts."
