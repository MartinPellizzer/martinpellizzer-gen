    "intro": "Rosa agrestis var. lexnitzensis, commonly known as the Lexnitzensis shrub rose, is a rare and lesser-known species of wild rose native to Central Europe. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in late spring. The plant features thorny stems and dark green, serrated leaves, typical of many rose species. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial shade, often found in woodland edges or rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a botanical curiosity and a subject of interest for horticulturists and botanists."
