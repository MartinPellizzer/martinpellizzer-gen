It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its small, hairy leaves and distinctive two-seeded fruits. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. Its flowers are usually pale green or yellow, and it produces a fibrous, mat-like growth habit. Ricinocarpos digynus is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
