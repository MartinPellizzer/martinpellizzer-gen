    "intro": "Randia decemcostata, commonly known as the ten-costate randia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne in the axils of the leaves. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Randia decemcostata is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests or along stream banks."
