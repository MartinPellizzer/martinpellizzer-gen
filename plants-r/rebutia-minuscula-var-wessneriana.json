    "intro": "Rebutia minuscula var. wessneriana, commonly known as the Wessner's moon cactus, is a compact, low-growing cactus native to South America. It features a short, cylindrical stem with a distinctive greenish-gray color and is often used as a base for grafting other cactus species. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a subtle ornamental touch. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its compact size and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and container cultivation."
