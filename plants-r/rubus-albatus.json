    "intro": "Rubus albatus, commonly known as the white-bracted raspberry, is a species of bramble native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves and clusters of white to pale yellow flowers that appear in the spring. The plant produces small, edible fruits that are similar to raspberries but have a milder flavor. It thrives in moist, wooded areas and is often found in the understory of forests. Rubus albatus is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
