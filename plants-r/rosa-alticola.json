    "intro": "Rosa alticola, commonly known as the alpine rose, is a species of flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white. The plant thrives in cool, high-altitude environments and is adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss. Rosa alticola is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
