It is characterized by its distinctive silvery-white undersides on its leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically harvested in late summer. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges or shaded areas. The botanical features of this variety make it a subject of interest in both horticulture and ecological studies."
