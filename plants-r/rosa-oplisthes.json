    "intro": "Rosa oplisthes, commonly known as the alpine rose, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, pink to white flowers in the spring, which are followed by red or orange hips in the autumn. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and covered in fine hairs, adapted to withstand cold temperatures. Rosa oplisthes is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens with high elevation or in containers."
