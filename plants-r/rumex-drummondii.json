    "intro": "Rumex drummondii, commonly known as Drummond's sorrel, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It belongs to the Polygonaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and streambanks. It has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread vegetatively. Its leaves contain oxalic acid, which can be toxic if consumed in large quantities."
