    "intro": "Rosa \u00d7 polliniana var. arenivaga, commonly known as the sand rose, is a hybrid shrub native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and thorny stems, which help it survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces fragrant, pink to red flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a fine layer of whitish hairs, which reduce water loss. This variety is well adapted to sandy soils and can thrive with minimal water, making it a resilient plant in semi-desert climates."
