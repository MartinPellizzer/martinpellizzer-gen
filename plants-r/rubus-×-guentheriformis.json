It is a naturally occurring hybrid between Rubus ursinus (the blackberry) and Rubus  fruticosus (the bramble). The plant is characterized by its thorny stems, compound leaves, and aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black in color. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges or disturbed soils. The berries are edible, though they are generally more tart than those of pure species."
