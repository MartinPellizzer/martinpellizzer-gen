    "intro": "Rubus chrysophyllus, commonly known as the golden-leaf bramble, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is native to parts of Asia, particularly China, and is characterized by its distinctive golden-yellow leaves. The plant produces small, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in summer, followed by red or black berries. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
