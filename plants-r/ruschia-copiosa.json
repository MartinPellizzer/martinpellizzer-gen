    "intro": "Ruschia copiosa, commonly known as the coastal Ruschia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features fleshy, ribbed leaves that are typically blue-green in color, adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the warmer months. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for low-maintenance landscaping."
