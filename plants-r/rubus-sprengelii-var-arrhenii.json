    "intro": "Rubus sprengelii var. arrhenii, commonly known as the male raspberry, is a variant of the raspberry plant characterized by its male flowers. This plant is part of the Rosaceae family and is native to certain regions of Asia. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically pollinated by insects. The fruit, though not as commonly cultivated as the female variant, is edible and has a unique flavor. Its botanical significance lies in its role in the reproductive cycle of the raspberry species."
