    "intro": "Rapistrum virgatum, commonly known as sea rocket, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its prostrate or upright growth habit, with slender, branched stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early spring. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, adapting to saline and windy environments. Rapistrum virgatum is often found in salt marshes, dunes, and other coastal habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
