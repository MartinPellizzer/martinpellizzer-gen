    "intro": "Rhinanthus minor subvar. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy yellow rattle, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, characterized by its hemiparasitic nature, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients. The plant produces small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It typically grows in grassy areas, such as meadows and pastures, and is often found in disturbed soils. Its hairy stems and leaves are distinctive features that help identify the species."
