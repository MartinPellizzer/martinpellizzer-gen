    "intro": "Riedlea littoralis, commonly known as the coastal riedlea, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is a shrub that typically grows near the shoreline, where it thrives in sandy or rocky soils. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the rainy season. Its leaves are simple and elliptical, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss in salty environments. Riedlea littoralis plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for local wildlife."
