It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically smaller than those of the typical species. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits known as drupes, which are usually red or black in color. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils. This form is notable for its horticultural interest due to its unique foliage and adaptability."
