It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or black when mature. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in hedgerows and woodland edges. Due to its hardy nature, it is both ecologically significant and sometimes considered a weed."
