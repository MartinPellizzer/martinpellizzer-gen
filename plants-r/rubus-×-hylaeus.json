It is a shrub with thorny stems and compound leaves that are typically trifoliate. The plant produces dark purple to black berries that are larger and sweeter than those of its parent species. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its edible fruits. The botanical characteristics of Rubus \u00d7 hylaeus make it a valuable crop in both commercial and home gardening settings."
