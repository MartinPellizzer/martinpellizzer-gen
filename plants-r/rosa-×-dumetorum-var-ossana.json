    "intro": "Rosa \u00d7 dumetorum var. ossana, commonly known as the Alpine rose or Ossana's rose, is a hybrid shrub native to the Alps. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense foliage, often forming low, mat-like structures. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink to white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are dark green, leathery, and covered in fine hairs, which help it withstand cold and harsh mountain conditions. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in alpine gardens."
