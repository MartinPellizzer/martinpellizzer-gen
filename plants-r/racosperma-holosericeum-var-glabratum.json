    "intro": "Racosperma holosericeum var. glabratum, commonly known as the smooth-haired racosperma, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant typically grows in shrubland and woodland habitats, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. This variant is distinguished by its smooth, hairless stem and leaves, which set it apart from other varieties within the species."
