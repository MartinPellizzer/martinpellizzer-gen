    "intro": "Rubus bloxamii, commonly known as Bloxam's blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the mountainous regions of central China. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and produces small, dark red to black berries. The plant features compound leaves with serrated edges and produces white to pale pink flowers in the spring. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
