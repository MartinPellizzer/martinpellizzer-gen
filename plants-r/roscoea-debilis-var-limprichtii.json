    "intro": "Roscoea debilis var. limprichtii, commonly known as the Himalayan false banana, is a rhizomatous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Nepal and Bhutan. It belongs to the Zingiberaceae family, which includes ginger and turmeric, and is characterized by its ornamental, strap-like leaves. The plant produces striking, red-bracted inflorescences with pale yellow to orange flowers, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal and unique foliage. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species in horticulture."
