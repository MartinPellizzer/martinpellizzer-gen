    "intro": "Ritchiea pentaphylla, commonly known as the five-leaf cycad, is a unique cycad species native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of stiff, dark green, feather-like leaves. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of cycads. Its leaves are arranged in a rosette pattern, and it is notable for its slow growth rate and long lifespan. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ritchiea pentaphylla is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
