    "intro": "Rhododendron radians var. minahasae, commonly known as the Minahasa rhododendron, is a compact evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of Indonesia. It features dense, leathery leaves that are typically dark green with a slight pubescence. The plant produces clusters of showy, funnel-shaped flowers in shades of pink to red, which bloom in the spring. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soil and requires partial to full sunlight. Due to its ornamental value and limited natural range, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and specialty collections."
