    "intro": "Rhigozum obovatum, commonly known as the broad-leaf sandmat, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its woody stems and opposite, ovate to obovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are typically borne in the axils of the leaves. Its succulent leaves and stems allow it to store water, making it well adapted to arid environments. Rhigozum obovatum is often found in rocky soils and is a common component of desert scrub ecosystems."
