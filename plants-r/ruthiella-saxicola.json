    "intro": "Ruthiella saxicola, commonly known as the saxicolous ruthiella, is a rare and specialized plant species that thrives in rocky or calcareous soils. It is typically found in arid or semi-arid environments, where it has adapted to poor nutrient conditions. The plant exhibits a compact growth form with small, fleshy leaves that help conserve water. Its flowers are usually pale or greenish in color, which helps it blend with its rocky surroundings. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Ruthiella saxicola is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
