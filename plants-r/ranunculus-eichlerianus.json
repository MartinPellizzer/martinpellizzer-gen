    "intro": "Ranunculus eichlerianus, commonly known as the Eichler's buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features bright yellow flowers with deeply lobed petals, typically blooming in early spring. The plant has a short, rhizomatous root system and thrives in well-drained, moist soils. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss. It is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats, where it contributes to local biodiversity."
