    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus subsp. maurochlorus, commonly known as the golden crown flower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its showy, yellow-orange flowers with a distinctive crown-like pattern on the petals. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils and full sunlight. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. The subspecies is distinguished by its unique leaf coloration, which often exhibits a bluish-green hue due to the presence of a specific type of chlorophyll."
