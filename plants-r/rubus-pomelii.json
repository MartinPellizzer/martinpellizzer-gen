    "intro": "Rubus pomelii, commonly known as the wild blackberry or dewberry, is a species of brambles native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and thorny stems, which help it climb and spread across the ground. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black in color, with a sweet and tart flavor. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the flowers are white with five petals. Rubus pomelii plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing food for various wildlife species."
