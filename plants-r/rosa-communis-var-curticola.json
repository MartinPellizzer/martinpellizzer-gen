    "intro": "Rosa communis var. curticola, commonly known as the curlyleaf rose, is a compact, shrub-like species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features dense, thorny stems and small, dark green leaves that are slightly curled at the edges, giving it its distinctive appearance. The plant produces fragrant, pink to red flowers in late spring to early summer. It is well adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and hardiness. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is relatively rare in the wild and is primarily found in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
