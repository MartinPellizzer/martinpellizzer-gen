    "intro": "Rubus miostylus, commonly known as the New Zealand bramble, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is native to New Zealand and is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of white or pink flowers. The plant produces small, edible berries that are often used in jams and preserves. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forested areas and along stream banks. Due to its invasive growth habit, it can pose a challenge in ecological restoration projects."
