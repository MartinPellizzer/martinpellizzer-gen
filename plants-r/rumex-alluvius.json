    "intro": "Rumex alluvius, commonly known as water sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy areas. It features alternate, broadly ovate leaves with a distinctive reddish or purple coloration on the veins and undersides. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on slender stalks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and colonize moist soils effectively. Rumex alluvius is often found in temperate regions and is adapted to thrive in environments with high water content."
