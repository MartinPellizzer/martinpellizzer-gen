    "intro": "Roupala tomentosa, commonly known as the silky roupala, is a small evergreen shrub native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a soft, fluffy appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that appear in clusters during the spring. Its leaves are oval-shaped with a hairy texture, and the plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Roupala tomentosa thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade."
