    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 ablutus, commonly known as the blackberry bramble, is a hybrid species within the Rubus genus, characterized by its thorny stems and aggregate fruits. It is native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and thrives in a variety of soil types, though it prefers well-drained, loamy soils. The plant produces dark purple to black berries that are rich in antioxidants and often used in culinary applications. Botanically, it exhibits traits of both its parent species, Rubus fruticosus and Rubus ursinus, with a complex genetic makeup. Its growth habit is typically shrub-like, with dense foliage and a vigorous growth rate that makes it both a valuable crop and a potential weed."
