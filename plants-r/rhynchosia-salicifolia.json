    "intro": "Rhynchosia salicifolia, commonly known as the willowleaf cowpea, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It is a legume characterized by its slender, willow-like leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant produces small, kidney-shaped pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fallow fields. Rhynchosia salicifolia is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in agricultural systems."
