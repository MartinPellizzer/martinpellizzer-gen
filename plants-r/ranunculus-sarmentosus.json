    "intro": "Ranunculus sarmentosus, commonly known as the creeping buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features a creeping rhizome system that allows it to spread across the ground, forming dense mats. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with five to eleven petals, typically blooming in early spring. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a distinctive veiny structure, and it is often found in moist, disturbed soils. Ranunculus sarmentosus is also known for its toxic properties, containing protoanemonin, which can cause skin irritation."
