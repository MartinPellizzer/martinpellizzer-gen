    "intro": "Rhynchosia rigidula, commonly known as the rigid false pigeon pea, is a flowering plant native to Africa and parts of Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect, woody stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by elongated, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. Rhynchosia rigidula is often found in dry, open habitats and is sometimes used in traditional medicine. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it valuable for soil enrichment in agricultural settings."
