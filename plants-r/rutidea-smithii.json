    "intro": "Rutidea smithii, commonly known as the Smith's legume, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in scrub or chaparral habitats. Rutidea smithii has small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with root nodules. Its ornamental value and ecological significance make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
