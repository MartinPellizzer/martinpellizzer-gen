    "intro": "Rhus eburnea, commonly known as the whitebead tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, pale grey bark and dense, rounded crown of glossy, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by clusters of red, fleshy berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dune environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
