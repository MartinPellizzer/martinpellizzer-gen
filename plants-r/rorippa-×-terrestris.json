    "intro": "Rorippa \u00d7 terrestris, commonly known as the common yellow water-lily, is a hybrid aquatic plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds, ditches, and wet meadows. The plant has floating leaves that are oval-shaped with a waxy surface, and its flowers are bright yellow with four petals. It produces small, round fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by water. Rorippa \u00d7 terrestris is often considered an invasive species in non-native regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
