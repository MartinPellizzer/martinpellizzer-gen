    "intro": "Ranunculus pantothrix var. peucedanifolius, commonly known as the peucedanifolius ranunculus, is a rare and distinctive member of the Ranunculaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, palmate leaves and showy, yellow-centered flowers with prominent white petals. Native to specific regions in Europe, this variant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its foliage resembles that of the peucedanifolius plant, giving it its botanical name. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
