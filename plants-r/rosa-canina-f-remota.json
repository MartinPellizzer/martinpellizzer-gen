    "intro": "Rosa canina f. remota, commonly known as the remote dog rose, is a botanical variant of the dog rose, characterized by its distinctive floral and foliar features. It typically exhibits smaller, more elongated petals compared to the standard Rosa canina, with a pale pink to white coloration. The plant produces small, red-orange hips that are similar in appearance to those of the common dog rose but often have a slightly different texture. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges or disturbed soils. This subspecies is noted for its ornamental value and has been cultivated for its unique floral display."
