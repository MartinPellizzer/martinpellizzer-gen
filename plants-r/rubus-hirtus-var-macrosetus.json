    "intro": "Rubus hirtus var. macrosetus, commonly known as the rough raspberry, is a thorny shrub native to parts of North America. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its stout, hairy stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or orange when ripe. It thrives in woodland edges and disturbed soils, often forming dense thickets. Due to its prickly nature, it is sometimes considered a weed but also has historical uses in herbal medicine."
