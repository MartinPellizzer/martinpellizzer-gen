    "intro": "Rhamnus utilis var. hypochrysa, commonly known as the yellow-flowered buckthorn, is a shrub native to parts of eastern North America. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, which are followed by dark blue, berry-like fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or along stream banks. This variety is notable for its ornamental value and its role in supporting local wildlife."
