It features heart-shaped, smooth, and glossy leaves that resemble peach leaves, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of tubular, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple, often with contrasting white or yellow markings. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for gardeners in warm climates. Ruellia persicifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
