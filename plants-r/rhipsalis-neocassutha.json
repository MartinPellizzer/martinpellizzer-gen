    "intro": "Rhipsalis neocassutha, commonly known as the Christmas cactus, is a tropical epiphytic plant native to Brazil. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its trailing stems that produce clusters of fragrant, tubular flowers. The plant typically blooms during the holiday season, hence its common name. Its leaves are modified into spineless, fleshy structures that help store water. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
