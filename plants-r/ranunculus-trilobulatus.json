    "intro": "Ranunculus trilobulatus, commonly known as the three-lobed buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features delicate, bright yellow flowers with five to seven sepals that resemble petals, and its leaves are palmately divided into three to five lobes. The plant grows in rocky or alpine habitats and prefers well-drained soils. It is part of the Ranunculaceae family, known for its showy flowers and often toxic sap. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
