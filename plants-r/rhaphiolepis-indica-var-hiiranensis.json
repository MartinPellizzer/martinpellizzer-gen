    "intro": "Rhaphiolepis indica var. hiiranensis, commonly known as the Hiiranensis firethorn, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to Japan. It features glossy, dark green leaves that are oval in shape and emit a subtle fragrance. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries that persist into winter. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a hedge. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage, floral display, and winter berries."
