    "intro": "Rubia chinensis var. esquirolii, commonly known as the Chinese madder, is a flowering plant native to China and parts of Southeast Asia. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which bloom in the spring. Its roots contain a red dye used historically in textile production, and it thrives in moist, shady environments. This variety is closely related to other species in the Rubia genus, which are known for their medicinal and dyeing properties."
