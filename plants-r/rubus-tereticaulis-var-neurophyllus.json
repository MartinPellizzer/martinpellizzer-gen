    "intro": "Rubus tereticaulis var. neurophyllus, commonly known as the slender blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant characterized by its slender stems and distinctive leaf morphology. It is native to the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The leaves are typically narrow and have a unique venation pattern, which sets it apart from other Rubus species. Its flowers are small, white, and clustered in racemes, followed by edible, dark purple berries. This plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated for its fruit in home gardens."
