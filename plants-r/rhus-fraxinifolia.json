    "intro": "Rhus fraxinifolia, commonly known as smooth sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and have a smooth, glossy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by red, fuzzy fruit clusters that persist into the winter. Its root system is fibrous and helps prevent soil erosion, making it a valuable plant in ecological restoration. Rhus fraxinifolia is often found in open woodlands, along streambanks, and in disturbed sites."
