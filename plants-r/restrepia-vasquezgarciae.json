    "intro": "Restrepia vasquezgarciae, commonly known as the V\u00e1squez-Garc\u00eda restrepia, is a rare orchid species native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dark green, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, typically during the cooler months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, nutrient-rich soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered endangered and is of particular interest to botanists and conservationists."
