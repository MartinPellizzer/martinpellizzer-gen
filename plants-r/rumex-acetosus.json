    "intro": "Rumex acetosus, commonly known as sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its alternate, broadly triangular leaves with a distinctive reddish coloration on the veins. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in dense clusters during the spring and summer months. Sorrel is known for its sour taste due to the presence of oxalic acid in its leaves. It is often found in moist, fertile soils along stream banks and in woodland areas."
