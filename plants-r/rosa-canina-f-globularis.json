    "intro": "Rosa canina f. globularis, commonly known as the globular rose, is a botanical variant of the dog rose. It is characterized by its compact, rounded growth habit and smaller, more densely packed flowers compared to the typical Rosa canina. The plant produces red-orange hips that are typically smaller and more spherical than those of the standard species. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively hardy, thriving in a variety of soil types. This form is particularly valued in garden settings for its unique appearance and resilience."
