    "intro": "Rupicapnos ochracea, commonly known as the yellow-flowered rock rose, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its upright, shrub-like growth habit and its ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine layer of white, waxy hair, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Rupicapnos ochracea is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in harsh environments."
