    "intro": "Rhododendron brookeanum var. kinabaluense, commonly known as the Kinabalu rhododendron, is a rare and striking evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Borneo. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range in color from deep pink to crimson, often with a contrasting white throat. The plant typically grows at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist, and shaded environments. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, providing a striking contrast to its vibrant blossoms. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable species for botanical study and conservation efforts."
