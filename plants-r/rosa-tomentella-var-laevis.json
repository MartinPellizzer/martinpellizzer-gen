    "intro": "Rosa tomentella var. laevis, commonly known as the woolly rose or smooth woolly rose, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, grayish-white pubescence covering the stems and leaves, which gives it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces fragrant, pale pink to white flowers in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically alternate, ovate, and covered with fine, soft hairs. This variety is well adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions."
