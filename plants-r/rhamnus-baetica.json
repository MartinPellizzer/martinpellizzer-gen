    "intro": "Rhamnus baetica, commonly known as the Spanish buckthorn, is a shrub native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are usually dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, followed by black, egg-shaped berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in Mediterranean scrublands. Rhamnus baetica has historical uses in traditional medicine and is also valued for its ornamental qualities."
