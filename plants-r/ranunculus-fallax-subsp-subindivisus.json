    "intro": "Ranunculus fallax subsp. subindivisus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features delicate, yellow flowers with five petals and a hairy, glandular stem. The leaves are deeply lobed and have a distinctive, narrow shape, often with a waxy coating. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. This subspecies is characterized by its smaller size compared to other ranunculus species and its preference for cooler climates."
