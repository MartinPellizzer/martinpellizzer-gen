    "intro": "Remijia prismatostylis, commonly known as the prism-styled orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the wet tropical forests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its erect, slender stems and lanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers with a unique prism-like structure on its column, which is a distinguishing feature of the species. It blooms during the rainy season, typically from April to June, and requires high humidity and well-drained soil to thrive. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
