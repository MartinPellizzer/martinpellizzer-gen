    "intro": "Ranunculus aspromontanus, commonly known as the aspromontan water buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as stream sides and forest floors, where it forms dense, low-growing clumps. The plant features palmately divided leaves with a distinctive waxy coating, and its flowers are typically yellow with a deep green center. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in many areas."
