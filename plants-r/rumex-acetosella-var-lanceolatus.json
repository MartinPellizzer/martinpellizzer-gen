    "intro": "Rumex acetosella var. lanceolatus, commonly known as narrowleaf sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features basal leaves that are lanceolate in shape, with a smooth or slightly toothed margin. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands, woodland edges, and disturbed areas. Its leaves are edible but contain oxalic acid, which can be harmful in large quantities."
