It is characterized by its dense, thorny growth habit and dark green, leathery leaves that remain on the plant throughout the year. The plant produces small, dark purple berries that are typically harvested in late summer. It is native to coastal regions of California and thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a shrub in gardens and landscapes."
