    "intro": "Rhamnus pumila var. wulfenii, commonly known as the dwarf buckthorn, is a small shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. The plant features small, oval leaves that are usually covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Its flowers are clustered in short inflorescences and are followed by small, dark berries that serve as a food source for birds and other wildlife. This species is noted for its hardy nature and ability to survive in extreme climates."
