    "intro": "Rubus taronensis, commonly known as the Taronese bramble, is a species of flowering plant in the rose family, Rubiaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus, particularly in Georgia and Turkey. The plant is characterized by its thorny stems, trifoliate leaves, and small, aggregate fruits that develop from its flowers. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and partial shade. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
