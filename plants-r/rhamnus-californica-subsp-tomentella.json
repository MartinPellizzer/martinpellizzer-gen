It is characterized by its dense, grayish-white pubescent foliage, which gives it a distinctive, woolly appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by reddish-black berries in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal scrub and chaparral habitats. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
