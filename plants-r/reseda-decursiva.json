    "intro": "Reseda decursiva, commonly known as creeping reseda, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It typically forms dense mats of slender, branched stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread aggressively in disturbed soils. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months, which are followed by narrow, lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Due to its rapid growth and ability to colonize areas, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
