    "intro": "Rhynchospora globularis var. globularis, commonly known as the globular spike-rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its compact, globular inflorescence, which consists of tightly packed, spike-like clusters of tiny, greenish to brownish flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, often in marshes or along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are grass-like, narrow, and usually reddish or brownish in color, and they form a dense rosette at the base. The species is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
