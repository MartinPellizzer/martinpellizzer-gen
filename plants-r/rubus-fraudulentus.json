    "intro": "Rubus fraudulentus, commonly known as the false blackberry, is a shrub native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It belongs to the Rosaceae family, which includes other familiar plants like roses and strawberries. The plant produces small, edible berries that are often mistaken for true blackberries due to their similar appearance. Its leaves are typically trifoliate, with three leaflets that have serrated edges. The flowers are white or pale pink, and they bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
