    "intro": "Rhus schinoides, commonly known as staghorn sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and have serrated margins. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by red, fuzzy berries that attract birds and other wildlife. Its bark is thick and rugged, featuring a distinctive, horn-like texture on older stems. Rhus schinoides is often found in dry, open habitats such as fields and woodland edges."
