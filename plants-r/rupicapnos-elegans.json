    "intro": "Rupicapnos elegans, commonly known as the silverleaf honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It features slender, arching stems with a silvery-gray bark that becomes more pronounced with age. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in early spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds. Its leaves are elliptical, with a slightly serrated margin and a pale underside. Rupicapnos elegans is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in partial shade."
