    "intro": "Rhododendron parvifolium var. alpinum, commonly known as the alpine rhododendron, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It features dense, evergreen foliage with small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, pink to red flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its hardy nature, it is well adapted to cold climates and high elevations."
