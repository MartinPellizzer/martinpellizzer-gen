    "intro": "Rosa rubiginosa var. adei, commonly known as the Armenian rose, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and parts of Turkey. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and clusters of pale pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, reddish-orange fruits called hips, which are rich in vitamin C. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or alpine environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
