    "intro": "Rumex floridanus, commonly known as Florida sorrel, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It features upright, glaucous-stemmed foliage with heart-shaped leaves that have a slightly sour taste due to the presence of oxalic acid. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands, swamps, and along stream banks. Botanically, it belongs to the Polygonaceae family, which includes other familiar plants like buckwheat and sorrel."
