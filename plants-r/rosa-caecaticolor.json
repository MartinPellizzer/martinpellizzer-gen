    "intro": "Rosa caecaticolor, commonly known as the ghostly rose, is a rare and striking species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its pale, almost translucent pink petals that give it a ghostly appearance, hence its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are dark green and serrated, with a slightly hairy texture. Rosa caecaticolor is a low-growing shrub that thrives in cool, moist environments and is prized for its unique aesthetic and horticultural value."
