    "intro": "Rubus dumetorum var. gracilis, commonly known as the slender blackberry, is a species of bramble native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its thin, wiry stems and small, dark purple to black fruits. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and streambanks. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and its flowers are white with five petals. This variety is often confused with other Rubus species due to its similar appearance but can be distinguished by its slender growth habit and fruit color."
