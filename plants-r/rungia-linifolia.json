    "intro": "Rungia linifolia, commonly known as the velvetleaf or slender rungia, is a tropical shrub native to regions of Southeast Asia and the Pacific. It is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine, velvety hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in terminal spikes, followed by round, fleshy fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in subtropical gardens."
