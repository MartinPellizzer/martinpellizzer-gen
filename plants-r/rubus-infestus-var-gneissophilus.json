    "intro": "Rubus infestus var. gneissophilus, commonly known as the gneiss-loving raspberry, is a variant of the raspberry plant adapted to thrive in rocky, nutrient-poor soils. It is characterized by its dense, thorny growth habit and small, dark red berries that ripen in late summer. The plant's leaves are typically trifoliate, with serrated edges and a slightly hairy texture. It is often found in mountainous regions where it forms dense thickets along rocky outcrops. Due to its specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
