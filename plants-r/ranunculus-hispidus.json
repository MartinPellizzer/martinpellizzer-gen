    "intro": "Ranunculus hispidus, commonly known as the hairy buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features upright, branched stems covered in soft, glandular hairs, giving it a distinctive hairy appearance. The plant produces showy, yellow or orange flowers with five petal-like sepals, often mistaken for true petals. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three heart-shaped leaflets, and are typically hairy as well. Ranunculus hispidus thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks."
