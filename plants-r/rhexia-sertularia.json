It belongs to the family Onagraceae and is characterized by its showy, pink or red flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a tuberous root system, which gives it its common name, and it thrives in moist, acidic soils. Its leaves are opposite and lance-shaped, often with a reddish or purple tinge. Rhexia sertularia is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
