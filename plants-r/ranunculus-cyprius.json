The plant typically grows to a height of about 10\u201330 cm and blooms from late spring to early summer. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. The flowers are often used in floral arrangements due to their delicate appearance and short blooming period."
