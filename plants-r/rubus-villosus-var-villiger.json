It is characterized by its thorny stems and large, lobed leaves covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces aggregate fruits, known as drupes, which are typically dark purple to black when ripe. These fruits are often used in jams and pies due to their tart flavor. The species is well adapted to a variety of soil types and thrives in full sun to partial shade."
