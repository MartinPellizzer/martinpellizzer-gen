    "intro": "Racosperma continuum, commonly known as the narrow-leafed wattle, is a shrub native to Australia. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod fruits. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its yellow flowers are clustered in racemes, and it is often used in revegetation projects due to its hardiness. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
