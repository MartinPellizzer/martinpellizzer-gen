    "intro": "Rubus candicans subsp. thyrsanthus, commonly known as the silverleaf bramble, is a shrub native to parts of eastern North America. It is characterized by its silvery-white undersides on its leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible but often have a tart flavor. It thrives in woodland edges and moist soils, and it is known for its thorny stems. Botanically, it belongs to the Rosaceae family and is closely related to other bramble species."
