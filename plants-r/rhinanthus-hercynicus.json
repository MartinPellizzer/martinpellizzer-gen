    "intro": "Rhinanthus hercynicus, commonly known as the Hercynian tickseed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom from June to August, typically in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. It is native to Europe and parts of western Asia, and it thrives in well-drained soils. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
