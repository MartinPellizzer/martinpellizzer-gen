    "intro": "Rubus moluccanus var. maximus, commonly known as the large-fruited blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, dark purple to black berries that are typically larger than those of the standard Rubus moluccanus. The plant produces compound leaves with serrated edges and grows as an erect shrub, often reaching heights of up to 2 meters. Its flowers are white and clustered in umbels, and the fruit develops from the fertilized flowers. This variety is valued for its flavorful berries, which are used in culinary applications and traditional medicine."
