    "intro": "Rosa glaucodermis, commonly known as the alpine rose, is a species of flowering plant in the rose family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, including the Himalayas and the Tibetan Plateau. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit, hairy stems, and small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink. Its leaves are typically alternate and covered with a fine, whitish down, which helps reduce water loss in its high-altitude environment. Rosa glaucodermis is well adapted to cold climates and is often found growing in rocky or alpine meadows."
