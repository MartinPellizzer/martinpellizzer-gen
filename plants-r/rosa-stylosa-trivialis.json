    "intro": "Rosa stylosa trivialis, commonly known as the slender-stemmed rose, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is native to parts of Asia, particularly China, and is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and small, fragrant flowers. The plant produces pink to white flowers that bloom in spring, and its leaves are typically simple and alternate. Rosa stylosa trivialis is often found in woodland areas and along the edges of forests, where it thrives in partial shade. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is more commonly encountered in the wild."
