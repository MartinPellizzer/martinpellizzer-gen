    "intro": "Rorippa portoricensis subsp. portoricensis, commonly known as the Puerto Rican watercress, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic flowering plant native to the island of Puerto Rico. It typically grows in wetlands, stream margins, and other moist habitats, often forming dense mats on the surface of water or in damp soil. The plant has alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating, and it produces small, white flowers with four petals. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in nutrient-rich, freshwater environments. This subspecies is an important part of the local flora and plays a role in maintaining aquatic ecosystem balance."
