    "intro": "Rourea prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate rourea, is a low-growing shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving them a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom during the warmer months. Its stems are often prostrate, lying flat on the ground and rooting at the nodes, which helps it spread vegetatively. Rourea prostrata is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices."
