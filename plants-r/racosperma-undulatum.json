    "intro": "Racosperma undulatum, commonly known as the wavy-leaf acacia, is a shrub native to eastern Australia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves with a wavy or undulating margin. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense, spherical or cylindrical inflorescences. It is adapted to dry conditions and is often found in open woodlands and heathlands. The seeds are enclosed in pods and are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ecological role in soil stabilization and providing food for native fauna."
