    "intro": "Ruellia glutinosa, commonly known as sticky ruellia, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and Central America. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a sticky substance, which gives it its common name. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple, typically blooming in the summer months. Ruellia glutinosa is a perennial herb that thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
