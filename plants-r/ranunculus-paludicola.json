    "intro": "Ranunculus paludicola, commonly known as the marsh buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features delicate, yellow flowers with five petals and numerous stamens, typical of the Ranunculaceae family. The plant thrives in moist, often acidic soils and is often found in bogs, fens, and marshes. Its leaves are palmately divided, and it has a short, stout stem that supports its showy blooms. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator of undisturbed wetland ecosystems."
