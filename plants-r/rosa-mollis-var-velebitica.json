    "intro": "Rosa mollis var. velebitica, commonly known as the Velebit rose, is a shrub-like plant native to the Dinaric Alps, particularly in Croatia. It is characterized by its dense, thornless stems and clusters of fragrant, pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets with a soft, velvety texture. This variety is adapted to rocky and limestone soils, often growing in mountainous regions with high elevation. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its beauty and fragrance."
