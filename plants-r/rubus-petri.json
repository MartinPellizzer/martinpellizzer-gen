    "intro": "Rubus petri, commonly known as the Petri bramble, is a species of flowering plant in the rose family, Rubiaceae. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers. The plant produces edible berries that are typically red or black in color, though they may vary in hue depending on the maturity. Rubus petri is native to parts of Asia and is often found in woodland or shrubland habitats. It plays a role in supporting local wildlife, particularly birds and small mammals, by providing food and shelter."
