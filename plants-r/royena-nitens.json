    "intro": "Royena nitens, commonly known as the slender royal fern, is a striking evergreen fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It features a tall, slender stem with a dense crown of arching, pinnately divided fronds that are often a vibrant green. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, moist soil to flourish. Its fronds can grow up to 1.5 meters in length, adding a dramatic visual impact to gardens or indoor spaces. Royena nitens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for its unique foliage structure."
