    "intro": "Rosa canina f. tomentelliformis, commonly known as the woolly-fruited dog rose, is a botanical variant of the dog rose, characterized by its dense, woolly pubescence on the stems and leaves. It is native to southern Europe and is typically found in woodland edges and scrublands. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by bright orange-red hips in autumn. Its foliage is dark green and leathery, with a distinctive, fuzzy texture. This form is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
