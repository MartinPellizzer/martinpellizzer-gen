    "intro": "Rhynchospora pubera var. multispiculosa, commonly known as the hairy spike-rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its cylindrical, grass-like stems and dense clusters of small, pale green to brownish flowers. The plant typically grows in marshy areas, pond edges, and along streams, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its leaves are narrow, often hairy, and arranged in two rows along the stem. This variety is distinguished by its numerous spikelets, which give it a distinctive, spiky appearance."
