    "intro": "Rhagodia nutans var. parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved sandblow, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and pale yellow flowers. The leaves are small, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland regions of southern Australia. This variant is distinguished from the typical form by its reduced leaf size and specific floral characteristics."
