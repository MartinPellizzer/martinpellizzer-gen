    "intro": "Reaumuria squarrosa, commonly known as the sandthorn, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia and North America. It is characterized by its woody stems covered in white, woolly hairs that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for some wildlife. Its leaves are alternate and often have a waxy coating, adapted to minimize evaporation. Reaumuria squarrosa is well-suited to sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes or desert margins."
