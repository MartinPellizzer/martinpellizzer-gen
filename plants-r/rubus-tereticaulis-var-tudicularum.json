It produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black when mature. The plant has trifoliate leaves with serrated edges and is characterized by its persistent, woody stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. The berries are edible but can be quite tart, and the plant is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value."
