    "intro": "Rafnia pauciflora, commonly known as the sparse-flowered Rafnia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of Asia. It typically grows to a height of about 30-60 centimeters and features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along its stem. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters during the summer months, which are followed by spherical, dry fruits containing several seeds. Rafnia pauciflora is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable species for ecological studies and horticultural interest."
