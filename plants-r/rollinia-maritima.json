    "intro": "Rollinia maritima, commonly known as the sea almond, is a tropical shrub native to coastal regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and elliptical leaves with a glossy upper surface. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in branched inflorescences, followed by edible, fleshy fruits that are sweet and aromatic. Rollinia maritima thrives in sandy soils and is often found in dune environments, where it plays a role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
