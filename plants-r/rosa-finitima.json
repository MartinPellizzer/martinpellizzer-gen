    "intro": "Rosa finitima, commonly known as the \"extinct rose,\" is a species that has not been definitively identified in modern botanical records. It is often cited in historical texts and folklore, suggesting it may have been a rare or locally extinct plant. The plant is believed to have had characteristics similar to other rose species, with fragrant flowers and thorny stems. Due to its lack of confirmed existence, its botanical description remains speculative. Researchers continue to explore historical botanical sources in hopes of rediscovering or confirming its existence."
