    "intro": "Rubus trifidus, commonly known as the trifid blackberry, is a species of brambles native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its trifid (three-lobed) leaves and thorny stems, typical of the Rubus genus. The plant produces small, dark purple berries that are edible but often tart and less commonly cultivated than other blackberry varieties. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and thickets. Its botanical features make it a notable plant in ecological studies and native plant gardens."
