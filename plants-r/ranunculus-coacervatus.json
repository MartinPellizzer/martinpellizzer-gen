It features showy, yellow flowers with five to nine petals, often with a distinctive dark center. The plant has alternate, palmately compound leaves that are finely divided and covered in a soft, velvety texture. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Its botanical name reflects its clustered growth habit and its relation to the buttercup family."
