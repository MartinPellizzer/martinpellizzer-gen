    "intro": "Rosa funerea, commonly known as the funeral rose, is a species of flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its dark red to almost black flowers, which bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant has a shrub-like structure with thorny stems and dark green, serrated leaves. Its flowers emit a strong, sometimes unpleasant odor, which is thought to attract specific pollinators. Rosa funerea is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens despite its challenging growing requirements."
