    "intro": "Rubus plicatus var. macrander, commonly known as the large-fruited blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its large, dark purple to black berries that are typically sweeter and less tart than those of other Rubus species. The plant produces compound leaves with serrated edges and thorny stems typical of the Rubus genus. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight. The fruit is often used in jams, pies, and other culinary applications due to its rich flavor and high sugar content."
