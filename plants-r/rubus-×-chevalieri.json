    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 chevalieri, commonly known as the blackberry raspberry hybrid, is a deciduous shrub that belongs to the Rosaceae family. It is a naturally occurring hybrid between Rubus ursinus (blackberry) and Rubus idaeus (raspberry), resulting in a plant that exhibits traits of both parent species. The plant produces aggregate fruits that are typically dark red to black in color, with a firm texture and a sweet-tart flavor. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a genetic bridge between two economically important fruit species."
