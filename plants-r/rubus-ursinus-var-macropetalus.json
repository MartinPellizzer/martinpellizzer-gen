    "intro": "Rubus ursinus var. macropetalus, commonly known as the large-petaled blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its large, showy white to pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces edible berries that are typically smaller and more tart than those of common blackberries. Its leaves are trifoliate, with a serrated margin, and the plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun. It is often found in coastal scrub and chaparral habitats."
