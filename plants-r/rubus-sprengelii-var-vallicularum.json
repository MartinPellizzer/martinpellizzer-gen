    "intro": "Rubus sprengelii var. vallicularum, commonly known as the alpine raspberry, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, white to pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces edible berries that are typically red or black when mature, though they are often smaller than those of common raspberries. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, alpine climates. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
