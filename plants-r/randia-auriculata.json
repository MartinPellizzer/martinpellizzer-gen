    "intro": "Randia auriculata, commonly known as the ear-shaped randia, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, characterized by its opposite, elliptical leaves with a distinct auriculate base. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences, followed by red, berry-like fruits. Its botanical features make it a notable species in tropical horticulture and ecological studies. Randia auriculata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
