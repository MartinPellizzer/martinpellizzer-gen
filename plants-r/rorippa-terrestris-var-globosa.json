    "intro": "Rorippa terrestris var. globosa, commonly known as the globular watercress, is a small, aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to wetlands and marshy areas. It features clustered, rounded leaves that are typically bright green and slightly succulent, adapted to retain water. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize soil in wet environments. It is often found in shallow water or along the edges of ponds and streams."
