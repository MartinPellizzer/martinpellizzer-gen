    "intro": "Rosa levistyla f. pernteri, commonly known as the Pernter's rose, is a compact, shrub-like plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It features dense, thorny stems and small, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces fragrant, semi-double pink flowers with a distinctive, almost velvety texture. It is well adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, making it a hardy species suitable for alpine gardens. This variety is particularly valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in cooler climates."
