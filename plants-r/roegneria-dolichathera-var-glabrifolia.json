    "intro": "Roegneria dolichathera var. glabrifolia, commonly known as the smooth leaf wheatgrass, is a grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, linear leaves that are typically smooth and hairless. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to golden florets, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rocky or alpine environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
