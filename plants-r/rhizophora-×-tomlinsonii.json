    "intro": "Rhizophora \u00d7 tomlinsonii, commonly known as the mangrove apple or red mangrove hybrid, is a naturally occurring hybrid between *Rhizophora mucronata* and *Rhizophora stylosa*. It is characterized by its distinctive prop roots that help stabilize coastal soils and facilitate gas exchange in waterlogged environments. The plant produces small, red, fleshy fruits that are dispersed by water, aiding in its propagation along tidal shorelines. It thrives in brackish water conditions and is often found in mangrove ecosystems across Southeast Asia. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species."
