    "intro": "Ranunculus austroslovenicus, commonly known as the Slovenian buttercup, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Slovenia and Croatia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its showy, yellow flowers with five petals. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in alpine meadows and forest clearings. Its leaves are palmately divided, and it produces small, greenish fruits that contain numerous seeds. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and protected species in its native range."
