    "intro": "[WRONG START] Rosenia, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae. It is characterized by its evergreen shrubs or small trees, often with lance-shaped leaves and showy, fragrant flowers. The genus includes several species, such as Rosenia glabra and Rosenia retusa, which are native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. The flowers are typically white or pink, with five petals and numerous stamens, making them visually striking. The plant's wood is valued for its durability and aesthetic qualities, though it is also known for its ecological importance in its native habitats."
