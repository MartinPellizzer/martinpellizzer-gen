    "intro": "Rubus varvicensis, commonly known as the V\u00e4sternorrland bramble, is a species of flowering plant in the rose family, Rosaceae. It is native to northern Europe, particularly Sweden and Finland, and thrives in moist, woodland environments. The plant is characterized by its thorny stems, trifoliate leaves, and small, aggregate fruits that develop from its flowers. It plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and vulnerable plant in its native range."
