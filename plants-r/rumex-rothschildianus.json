    "intro": "Rumex rothschildianus, commonly known as Rothschild's dock, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
