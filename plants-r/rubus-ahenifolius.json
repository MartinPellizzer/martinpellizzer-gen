    "intro": "Rubus ahenifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaved blackberry, is a species of bramble native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with narrow, serrated leaflets. The plant produces small, aggregated fruits that are typically dark purple to black when ripe. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, loamy soils. Due to its hardy nature, it is often found in hedgerows, woodland edges, and disturbed areas."
