    "intro": "Ranunculus luzulifolius, commonly known as the alpine buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features showy, bright yellow flowers with five to eight petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its cold, high-altitude habitat. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and tundra environments. Due to its ornamental value, it is also cultivated in gardens, though it requires careful management to prevent it from becoming invasive."
