It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and elliptical, leathery leaves. The plant produces small, edible fruits that are yellowish-green and have a sweet, tangy flavor. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing on rocky soils. Due to its drought tolerance, it is sometimes used in xeriscaping and traditional medicine."
