    "intro": "Rubus finitimus, commonly known as the rare Himalayan blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are highly prized for their intense flavor and high antioxidant content. It thrives in cool, moist climates and requires well-drained, acidic soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
