    "intro": "Rosa canina f. conica, commonly known as the conical dog rose, is a botanical variant of the common dog rose. It is characterized by its distinctive conical or bottle-shaped hips, which are a notable feature in its morphology. The plant typically produces fragrant pink or white flowers in the spring, followed by the development of its unique fruiting structures. It is a deciduous shrub that thrives in temperate climates and is often found in hedgerows and woodland edges. This form is valued both for its ornamental qualities and its historical use in herbal medicine."
