It typically grows in shallow water, along the edges of ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. The plant features delicate, floating or submersed leaves that are usually trifoliate or palmately lobed. Its flowers are small, usually yellow or white, and bloom from late spring to early summer. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and small fish."
