    "intro": "Rivina viridis, commonly known as green ivy, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in the spring. It is often used as a ground cover or in hanging baskets due to its trailing growth habit. The plant is relatively drought-tolerant once established, making it a popular choice for landscaping in warm climates."
