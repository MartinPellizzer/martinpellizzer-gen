    "intro": "Rubus pergratus var. terrae-novae, commonly known as the Newfoundland raspberry, is a variant of the brambles native to the island of Newfoundland. It typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories and rocky slopes. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are red when mature, often used in local culinary traditions. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it has thorny stems typical of the Rubus genus. This variety is valued for both its ecological role and its historical significance in the region's flora."
