    "intro": "Rubus villicaulis var. polyacanthus, commonly known as the many-thorned blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to parts of eastern North America. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and clusters of small, dark purple to black berries. The leaves are typically trifoliate, with a serrated margin and a hairy surface. This plant thrives in woodland edges and moist soils, often forming thickets. Its berries are edible but have a tart flavor, making it a valuable plant for both wildlife and human consumption."
