    "intro": "Rhynchospora decurrens, commonly known as the creeping spike-rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and grass-like plants. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of pale green to brownish flowers. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, and its rhizomes help it spread vegetatively. Rhynchospora decurrens plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic insects."
