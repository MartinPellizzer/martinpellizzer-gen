    "intro": "Ranunculus rapaceus, commonly known as the alpine buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It features delicate, yellow flowers with five petals and numerous stamens, typical of the Ranunculaceae family. The plant has basal leaves that are palmately divided, and its stems are hairy and often reddish in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain environments."
