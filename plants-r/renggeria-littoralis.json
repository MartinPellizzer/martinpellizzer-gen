    "intro": "Renggeria littoralis, commonly known as the coastal renggeria, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom during the rainy season. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils near the shoreline, often growing in humid and saline environments. Its leaves are typically narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in coastal conditions. Renggeria littoralis plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various small organisms."
