    "intro": "Rosa rubiginosa plena, commonly known as the full-blown bristly rose, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and clusters of fragrant, double pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, red-orange hips that are rich in vitamin C and are used in culinary and medicinal applications. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy, drought-tolerant species. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its showy flowers and persistent foliage throughout the growing season."
