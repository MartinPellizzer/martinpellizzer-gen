    "intro": "Rapuntium cornutum, commonly known as the horned cabbageweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, spiny, horn-like structures on its leaves and stems, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland regions. Rapuntium cornutum is considered an invasive species in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation."
