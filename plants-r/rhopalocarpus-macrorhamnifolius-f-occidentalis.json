It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae, which includes plants known for their diverse morphological features. The plant is characterized by its large, glossy, ovate leaves that are often clustered at the base. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
