    "intro": "Rottboellia sibirica, commonly known as Siberian grass, is a perennial grass species native to the cold climates of Siberia and Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It is adapted to survive in harsh, arid conditions and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Rottboellia sibirica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in temperate regions."
