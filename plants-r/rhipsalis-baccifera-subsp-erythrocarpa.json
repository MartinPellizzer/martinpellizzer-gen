    "intro": "Rhipsalis baccifera subsp. erythrocarpa, commonly known as the red-fruited mistletoe cactus, is a species of epiphytic cactus native to parts of South America. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink, followed by bright red berries that are edible for some animals. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees in tropical rainforests. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant."
