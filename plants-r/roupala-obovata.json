It is characterized by its elliptical, dark green leaves that are often glabrous on the upper surface. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by woody, spherical fruits containing several seeds. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens."
