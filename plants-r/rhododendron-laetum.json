    "intro": "Rhododendron laetum, commonly known as the alpine rhododendron, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and showy clusters of pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, providing a striking contrast to the vibrant floral display. Rhododendron laetum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in cooler climates."
