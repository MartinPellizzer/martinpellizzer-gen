    "intro": "Rotang micracanthus, commonly known as the Malayan rosewood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood and is highly valued for its strength and durability. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland forests. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered a threatened species in its native habitat."
