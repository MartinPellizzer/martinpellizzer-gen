    "intro": "Rosa glauca f. diacantha, commonly known as the blue rose or the diacantha rose, is a unique form of the Rosa glauca species. It is characterized by its striking blue-pink flowers, which are more intensely colored than those of the typical Rosa glauca. This cultivar is a hybrid that exhibits a distinct coloration due to the presence of anthocyanins and other pigments. The plant is a shrub with thorny stems and dark green foliage, typical of many rose species. It is prized in horticulture for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
