    "intro": "Roepera retivalvis, commonly known as the glassy leaf orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its translucent, waxy leaves that give it its common name, and its small, pale green or white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Roepera retivalvis has a short flowering period, usually in late spring or early summer. Due to habitat loss and its limited distribution, it is considered a threatened species in many regions."
