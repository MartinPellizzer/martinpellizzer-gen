    "intro": "Roupala ochrantha, commonly known as the yellow roupala, is a deciduous shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in cyathia, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its fruits are capsules that release tiny seeds when mature, aiding in its dispersal. Roupala ochrantha is often used in traditional medicine and is valued for its ornamental qualities in gardens."
