    "intro": "Rubus platyphyllus, commonly known as the flat-leaf blackberry, is a species of bramble native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and thorny stems, which support its climbing nature. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically harvested in late summer. Its leaves are broad and have a distinctive flat appearance, which gives it its common name. Botanically, it belongs to the Rosaceae family and is closely related to other Rubus species."
