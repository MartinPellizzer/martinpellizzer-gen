    "intro": "Rodriguezia pygmaea, commonly known as the miniature rodriguezia, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America. It features dense, leathery foliage with elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. It is well adapted to humid, shaded environments and thrives in well-draining, nutrient-rich soil. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in tropical gardens."
