    "intro": "Rapicactus mandragora subsp. mandragora, commonly known as the ghost cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a low-growing, mat-forming cactus with pale green to blue-gray stems that are often covered in a white, waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits. Its unique appearance and ability to thrive in arid conditions make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. The subspecies is notable for its hardiness and adaptability to harsh desert environments."
