    "intro": "Rhodiola trifida, commonly known as the alpine rose or mountain rose, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of pink or white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments, often found in alpine meadows and rocky soils. Its leaves are typically basal, with a rosette-like structure that helps conserve moisture in harsh conditions. Rhodiola trifida is valued for its adaptability to extreme climates and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
