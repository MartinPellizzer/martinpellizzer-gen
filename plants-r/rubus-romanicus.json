    "intro": "Rubus romanicus, commonly known as the European blackberry, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves. The plant produces aggregate fruits, commonly referred to as blackberries, which are rich in antioxidants and have a sweet-tart flavor. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils. Rubus romanicus is valued both for its edible fruits and its role in ecological systems."
