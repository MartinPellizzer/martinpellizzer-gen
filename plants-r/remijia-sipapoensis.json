It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, frond-like structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, where it can thrive in high humidity. Its leaves are usually bipinnate, with a complex arrangement of pinnae and pinnules. Remijia sipapoensis plays a role in its ecosystem by contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
