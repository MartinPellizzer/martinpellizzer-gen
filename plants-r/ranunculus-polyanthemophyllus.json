It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family, characterized by its showy, often bright yellow flowers. The plant features compound leaves with lobed segments and produces numerous small, clustered flowers in spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens but is also threatened by habitat loss in the wild."
