It typically grows in moist or aquatic environments such as marshes, ponds, and stream banks. The plant features delicate, palmately divided leaves and yellow flowers with five petals. It is characterized by its short, hairy stems and is often found in shallow water or wet soil. Due to its preference for wet habitats, it plays a role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems and supporting insect life."
