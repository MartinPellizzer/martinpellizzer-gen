    "intro": "Rhododendron aurigeranum subsp. aurigeranum, commonly known as the Armenian rhododendron, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Armenia and Turkey. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in acidic, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, humid climates. It is often found in forested areas and along rocky slopes at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
