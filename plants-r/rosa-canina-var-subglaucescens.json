    "intro": "Rosa canina var. subglaucescens, commonly known as the pale rose or subglaucescent dog rose, is a variant of the common dog rose. It is characterized by its pale pink to white flowers and hairy stems, which distinguish it from the typical Rosa canina. The plant is a deciduous shrub with thorny stems and pinnately compound leaves. It produces rose hips that are typically smaller and less showy than those of the common dog rose. This variety is native to parts of Europe and is often found in woodlands and scrub habitats."
