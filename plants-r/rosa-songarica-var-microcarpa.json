It features fragrant, semi-double pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has dark green, ovate leaves with serrated edges and produces small, red-orange hips that are edible. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate foliage and persistent winter interest."
