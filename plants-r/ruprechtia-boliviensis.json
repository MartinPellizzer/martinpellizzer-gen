It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants such as buckwheat and sorrel. The plant is characterized by its upright growth habit, with lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs.

Ruprechtia boliviensis is adapted to thrive in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in high-altitude regions."
