    "intro": "Rosa canina f. sturensis, commonly known as the Sture rose, is a botanical variant of the dog rose. It is characterized by its pale pink to white flowers and thorny stems, typical of the Rosa canina species. The plant is native to parts of Europe and is often found in woodland edges and open habitats. Its foliage consists of pinnate leaves with serrated edges, and it produces red-orange hips that are rich in vitamin C. This form is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in hedgerows and landscape design."
