    "intro": "Rhaphiolepis brevipetiolata, commonly known as the Japanese rose or rosebay, is a deciduous shrub native to Japan and Korea. It features small, fragrant pink or white flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has glossy, ovate leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy on the underside. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for gardens and landscapes. Its ornamental value comes from both its showy flowers and its compact, bushy growth habit."
