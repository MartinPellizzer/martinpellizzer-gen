    "intro": "Rassia, commonly known as the African violet, is a popular flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the genus Saintpaulia and is characterized by its velvety, waxy leaves and showy, clustered flowers. The plant thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its compact growth habit makes it ideal for indoor cultivation, and it is often grown as a houseplant. Rassia is prized for its long blooming period and ability to produce vibrant flowers in a variety of colors."
