It is native to the cloud forests of southern Mexico, particularly in the state of Chiapas. The plant is characterized by its vibrant, showy flowers that come in shades of red, orange, and yellow. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
