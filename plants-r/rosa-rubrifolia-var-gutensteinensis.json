    "intro": "Rosa rubrifolia var. gutensteinensis, commonly known as the Gutenstein rose, is a rare and distinctive variant of the rubrifolia species. It is characterized by its striking red-veined foliage, which contrasts beautifully with its pale pink to white flowers. This plant is native to the mountainous regions of western North America, particularly in the Sierra Nevada and Cascade ranges. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
