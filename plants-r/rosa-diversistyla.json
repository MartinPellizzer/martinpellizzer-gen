    "intro": "Rosa diversistyla, commonly known as the alpine rose or mountain rose, is a species of flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of fragrant, pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets, and its stems are covered in fine, soft hairs. Rosa diversistyla is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
