    "intro": "Rauhiella ornata, commonly known as the golden star cactus, is a unique succulent native to the arid regions of South America. It features a compact, globular stem with a smooth, pale green surface that often has a slight waxy coating. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are clustered in a star-like pattern, giving it its common name. Its leaves are small, spineless, and arranged in a rosette formation, aiding in water retention. Rauhiella ornata is well-suited for rock gardens or containers due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
