    "intro": "Rubus marquesii, commonly known as the Marquesan raspberry, is a species of bramble native to the islands of French Polynesia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, aggregate fruits. The plant typically grows in coastal and lowland areas, thriving in humid, tropical climates. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are usually white or pale pink. The fruit, though not widely cultivated, is used locally for its tart flavor and is an important part of the region's biodiversity."
