It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that ripen to a dark purple or black color. It thrives in woodland areas and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its hardy nature, it is a common sight in natural habitats across its range."
