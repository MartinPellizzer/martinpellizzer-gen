    "intro": "Rousseauxia marojejensis subsp. marojejensis, commonly known as the Marojejy Rousseauxia, is a rare and endemic plant species native to Madagascar. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its woody stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. It thrives in the humid, shaded understory of primary rainforests, often found in the Marojejy National Park. Due to its restricted habitat and threats from habitat loss, it is considered critically endangered."
