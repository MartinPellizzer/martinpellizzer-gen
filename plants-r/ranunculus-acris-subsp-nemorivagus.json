    "intro": "Ranunculus acris subsp. nemorivagus, commonly known as the woodland buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and along stream banks, preferring well-drained, loamy soils. The plant features basal leaves that are palmately lobed and bright yellow flowers with five petals. It blooms from late spring to early summer, and its flowers are often visited by bees and other pollinators. The subspecies is characterized by its smaller, more delicate flowers compared to the typical form of Ranunculus acris."
