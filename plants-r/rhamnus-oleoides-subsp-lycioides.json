    "intro": "Rhamnus oleoides subsp. lycioides, commonly known as the desert buckthorn, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, dark green leaves and produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring. The plant is adapted to harsh environments, with deep roots that help it survive in dry conditions. Its fruits are small, reddish berries that are edible but often have a mild laxative effect. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils."
