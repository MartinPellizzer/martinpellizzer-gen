    "intro": "Rabelera cilicica, commonly known as the Cilician rabelera, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the eastern Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its evergreen shrub form, featuring small, leathery leaves that are typically arranged in a dense, compact manner. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom in the spring, often in shades of white or pale pink. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the arid and semi-arid climates of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change."
