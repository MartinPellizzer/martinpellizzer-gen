    "intro": "Rudbeckia moschata, commonly known as sweet coneflower, is a perennial plant native to North America. It is characterized by its showy yellow-orange ray flowers surrounding a central brown disk, which gives it a distinctive coneflower appearance. The plant typically grows to a height of 2 to 4 feet and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are hairy and sturdy. Rudbeckia moschata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
