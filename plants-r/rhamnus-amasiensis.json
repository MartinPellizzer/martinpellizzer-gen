    "intro": "Rhamnus amasiensis, commonly known as the Amasein buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to the Middle East and parts of southern Europe. It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on top and pale underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by small, fleshy berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in steppe and woodland habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and regionally endemic species."
