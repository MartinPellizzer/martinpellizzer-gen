    "intro": "Rubus repens, commonly known as trailing blackberry, is a low-growing shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It produces small, edible berries that are typically dark red to black in color. The plant has trailing stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it blooms with white or pale pink flowers in the spring. The plant is often found in woodland edges, hedgerows, and disturbed soils."
