    "intro": "Reseda, commonly known as cornflower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Caryophyllaceae. It is native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia, and includes several species such as Reseda luteola and Reseda alba. The plants are annual or perennial herbs with simple, often hairy stems and showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from yellow to red. The flowers are typically borne in clusters at the ends of the stems, and the leaves are alternate, ovate, and often covered in fine hairs. Reseda species are often found in disturbed soils and are valued for their ornamental appeal and historical use in dye production."
