    "intro": "Rosa murielae, commonly known as Muriel's rose, is a species of flowering plant in the rose family. It is native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America, specifically in Peru and Bolivia. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with serrated edges, and its stems are covered in stiff, thorny hairs. Rosa murielae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in alpine gardens due to its hardy nature."
