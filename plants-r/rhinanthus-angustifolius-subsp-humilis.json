    "intro": "Rhinanthus angustifolius subsp. humilis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved common tickseed, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, characterized by its hemiparasitic nature, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It produces small, yellow-orange flowers arranged in spikes, which attract various pollinators. Its leaves are narrow and linear, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
