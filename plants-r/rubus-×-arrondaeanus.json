It is a natural hybrid between Rubus ursinus (blackberry) and Rubus idaeus (raspberry), resulting in a plant that exhibits characteristics of both parents. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or black in color, with a tart flavor. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have serrated edges, while its stems are hairy and thorny. This hybrid is often cultivated for its unique fruit, which is used in culinary applications and jams."
