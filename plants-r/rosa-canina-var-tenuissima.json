It features delicate, thornless stems and small, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, red, hairy fruits called hips, which are often used in herbal remedies. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its fragrant blossoms and hardy nature."
