    "intro": "Rosa coriifolia var. entraunensis, commonly known as the Alpine shrub rose, is a compact, deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It features narrow, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine, silvery hairs, giving them a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink to white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its woody stems are covered in thorns, and it is well adapted to harsh, alpine conditions. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and resilience in rocky, well-drained soils."
