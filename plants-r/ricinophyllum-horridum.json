    "intro": "Ricinophyllum horridum, commonly known as the horrid thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and foliage with a rough, prickly texture. The plant features dark green, spiny leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern at the base. Its flowers are small, yellowish, and clustered in dense, spherical heads, typical of the daisy family. Ricinophyllum horridum is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments."
