    "intro": "Rosa villosa var. chenevardii, commonly known as the Chenevard's hairy rose, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It features thorny stems covered in a dense layer of grayish-white hairs, which give it its common name. The plant produces fragrant, pink to red flowers in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are compound, with five to seven oval leaflets that are hairy on both sides. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in woodland and garden settings."
