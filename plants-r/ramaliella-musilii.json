    "intro": "Ramaliella musilii, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its pale green, leafless stems and delicate, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in wet, pine rockland habitats and is often found growing on the trunks of trees, where it derives moisture and nutrients from the air. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of both botanical interest and conservation concern. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Ramaliella musilii is considered endangered and requires careful protection."
