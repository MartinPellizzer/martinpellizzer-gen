    "intro": "Rubus arduennensis microgene ripartii, commonly known as the Arduennian raspberry, is a rare and unique species of bramble native to the mountainous regions of the Ardennes. It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and dark red berries, which are similar to those of other Rubus species but with distinct genetic markers. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its leaves are serrated and have a slightly hairy texture, while its stems are thorny, typical of the Rubus genus. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
