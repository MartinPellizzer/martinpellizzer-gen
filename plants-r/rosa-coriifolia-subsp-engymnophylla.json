It is characterized by its slender, thornless stems and clusters of small, fragrant white or pink flowers. The plant has pinnately compound leaves with serrated edges and produces rose hips that are often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its botanical features make it distinct from other rose species, particularly in its leaf structure and floral display."
