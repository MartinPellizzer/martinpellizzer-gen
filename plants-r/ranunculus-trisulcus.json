    "intro": "Ranunculus trisulcus, commonly known as the three-lobed buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features delicate, yellow flowers with five to seven petals, typically arranged in a cup-like shape. The plant has trifoliate leaves, which are deeply lobed and often mistaken for those of other buttercup species. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in alpine meadows. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a member of the Ranunculaceae family, which includes many showy and sometimes toxic plants."
