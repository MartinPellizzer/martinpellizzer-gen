    "intro": "Rhinanthus \u00d7 zirnichii, commonly known as the hybrid common sandwort, is a flowering plant that results from the cross between Rhinanthus minor and Rhinanthus alectorolophus. It is a herbaceous annual or biennial plant characterized by its delicate, branched stems and small, yellowish-orange flowers. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and meadows. It has small, linear leaves and produces seeds in slender, hairy pods. Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits a range of morphological variations depending on the parent species involved."
