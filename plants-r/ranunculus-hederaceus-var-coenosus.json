It features bright yellow flowers with five to eight petals, typically blooming in early spring. The plant has a creeping growth habit, with stolons that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. Its leaves are trifoliate, with a rough texture, and it prefers moist, shaded environments. It is often found in woodland areas and along stream banks."
