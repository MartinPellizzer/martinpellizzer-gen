    "intro": "Rhododendron jinboense, commonly known as the Jinbo rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and showy, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant typically grows at elevations between 1,500 and 2,500 meters, where it thrives in cool, humid climates. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, providing a striking contrast to its vibrant floral displays. Rhododendron jinboense is often found in forest understories, where it forms dense thickets and plays a significant role in local ecosystems."
