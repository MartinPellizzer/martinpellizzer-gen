    "intro": "Rosa tomentosa var. ellipsoidea, commonly known as the woolly rose or elliptic-hair rose, is a shrub-like species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, grayish-white pubescent foliage and stems, which give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant pink or white flowers in the spring. Its leaves are typically oval to elliptic in shape, with a soft, velvety texture. This variety is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its attractive appearance and hardy nature."
