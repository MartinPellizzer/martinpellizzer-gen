    "intro": "Ricinus communis f. oligacanthus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf castor, is a botanical variant of the castor oil plant. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically shorter and more pointed than those of the typical castor plant. The plant produces distinctive spiky, crimson-red flower heads that are composed of numerous small, inconspicuous flowers. Its growth habit is similar to the standard castor plant, with a tall, upright stem and palmate leaves. This form is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in the production of castor oil."
