    "intro": "Rorippa teres, commonly known as the narrow-leaved watercress, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic flowering plant. It typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, often found near streams, ponds, and wet meadows. The plant has small, alternate leaves that are elongated and narrow, with a waxy surface to reduce water loss. Its flowers are yellow and borne in clusters, attracting various pollinators such as bees and flies. Rorippa teres is often used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported health benefits."
