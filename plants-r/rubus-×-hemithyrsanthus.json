It exhibits characteristics of both parent species, featuring dark red to black berries with a tangy, acidic flavor. The plant is a perennial shrub with thorny stems and trifoliate leaves, typically growing in temperate regions. Its flowers are white or pale pink, and it produces small, aggregate fruits that are prized for their unique taste. This hybrid is often cultivated for its ornamental value and culinary uses in jams and desserts."
