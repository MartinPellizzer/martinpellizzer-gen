    "intro": "Ruellia humifusa, commonly known as the creeping ruellia, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically blue or purple in color, blooming from spring to fall. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Ruellia humifusa is well-suited for use in ground covers and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
