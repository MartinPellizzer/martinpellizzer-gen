It is characterized by its prickly stems and compound leaves, typical of the Rubus genus. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are edible and have a tart flavor. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
