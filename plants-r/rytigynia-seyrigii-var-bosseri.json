    "intro": "Rytigynia seyrigii var. bosseri, commonly known as the Bosser's rytigynia, is a shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, fleshy berries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
