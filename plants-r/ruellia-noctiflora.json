It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are usually glossy and dark green. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that open at night, emitting a sweet fragrance to attract nocturnal pollinators. Its blooming period typically occurs in the summer months, and it thrives in well-drained soil with partial to full sunlight.
