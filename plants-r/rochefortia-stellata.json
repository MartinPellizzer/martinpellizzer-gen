    "intro": "Rochefortia stellata, commonly known as the star-leaf rochefortia, is a striking perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its showy, star-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features thick, fleshy leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to store water and thrive in arid conditions. Its roots are deep and fibrous, allowing it to survive in well-drained, sandy soils. Rochefortia stellata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and drought tolerance in xeriscaped gardens."
