    "intro": "Ranunculus dongrergensis var. altifidus, commonly known as the highland buttercup, is a rare alpine plant native to the Himalayas. It is characterized by its delicate, showy flowers with five petals, typically in shades of yellow or white. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments at high altitudes, often found in rocky or mountainous regions. Its leaves are deeply lobed and arranged in a basal rosette, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
