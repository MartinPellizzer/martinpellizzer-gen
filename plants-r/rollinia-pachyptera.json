    "intro": "Rollinia pachyptera, commonly known as the thick-leafed rollinia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Myrtaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its large, thick, glossy leaves. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in lowland rainforests. The fruit, which is a fleshy berry, is edible and has a sweet, slightly acidic flavor."
