    "intro": "Rhamnus pentaphylla, commonly known as the five-leafed buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically arranged in clusters of five. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in spring, followed by dark blue berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in gardens."
