It belongs to the Crassulaceae family and is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. Rhodiola maxima is adapted to cold climates and can thrive in high altitudes with limited soil nutrients. It is often used in traditional medicine for its purported adaptogenic properties."
