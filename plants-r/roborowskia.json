    "intro": "Roborowskia, commonly known as the \"rock spurge,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Euphorbiaceae. These plants are native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia, including parts of Russia and Kazakhstan. Roborowskia species are typically low-growing, mat-forming plants with fleshy, succulent leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. They are well adapted to harsh environments, often surviving in rocky or sandy soils with minimal water. The genus includes several species, some of which are cultivated for their ornamental value in rock gardens."
