    "intro": "Rhipsalis squamulosa, commonly known as the scaly mistletoe cactus, is a unique epiphytic plant native to Central and South America. It lacks the typical spines of other cacti and instead has soft, leaf-like structures called phylloclades that perform photosynthesis. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom during the rainy season, followed by small, red berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees in tropical forests. Due to its delicate appearance and specific care requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
