    "intro": "Rhamnus soporifera, commonly known as the sleepyleaf buckthorn, is a shrub native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are followed by dark, glossy berries. These berries are edible but contain toxic compounds, making them unsuitable for human consumption. The species is valued in traditional medicine for its purported sedative properties."
