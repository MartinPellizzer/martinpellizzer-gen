    "intro": "Rhamphospermum arvense, commonly known as the field lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in temperate regions. It forms a dense, carpet-like growth on soil surfaces, often found in open, disturbed habitats. The plant has a thallus composed of a symbiotic association between a green alga and a fungus. Its structure includes a central layer of fungal hyphae and a superficial layer of algal cells. Rhamphospermum arvense plays a role in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling in its ecosystem."
