    "intro": "Rauvolfia hirsuta var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth rauvolfia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is a climbing shrub that produces small, white or pinkish flowers and elongated, elliptical leaves. The plant is characterized by its smooth, glabrous stem and leaves, which distinguish it from its hairy counterpart, R. hirsuta. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The plant is notable for its medicinal properties, particularly due to the presence of alkaloids like reserpine."
