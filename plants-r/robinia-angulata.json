    "intro": "Robinia angulata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf false acacia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It features compound leaves that are pinnately arranged, with slender, angular leaflets that give it its common name. The plant produces fragrant, yellowish-white flowers in upright clusters during the spring, which are followed by long, cylindrical pods. It is adapted to well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and disturbed areas. Its botanical characteristics make it an important species in ecological restoration projects."
