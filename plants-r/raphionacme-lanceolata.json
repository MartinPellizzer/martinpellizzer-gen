    "intro": "Raphionacme lanceolata, commonly known as the narrowleaf raphionacme, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to greenish flowers that are clustered in umbels, a typical feature of the Apiaceae family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Raphionacme lanceolata is often found in rich, loamy soils and is an important component of early successional habitats."
