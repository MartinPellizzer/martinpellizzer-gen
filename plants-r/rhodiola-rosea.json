    "intro": "Rhodiola rosea, commonly known as the golden root, is a perennial plant native to cold climates of the Arctic, alpine regions, and mountainous areas. It belongs to the Crassulaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, rhizomatous root system and small, pink or red flowers. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor soils and can tolerate extreme environmental conditions, including frost and high altitudes. Its medicinal properties are attributed to the presence of secondary metabolites such as rosavins and salidrosides. Rhodiola rosea is widely used in traditional medicine for its adaptogenic and antioxidant effects."
