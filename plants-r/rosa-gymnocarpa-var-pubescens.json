    "intro": "Rosa gymnocarpa var. pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent rose, is a deciduous shrub native to China. It is characterized by its thorny stems and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in the spring. The leaves are pinnately compound, with hairy surfaces that give the plant its varietal name. The fruit is a red, fuzzy rose hip that develops after flowering. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its fragrance and visual interest."
