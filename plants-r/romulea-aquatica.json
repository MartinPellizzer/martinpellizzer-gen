    "intro": "Romulea aquatica, commonly known as the water romulea, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It thrives in wetland environments and is characterized by its rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces striking yellow flowers with a distinctive hooded shape, typically blooming in spring. It has a fibrous root system adapted to aquatic conditions, allowing it to anchor in muddy or sandy substrates. Romulea aquatica is often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of streams."
