    "intro": "Rubus idaeus var. aculeatissimus, commonly known as the brambles or blackberry bush, is a thorny shrub native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features compound leaves with serrated edges and produces aggregate fruits composed of small, drupe-like berries. The plant is characterized by its dense, prickly growth habit and is often found in woodland edges, hedgerows, and disturbed soils. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, and the fruit ripens in late summer. This variety is closely related to the common blackberry and is valued for its edible fruits and ecological importance."
