    "intro": "Rhododendron asperulum, commonly known as the roughleaf azalea, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of East Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage that is typically gray-green in color and covered with fine, stiff hairs. The plant produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and bloom in early spring. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is often cultivated in horticulture and conservation efforts."
