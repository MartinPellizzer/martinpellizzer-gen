    "intro": "Roegneria aristiglumis, commonly known as the slender false brome, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing pale green to reddish flowers, which bloom in late summer. Roegneria aristiglumis thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Its botanical features make it an important component of high-elevation ecosystems."
