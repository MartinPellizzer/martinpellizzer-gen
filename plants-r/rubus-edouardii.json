    "intro": "Rubus edouardii, commonly known as the Edouard's blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves, typical of the Rubus genus. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are edible but often have a tart flavor. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
