    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus var. fallax, commonly known as the fallax buttercup, is a variant of the auricomus buttercup, characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers with large, white-petaled centers. It is native to the mountainous regions of Europe, particularly in the Alps, where it thrives in moist, calcareous soils. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and the plant is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along streams. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain environments."
