    "intro": "Rhododendron uliginosum, commonly known as the swamp rhododendron, is a deciduous shrub native to the wetlands of eastern North America. It is characterized by its clusters of showy, pink to reddish-purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in acidic, peaty soils and is often found in bogs and swamps where moisture levels are consistently high. Its leaves are typically elliptical and dark green, providing a striking contrast to its vibrant floral display. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it plays an important role in the ecological balance of wetland ecosystems."
