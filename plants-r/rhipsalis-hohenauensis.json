    "intro": "Rhipsalis hohenauensis, commonly known as the Hohenau's mistletoe cactus, is a rare epiphytic cactus native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers during the wet season, followed by small, fleshy fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
