    "intro": "Rubus tephrocladus, commonly known as the snowberry raspberry, is a shrub native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its woody stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by red or orange berries. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
