    "intro": "Rumex \u00d7 danseri, commonly known as the hybrid sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Polygonaceae family. It is a naturally occurring hybrid between Rumex acetosa (common sorrel) and Rumex acetobulus (broad-leaved sorrel). The plant typically features heart-shaped leaves with a reddish or purple underside, and it produces small, greenish flowers in dense clusters. It is often found in moist soils along stream banks and in wet meadows. The plant is valued for its edible leaves, which have a tangy, sour flavor similar to other sorrel species."
