    "intro": "Rumex cyprius var. geminatus, commonly known as the Cyprus sorrel, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive reddish tinge on the underside, which becomes more pronounced as the plant matures. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in early spring. Its roots are rhizomatous, allowing it to spread vegetatively and form dense colonies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and stream banks."
