    "intro": "Roegneria transiliensis, commonly known as the Transilian grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Eastern Europe. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, bluish-green leaves that are typically arranged in dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, which are wind-pollinated. Roegneria transiliensis is often found in moist, well-drained soils in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its ecological role includes stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
