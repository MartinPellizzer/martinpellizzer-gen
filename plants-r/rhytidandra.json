    "intro": "Rhytidandra, commonly known as the African sandmat, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Cucurbitaceae. These plants are native to Africa and are characterized by their distinctive, sandpaper-like leaves that give them their common name. Rhytidandra species are typically shrubs or small trees, often found in arid or semi-arid environments. They produce small, yellowish flowers that are followed by round, fleshy fruits. The genus is notable for its ecological adaptations to harsh climates and its potential use in traditional medicine."
