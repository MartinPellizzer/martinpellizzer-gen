    "intro": "Rulingia cygnorum, commonly known as the swan tree, is a unique and rare plant native to the high Andes of South America. It is characterized by its striking, umbrella-like crown of long, white, silky leaves that give it an ethereal appearance. The plant is adapted to high-altitude environments, thriving in cool, moist climates with well-drained soil. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically greenish-yellow, and it produces distinctive, fleshy, red berries that are edible for some animals. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Rulingia cygnorum is considered a vulnerable species."
