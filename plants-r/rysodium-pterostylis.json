    "intro": "Rysodium pterostylis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the rainforests of northeastern Australia. It is characterized by its delicate, white, orchid-like flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant is an epiphyte, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its unique botanical features include a slender, leafless stem and small, elongated leaves. Due to its habitat specificity and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species."
