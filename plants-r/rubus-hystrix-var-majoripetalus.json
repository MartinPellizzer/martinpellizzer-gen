    "intro": "Rubus hystrix var. majoripetalus, commonly known as the giant thimbleberry, is a variant of the thimbleberry species native to parts of North America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically have five or more petals, which distinguishes it from the typical three-petaled form of R. hystrix. The plant produces edible berries that are similar in taste to regular raspberries but are often larger and more robust. Its leaves are compound, with three to five leaflets, and are covered in fine, prickly hairs. This variant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
