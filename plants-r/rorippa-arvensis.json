    "intro": "Rorippa arvensis, commonly known as common watercress, is a flowering plant in the Brassicaceae family. It is an aquatic or semi-aquatic perennial that typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of streams and rivers. The plant has alternate, broadly ovate leaves that are often submerged or floating, with small white flowers that appear in clusters. Its root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion in aquatic environments. It is also known for its peppery taste and has been used in traditional herbal medicine."
