    "intro": "Romulea ligustica var. rouyana, commonly known as the Rouyana gladiolus, is a striking bulbous perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features showy, spurred flowers that are typically pink or purple, resembling those of the gladiolus. The plant produces narrow, grass-like leaves and has a corm-like structure that stores nutrients. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long bloom period, which extends from late spring to early summer."
