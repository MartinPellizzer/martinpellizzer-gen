    "intro": "Rhododendron stewartianum, commonly known as Stewart's rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia, particularly in China, India, and Myanmar. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring dense, leathery leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are typically pink or red, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its botanical characteristics include a woody stem, opposite leaf arrangement, and a preference for acidic, well-drained soils. It is often found in moist, shaded forest environments, where it plays a role in the local ecosystem."
