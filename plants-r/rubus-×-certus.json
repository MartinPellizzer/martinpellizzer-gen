    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 certus, commonly known as the blackberry raspberry hybrid, is a deciduous shrub belonging to the Rosaceae family. It is a natural hybrid between Rubus ursinus (blackberry) and Rubus chamaemorus (cloudberry), resulting in a plant with unique botanical characteristics. The plant typically grows in temperate regions, preferring moist, well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it produces small, aggregate fruits that are a mix of blackberry and raspberry flavors. This hybrid is valued for its ornamental appeal and edible fruits, though it can be somewhat invasive in certain environments."
