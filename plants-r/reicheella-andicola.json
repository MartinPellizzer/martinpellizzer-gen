    "intro": "Reicheella andicola, commonly known as the Andean orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, sympodial growth habit. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, often arranged in dense clusters. It thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained, acidic soils. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species."
