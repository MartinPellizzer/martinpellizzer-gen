It is characterized by its pale yellow to white berries, which are distinct from the typical dark berries of other Rubus species. The plant produces thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. Its flowers are small, white, and clustered in groups of five. This variety is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks."
