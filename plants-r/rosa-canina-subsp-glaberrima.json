    "intro": "Rosa canina subsp. glaberrima, commonly known as the smooth hips rose, is a subspecies of the dog rose native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous fruits, which contrast with the typically hairy fruits of the main species, Rosa canina. The plant produces fragrant pink to white flowers in spring, followed by orange-red hips in autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and scrublands. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental qualities and has historical uses in herbal medicine."
