    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus subsp. snaeckstavikensis, commonly known as the Snaeckstavik buttercup, is a rare and distinctive subspecies of the buttercup family. It is characterized by its large, bright yellow petals that are typically more than twice the size of the sepals. The plant produces a single flower per stem, with a hairy, glandular stem and leaves that are deeply divided into three parts. It is native to the Arctic and subarctic regions, particularly in coastal areas of northern Scandinavia and Iceland. This subspecies is adapted to harsh, cold environments and is often found growing in rocky or sandy soils."
