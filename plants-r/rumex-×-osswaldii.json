    "intro": "Rumex \u00d7 osswaldii, commonly known as the hybrid sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Polygonaceae family. It is a natural hybrid between Rumex acetosa (common sorrel) and Rumex acetobulus (broad-leaved sorrel), resulting in a plant with distinctive characteristics from both parents. The leaves are typically heart-shaped, with a reddish or purple coloration on the veins, and the plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Due to its hybrid nature, Rumex \u00d7 osswaldii exhibits variability in morphology and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
