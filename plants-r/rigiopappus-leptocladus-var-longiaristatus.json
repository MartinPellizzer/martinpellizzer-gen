    "intro": "Rigiopappus leptocladus var. longiaristatus, commonly known as the long-leafed rigiopappus, is a rare and specialized plant species characterized by its elongated, narrow leaves and unique floral structure. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is known for its composite flower heads, and exhibits a distinctive arrangement of bracts and florets. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in mountainous regions with well-drained soil. Its leaves are usually lanceolate and covered in fine hairs, while its inflorescence consists of a central disc surrounded by ray florets. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
