    "intro": "Rumex \u00d7 weberi, commonly known as the hybrid sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Polygonaceae family. It is a naturally occurring hybrid between Rumex acetosa (common sorrel) and Rumex acetobursa (broad-leaf sorrel). The plant typically has broad, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive reddish coloration on the veins and undersides. It produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, and its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Rumex \u00d7 weberi is often found in moist, disturbed soils and is considered a common weed in agricultural and garden settings."
