It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and bright yellow flowers with numerous petals. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often near streams, ponds, and lake margins. Its leaves are finely divided and arranged in a whorled pattern, contributing to its distinctive appearance.
