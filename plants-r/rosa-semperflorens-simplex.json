    "intro": "Rosa semperflorens simplex, commonly known as the everblooming shrub rose, is a compact, hardy plant native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its dense, bushy growth habit and its ability to produce flowers throughout the growing season. The plant features small, fragrant flowers in a variety of colors, including pink, red, and white. Its foliage is dark green and glossy, providing an attractive backdrop for the blooms. Rosa semperflorens simplex is well-suited for containers, borders, and as a ground cover due to its low maintenance and resilience."
