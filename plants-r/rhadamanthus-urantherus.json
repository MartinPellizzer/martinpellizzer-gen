It is characterized by its vibrant orange and yellow flowers, which bloom in clusters during the wet season. The plant has long, slender stems and broad, lance-shaped leaves that help it thrive in humid, shaded environments. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is prized for its ornamental value in horticulture. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires careful conservation efforts."
