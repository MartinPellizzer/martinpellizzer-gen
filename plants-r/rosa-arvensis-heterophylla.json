    "intro": "Rosa arvensis heterophylla, commonly known as the field rose or creeping rose, is a perennial shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves that vary in shape depending on the growth conditions. The plant produces fragrant pink to white flowers in late spring to early summer. Its flowers are followed by red, hairy fruits called hips, which are rich in vitamin C. Rosa arvensis heterophylla is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of habitats, including roadsides and meadows."
