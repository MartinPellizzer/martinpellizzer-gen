It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
