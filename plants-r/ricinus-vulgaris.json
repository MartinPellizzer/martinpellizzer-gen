    "intro": "Ricinus vulgaris, commonly known as castor bean, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves and distinctive spiny seed capsules. The plant produces toxic seeds that contain ricin, one of the most potent natural toxins. Ricinus vulgaris is also valued for its oil extracted from the seeds, which has industrial and cosmetic applications. It thrives in warm climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value as well as its economic importance."
