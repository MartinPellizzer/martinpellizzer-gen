    "intro": "Ruscus laxus, commonly known as common spurge or butcher's broom, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features dense clusters of fleshy, oval leaves that are typically dark green and slightly waxy in texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers in the spring, which are followed by red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and as a ground cover. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for centuries."
