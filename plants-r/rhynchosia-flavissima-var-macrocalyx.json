    "intro": "Rhynchosia flavissima var. macrocalyx, commonly known as the large-flowered yellow cowpea, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers, which are often larger than those of the typical species. The plant produces pod-like fruits that contain edible seeds, similar to other members of the legume family. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three leaflets that are typically oval in shape. This variety is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its potential agricultural uses."
