    "intro": "Rapuntium cinereum, commonly known as gray cabbages, is a species of flowering plant in the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and grayish-green foliage. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in racemes. Its leaves are succulent and often covered in a fine layer of wax, which gives them their distinctive appearance. Native to southern Europe, it thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in coastal areas."
