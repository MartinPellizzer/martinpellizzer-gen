    "intro": "Ribes resinosum, commonly known as the sticky ninebark, is a deciduous shrub native to North America. It is characterized by its rough, peeling bark that becomes sticky when damaged. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers in early spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits in late summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in stream banks and woodland edges. Ribes resinosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing food for birds and insects."
