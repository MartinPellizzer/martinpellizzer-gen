    "intro": "Rubus gigantiflorus, commonly known as the giant-flowered raspberry, is a rare and striking member of the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its large, showy white or pink flowers that can reach up to 10 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces edible berries similar to those of common raspberries, though they are generally smaller and less commonly cultivated. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands. Due to its rarity and unique appearance, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
