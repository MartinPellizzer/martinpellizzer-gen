    "intro": "Rubus alixensis, commonly known as the Alis Mountain raspberry, is a species of bramble native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its erect or spreading growth habit, with thorny stems and pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or yellow when ripe, attracting various pollinators and wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
