    "intro": "Ranunculus decumbens, commonly known as the prostrate buttercup, is a low-growing perennial herb native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features a mat-forming growth habit with slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with five to eleven petals, typically appearing in early spring. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a hairy surface that helps reduce water loss. Ranunculus decumbens thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
