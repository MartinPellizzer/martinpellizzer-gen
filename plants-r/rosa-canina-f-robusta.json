    "intro": "Rosa canina f. robusta, commonly known as the robust dogrose, is a botanical variant of the common dogrose, Rosa canina. It is characterized by its larger, more robust growth compared to the typical form, with sturdy stems and dense foliage. The flowers are usually pink or white, similar to the parent species, and bloom in late spring to early summer. It produces red, hairy fruits called hips, which are edible and used in traditional medicine. This form is often found in hedgerows and woodland edges across Europe."
