    "intro": "Ranunculus canus var. typicus, commonly known as the white crowfoot, is a herbaceous perennial native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It features delicate, white to pale yellow flowers with five to eight petals, typically arranged in a cup-like cluster. The plant has finely divided, trifoliate leaves that are often covered in a soft, silky coating. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges. Its botanical name reflects its pale coloration and its classification within the Ranunculaceae family."
