    "intro": "Rhus pentaphylla, commonly known as the five-leaf sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which typically consist of five leaflets, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in catkins, followed by red, fuzzy berries that are a food source for birds and other wildlife. Rhus pentaphylla thrives in moist to mesic soils and is often found in woodland edges and along stream banks. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in suitable climates."
