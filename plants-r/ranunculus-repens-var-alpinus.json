    "intro": "Ranunculus repens var. alpinus, commonly known as the alpine buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its bright yellow flowers and trifoliate leaves. It is native to alpine regions of Europe and Asia, thriving in rocky and moist environments. The plant typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm, with slender stems that often lie prostrate or form mats. Its flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer, are surrounded by a ring of small, petal-like sepals. The species is notable for its ability to colonize disturbed or barren soils in high-altitude habitats."
