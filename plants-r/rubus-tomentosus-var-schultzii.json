    "intro": "Rubus tomentosus var. schultzii, commonly known as the Schultze bramble, is a shrub-like plant native to parts of North America. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and thorny stems, which are typical features of the Rubus genus. The leaves are usually ovate to elliptic in shape, with a grayish-white underside due to the presence of fine, woolly hairs. It produces small, white to pinkish flowers in the spring, followed by red berries that are edible but often tart. This plant thrives in moist, wooded areas and is often found in the understory of forests."
