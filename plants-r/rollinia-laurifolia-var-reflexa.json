    "intro": "Rollinia laurifolia var. reflexa, commonly known as the reflexed laurelberry, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are usually dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by edible, bright red berries. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its dense foliage and vibrant fruit, making it suitable for ornamental gardening. The varietal form 'reflexa' is distinguished by the reflexed (curled backward) margins of its leaves, which give it a unique appearance."
