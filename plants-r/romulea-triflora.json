    "intro": "Romulea triflora, commonly known as the three-flowered romulea, is a perennial bulbous plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its striking, spurred flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces three to five flowers per stem, each with a distinctive, hood-like structure. Its leaves are grass-like and form a basal rosette, and it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. Romulea triflora is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to Mediterranean climates."
