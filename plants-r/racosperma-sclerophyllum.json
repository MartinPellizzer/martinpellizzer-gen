    "intro": "Racosperma sclerophyllum, commonly known as the hard-leaved acacia, is a shrub native to Australia. It is characterized by its small, rigid, and often grey-green leaves, which are adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in dense, spherical clusters, which attract a variety of pollinators. Its woody stems are thick and branched, providing structural support in its natural habitat. Racosperma sclerophyllum is often found in dry sclerophyll forests and is well-suited to low-nutrient soils."
