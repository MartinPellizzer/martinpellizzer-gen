    "intro": "Romulea subpalustris, commonly known as the marsh romulea, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and North Africa. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, thriving in areas with consistently moist soil. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it plays a role in supporting local pollinator populations. Romulea subpalustris is often found in open, sunny environments such as meadows and riverbanks."
