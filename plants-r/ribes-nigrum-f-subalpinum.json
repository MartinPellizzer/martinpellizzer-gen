    "intro": "Ribes nigrum f. subalpinum, commonly known as the alpine gooseberry, is a subspecies of the blackcurrant native to high-altitude regions of the Alps and other mountainous areas. It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its upright growth habit and small, elliptical leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of small, dark red berries that are typically harvested in late summer. These berries are rich in antioxidants and have a tart flavor, making them suitable for culinary use. Botanically, it is distinguished by its compact form and adaptation to cold, nutrient-poor soils."
