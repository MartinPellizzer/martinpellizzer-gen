    "intro": "Rubus persanimontis var. infirmus, commonly known as the weak-stemmed bramble, is a lesser-known variant of the Rubus genus, characterized by its slender, often sparsely branched stems. It typically grows in temperate regions with moist, well-drained soils, often found in woodland edges or underbrush. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are usually red or black in color, similar to other raspberries and blackberries. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it has a general appearance resembling other Rubus species. Due to its limited distribution and rarity, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
