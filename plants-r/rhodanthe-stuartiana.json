    "intro": "Rhodanthe stuartiana, commonly known as Stuart's everlasting, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the daisy family, Asteraceae, and is characterized by its showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is typically found in sandy or gravelly soils in coastal regions, thriving in full sun. Its flowers are often long-lasting, which is why it is also called everlasting, and it is used in horticulture for its ornamental value. Rhodanthe stuartiana is also valued for its ecological role, providing nectar for native pollinators."
