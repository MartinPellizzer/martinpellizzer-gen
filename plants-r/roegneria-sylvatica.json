    "intro": "Roegneria sylvatica, commonly known as the forest grass or sylvatic wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks, where it forms dense, low-growing clumps. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming extensive mats that stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Roegneria sylvatica is valued in ecological restoration projects for its ability to thrive in challenging, disturbed habitats."
