    "intro": "Rhaptostylum citrifolium, commonly known as the citrifoliate rhaptostylum, is a rare and lesser-known plant species belonging to the family Meliaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, citrus-scented leaves that are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a waxy surface. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by elongated, woody fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, typically in well-drained soils and partial shade. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
