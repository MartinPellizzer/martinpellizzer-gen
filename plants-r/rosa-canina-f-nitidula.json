    "intro": "Rosa canina f. nitidula, commonly known as the smooth rose or the white rose, is a botanical variant of the dog rose. It is characterized by its smooth, hairless stems and leaves, distinguishing it from the typical Rosa canina. The flowers are usually pale pink to white, with five petals and a prominent central cone. This form is often found in woodland edges and open areas, thriving in well-drained soils. It produces red, hairy hips that are edible and used in traditional herbal remedies."
