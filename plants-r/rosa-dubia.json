    "intro": "Rosa dubia, commonly known as the rare desert rose, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces showy, pale pink to white flowers with a subtle fragrance. The plant has narrow, silvery-green leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Its flowers typically bloom in late spring or early summer, adding a delicate beauty to its harsh habitat. Rosa dubia is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in challenging conditions."
