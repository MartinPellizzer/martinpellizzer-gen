It is a cross between a blackberry (Rubus fruticosus) and a raspberry (Rubus idaeus), resulting in a plant that exhibits traits of both parent species. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or black in color, with a tart flavor. It thrives in temperate climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. This hybrid is valued for its unique taste and is often cultivated for both commercial and home garden use."
