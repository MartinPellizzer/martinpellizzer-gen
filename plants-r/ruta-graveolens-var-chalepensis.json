    "intro": "Ruta graveolens var. chalepensis, commonly known as Turkish rue, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features aromatic, lance-shaped leaves with a strong, pungent odor due to the presence of volatile oils. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, leathery fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable plant in both horticulture and herbal remedies."
