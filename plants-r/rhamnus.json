    "intro": "Rhamnus, commonly known as buckthorn, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rhamnaceae. These plants are typically shrubs or small trees, characterized by their simple, alternate leaves and small, often yellowish flowers. Many species produce berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. The bark and leaves of some Rhamnus species have been used in traditional medicine for their astringent properties. They are widely distributed across temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere."
