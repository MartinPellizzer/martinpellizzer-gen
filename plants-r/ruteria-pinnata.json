    "intro": "Ruteria pinnata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved ruteria, is a shrub native to South America, particularly found in Argentina and Chile. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged with narrow, elongated leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by fruiting bodies that are capsules containing numerous seeds. Ruteria pinnata thrives in dry, sunny environments and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been introduced to other parts of the world for horticultural purposes."
