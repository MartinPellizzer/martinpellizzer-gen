    "intro": "Rubus sweginzowianus, commonly known as the Sweginzow's blackberry, is a species of brambles native to the high-altitude regions of South America, particularly in the Andes. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and thorny stems, typical of many Rubus species. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are often edible, though they may have a tart flavor. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it thrives in cool, moist environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and somewhat obscure member of the Rubus genus."
