    "intro": "Rhus filicifolia, commonly known as the fernleaf sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which resemble the fronds of ferns, and its clusters of small, red berries that appear in the fall. The plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. Its ornamental value comes from its vibrant autumn foliage and the striking red berries that persist through winter. Rhus filicifolia is also valued for its ability to tolerate various soil conditions and its role in supporting local wildlife."
