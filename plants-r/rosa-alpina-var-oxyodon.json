    "intro": "Rosa alpina var. oxyodon, commonly known as the Alpine rose, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of fragrant, pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features dark green, serrated leaves and produces small, red hips that are rich in vitamin C. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine landscapes."
