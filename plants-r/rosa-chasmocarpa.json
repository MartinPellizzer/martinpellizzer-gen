    "intro": "Rosa chasmocarpa, commonly known as the canyon rose, is a species of flowering shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of fragrant, pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has dark green, glossy leaves and produces edible, though tart, red hips that persist into winter. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for dry, rocky habitats. Rosa chasmocarpa is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological role in supporting pollinators and wildlife."
