    "intro": "Rheum tibeticum, commonly known as Tibetan rhubarb, is a perennial plant native to the high altitudes of the Tibetan Plateau. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and tall, reddish stems. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers in early summer. Its rhubarb-like roots are used in traditional medicine for their laxative properties. However, the plant is toxic if consumed in large quantities, making it important to handle with care."
