    "intro": "Rhytiglossa ptychostoma, commonly known as the mountain orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to South America. It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky areas, thriving in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are linear and often covered in a fine, hairy texture, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
