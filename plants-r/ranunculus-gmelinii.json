    "intro": "Ranunculus gmelinii, commonly known as the alpine buttercup, is a flowering plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, yellow flowers with five petals. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky habitats, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three deeply lobed leaflets, and it produces small, hairy seeds that are dispersed by wind. Ranunculus gmelinii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
