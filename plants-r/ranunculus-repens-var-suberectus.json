    "intro": "Ranunculus repens var. suberectus, commonly known as the upright buttercup, is a low-growing perennial plant characterized by its spreading rhizomes and dense clusters of bright yellow flowers. It typically thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in wet meadows, riverbanks, and marshy areas. The leaves are palmately divided with serrated edges, and the flowers have five to eight petals that are usually bright yellow with a darker central blotch. This variety is distinguished by its more upright growth habit compared to the typical spreading form of Ranunculus repens. It is a valued plant in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
