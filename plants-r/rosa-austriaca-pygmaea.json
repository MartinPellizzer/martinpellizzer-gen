    "intro": "Rosa austriaca pygmaea, commonly known as the Austrian dwarf rose, is a compact shrub native to the Alps of Central Europe. It features small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has dark green, glossy leaves and produces hips that are edible and rich in vitamin C. It is well-suited for rock gardens and borders due to its low-growing habit. Rosa austriaca pygmaea is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in temperate climates."
