    "intro": "Rhamnus virgata var. aprica, commonly known as the apricot buckthorn, is a shrub or small tree native to parts of Asia, particularly China. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually glossy and dark green. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by small, fleshy fruits that are edible but often have a bitter taste. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or shrubland habitats. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
