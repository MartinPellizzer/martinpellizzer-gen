    "intro": "Rubus furvus subsp. venustulus, commonly known as the showy blackberry, is a species of brambles native to the western United States. It is characterized by its thorny stems, trifoliate leaves, and clusters of small white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces edible berries that are typically dark purple to black when mature, though they are often less flavorful compared to other blackberry varieties. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, sunny locations. This subspecies is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its role in local ecosystems."
