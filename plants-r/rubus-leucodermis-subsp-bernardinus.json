It produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant's fruit, which is typically small and tart, develops from these flowers and is often used in local foraging. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. The subspecies is characterized by its slender stems and distinctive, leathery leaves."
