    "intro": "Rubus obesus, commonly known as the fat-hairy raspberry, is a species of bramble native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its dense, hairy stems and broad, lobed leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces showy, pale yellow to orange flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, hairy berries that ripen in late summer. Its fruits are edible but have a tart flavor and are often used in jams and desserts. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is an important component of its native ecosystem."
