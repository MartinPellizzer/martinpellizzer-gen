    "intro": "Rhexia itambana, commonly known as the Florida rain lily, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It features showy, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, often with a red or orange center. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, thriving in moist, sandy soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Rhexia itambana plays an important role in its ecosystem by providing nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
