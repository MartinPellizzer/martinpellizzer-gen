    "intro": "Rhododendron minus, commonly known as the dwarf azalea, is a compact evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of western China. It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 feet, featuring dense, dark green foliage that provides a lush backdrop for its showy flowers. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, blooming in late spring to early summer. It prefers acidic, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Rhododendron minus is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in cooler, moist environments."
