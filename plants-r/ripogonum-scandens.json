    "intro": "Ripogonum scandens, commonly known as the climbing morning glory, is a vigorous vine native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features heart-shaped, dark green leaves that are opposite and often have a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple, typically blooming in the early morning. Its rapid growth habit makes it both a valuable ornamental plant and a potential weed in cultivated areas. Ripogonum scandens is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks."
