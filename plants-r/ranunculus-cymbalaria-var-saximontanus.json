    "intro": "Ranunculus cymbalaria var. saximontanus, commonly known as the saximontan water crowfoot, is a perennial aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to Europe. It typically grows in shallow waters, such as ponds, streams, and wet meadows, where it thrives in moist, often calcareous soils. The plant features delicate, floating or submerged leaves with a distinctive lobed shape, and it produces small, yellowish flowers with five petals. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread vegetatively. This variety is often found in rocky or gravelly substrates, contributing to its specific ecological niche."
