    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 megabelus, commonly known as the giant blackberry, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Rubus ursinus (slippery elm) and Rubus fruticosus (bramble). It is characterized by its large, thorny stems and dark purple to black berries that are typically larger than those of its parent species. The plant thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils. Its berries are edible but have a tart flavor, and the plant is known for its vigorous growth and ability to form dense thickets. Botanically, it exhibits traits of both parent species, making it a subject of interest in plant hybridization studies."
