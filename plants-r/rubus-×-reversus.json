    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 reversus, commonly known as the blackberry raspberry, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Rubus fruticosus (blackberry) and Rubus ideaus (raspberry). It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark red to black in color, with a sweet-tart flavor. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its edible berries. The hybrid nature of Rubus \u00d7 reversus contributes to its adaptability and genetic diversity."
