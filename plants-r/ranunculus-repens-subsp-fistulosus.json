    "intro": "Ranunculus repens subsp. fistulosus, commonly known as the creeping buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its prostrate growth habit and bright yellow flowers. It typically features simple, trifoliate or pinnate leaves and produces small, showy flowers with five petals. This subspecies is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in moist, disturbed soils such as riverbanks and meadows. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a common weed in agricultural and wetland areas. Its botanical features make it adaptable to a variety of environmental conditions."
