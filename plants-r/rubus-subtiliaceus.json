It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically harvested in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial shade, often found in woodland edges and hedgerows. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and agricultural settings."
