    "intro": "Rosa tomentosa var. properata, commonly known as the woolly rose or the creeping rose, is a deciduous shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, grayish-white pubescent foliage and clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has a sprawling growth habit, often forming low mats or spreading ground cover. Its stems are covered in fine, woolly hairs, which provide insulation and help reduce water loss. It is well adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardiness."
