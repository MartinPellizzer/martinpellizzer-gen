    "intro": "Rubus perdigitatus, commonly known as the five-finger blackberry, is a species of brambles native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves that often have five lobes, resembling fingers. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black when ripe. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including woodlands and disturbed soils, and is often found in the understory of forests. The plant is valued for its edible berries, though they are generally less palatable than those of other Rubus species."
