    "intro": "Robinia inermis fastigiata-aureovariegata, commonly known as the golden variegated false acacia, is a compact, columnar shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features striking, narrow, dark green leaves with prominent yellow variegation, enhancing its ornamental value. The plant produces fragrant, pale yellow flowers in late spring, which are clustered in racemes. Its bark is smooth and grayish, becoming fissured with age, and it is moderately drought-tolerant once established. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for small gardens and landscapes."
