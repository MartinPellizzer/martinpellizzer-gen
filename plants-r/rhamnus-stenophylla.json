    "intro": "Rhamnus stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in forest edges and scrublands. The plant has small, ovate leaves that are dark green on top and pale underneath, with a leathery texture. Its flowers are clustered in small inflorescences and are followed by small, capsule-like fruits that contain a single seed. Rhamnus stenophylla is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in horticulture for its ornamental qualities."
