    "intro": "Rosa canina var. tomentella, commonly known as the woolly dog rose, is a subspecies of the dog rose native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its densely hairy stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by orange-red hips, which are rich in vitamin C. It is often found in woodland edges, hedgerows, and disturbed soils, thriving in full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and historical use in herbal medicine, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
