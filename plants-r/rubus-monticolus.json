    "intro": "Rubus monticolus, commonly known as the alpine raspberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, aggregate fruits. The plant typically grows at high elevations, where it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it produces white to pale pink flowers in the spring. The fruits, which ripen in late summer, are edible and often used in local cuisines or for making jams and syrups."
