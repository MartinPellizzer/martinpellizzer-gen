    "intro": "Rheum laciniatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rhubarb, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, palmately lobed leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in early summer, which are followed by elongated, reddish berries. Its roots are thick and fleshy, containing high concentrations of oxalic acid, making them toxic if ingested. Despite its toxicity, Rheum laciniatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
