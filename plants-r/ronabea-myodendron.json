    "intro": "Ronabea myodendron, commonly known as the sacred lotus of ancient Egypt, is a flowering plant native to the Nile River region. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that bloom in a range of colors, including white, pink, and red. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, supported by long, flexible stems. Its flowers open during the day and close at night, a behavior known as nyctinasty. The plant has been held in high spiritual and symbolic significance in Egyptian culture for thousands of years."
