    "intro": "Rosa rhaetica var. cadolensis, commonly known as the Rhaetic rose, is a rare and ancient species native to the Alps. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and dense, thorny stems. The plant produces showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are compound, with five to seven leaflets, and it is often found in rocky, well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
