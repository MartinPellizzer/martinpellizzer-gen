    "intro": "Rhyticocos, commonly known as the golden thorn, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Anacardiaceae, which includes other plants like the cashew and poison ivy. The plant is characterized by its woody stem, pinnately compound leaves, and small, yellowish flowers. Rhyticocos produces small, red berries that are often used in traditional medicine. Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and potentially hazardous due to its toxic compounds."
