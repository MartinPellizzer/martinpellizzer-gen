    "intro": "Rhus dyeri, commonly known as the silverleaf sumac, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are alternate and composed of 11 to 21 elliptical leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in panicles, followed by red, fuzzy fruits that are edible for birds and some mammals. Its silver-gray undersides of the leaves give it a distinctive appearance, and it is often found in dry, rocky soils. Rhus dyeri is also known for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in challenging environmental conditions."
