    "intro": "Rubus parvifraxinifolius, commonly known as the Japanese blackberry, is a species of bramble native to East Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or black when ripe. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in regions outside its native range."
