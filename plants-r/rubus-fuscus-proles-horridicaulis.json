    "intro": "Rubus fuscus proles horridicaulis, commonly known as the rough-stemmed blackberry, is a species of bramble native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems, dark green leaves with serrated edges, and small, aggregate fruits that mature to a deep black color. The plant typically grows in woodland edges, hedgerows, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its flowers are pale green with five petals, and it produces seeds that are dispersed by birds and animals. The plant is valued for its edible berries, though they are often described as having a tart and somewhat bitter flavor."
