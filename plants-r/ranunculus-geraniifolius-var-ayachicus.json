    "intro": "Ranunculus geraniifolius var. ayachicus, commonly known as the Ayachic Mountain Crowfoot, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Ayachic Valley in the Andes. It is characterized by its delicate, palmate leaves and clusters of small, bright yellow flowers. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Its botanical features include hairy stems and deeply lobed foliage, which help it adapt to its mountainous surroundings. Due to its restricted distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native range."
