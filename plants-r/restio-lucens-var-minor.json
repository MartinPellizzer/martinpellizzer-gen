    "intro": "Restio lucens var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf shining restio, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Restionaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and compact growth habit. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland fynbos vegetation. Due to its delicate appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
