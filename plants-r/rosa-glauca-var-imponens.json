    "intro": "Rosa glauca var. imponens, commonly known as the blue rose, is a rare and striking variant of the Rosa glauca species. It is characterized by its pale blue to lavender-colored flowers, which are a result of a unique genetic mutation affecting pigmentation. The plant typically grows as a shrub with thorny stems and dark green, ovate leaves. It thrives in temperate climates and requires well-drained soil and full sun exposure. Due to its rarity and beauty, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by specialty growers."
