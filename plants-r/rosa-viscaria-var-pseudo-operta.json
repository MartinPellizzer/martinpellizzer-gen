    "intro": "Rosa viscaria var. pseudo-operta, commonly known as the creeping pink, is a flowering shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with arching stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are compound, consisting of five to seven oval-shaped leaflets, and are covered in fine, velvety hairs. This variety is well-suited for rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardy nature and ornamental flowers."
