    "intro": "Rhododendron argyrophyllum subsp. hejiangense, commonly known as the Hejiang silverleaf rhododendron, is a shrub native to China, specifically the Hubei and Sichuan provinces. It is characterized by its silvery-white undersides on its leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, pink to purple flowers in the spring. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and partial shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its attractive foliage and showy blooms."
