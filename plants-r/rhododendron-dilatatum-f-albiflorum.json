    "intro": "Rhododendron dilatatum f. albiflorum, commonly known as the white-flowered alpine rhododendron, is a rare and striking plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its broad, leathery leaves and showy, white or pale pink flowers. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions."
