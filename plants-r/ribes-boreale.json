    "intro": "Ribes boreale, commonly known as the white currant, is a deciduous shrub native to the northern regions of North America. It produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by edible berries that ripen in late summer. The plant is characterized by its alternate, simple leaves with serrated edges and smooth, grayish bark. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas or along stream banks. Ribes boreale is valued for its ornamental appeal and its historical use in traditional medicine."
