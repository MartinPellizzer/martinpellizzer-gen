    "intro": "Ranunculus trichophyllus proles trichophylloides, commonly known as the trichophyllous buttercup, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of Europe. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family, characterized by its showy, often yellow or white flowers with numerous petals. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors or stream banks. Its leaves are deeply lobed and covered in fine hairs, which give it its scientific name. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many areas."
