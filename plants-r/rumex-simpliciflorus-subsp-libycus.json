    "intro": "Rumex simpliciflorus subsp. libycus, commonly known as the Libyan dock, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North Africa. It typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant features lance-shaped leaves with a prominent midrib and produces small, clustered flowers in spring. It belongs to the Polygonaceae family, which is characterized by its unique leaf morphology and often edible or medicinal properties. The subspecies libycus is distinguished by its shorter stature and more compact growth habit compared to the typical form of R. simpliciflorus."
