    "intro": "Randia ferox, commonly known as the devil's backbone, is a shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems that often appear twisted or contorted, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by red, berry-like fruits. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and often have a slightly rough texture. Randia ferox is adapted to grow in tropical and subtropical regions, often in disturbed or sunny habitats."
