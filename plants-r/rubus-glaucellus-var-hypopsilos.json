    "intro": "Rubus glaucellus var. hypopsilos, commonly known as the alpine bramble, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, thorny stems and small, clustered leaves with a waxy, bluish-green underside. The plant produces white to pale pink flowers in early summer, followed by edible, red berries that are often used in local cuisines. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
