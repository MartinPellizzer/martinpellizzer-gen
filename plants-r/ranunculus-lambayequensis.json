    "intro": "Ranunculus lambayequensis, commonly known as the Lambayeque buttercup, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Peru. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, showy yellow flowers with a prominent central pistil. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the coast, thriving in arid and temperate climates. Its leaves are palmately divided, and the flowers bloom in early spring. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species of the Peruvian coastline."
