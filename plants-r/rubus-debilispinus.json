    "intro": "Rubus debilispinus, commonly known as the weak-spined raspberry, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its slender, thorny stems and small, aggregate fruits. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the flowers are pinkish-white with five petals. The fruit, though edible, is generally small and less commercially valuable compared to other raspberry species."
