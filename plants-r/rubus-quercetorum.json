    "intro": "Rubus quercetorum, commonly known as the oakberry bush, is a species of brambles native to the temperate regions of Europe. It is characterized by its woody stems and clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces edible berries that are typically red or black in color, which ripen in late summer or early autumn. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream sides. The leaves are usually trifoliate, with a serrated edge, and the plant is often found in association with oak trees."
