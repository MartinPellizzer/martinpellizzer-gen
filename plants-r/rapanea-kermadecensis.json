It is a small evergreen shrub that typically grows in coastal and rocky habitats. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by small, fleshy berries. Its leaves are glossy and elliptical, with a leathery texture. Rapanea kermadecensis is notable for its limited distribution and is considered a rare species within its native range."
