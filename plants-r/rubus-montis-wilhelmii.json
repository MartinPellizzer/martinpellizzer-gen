    "intro": "Rubus montis-wilhelmii, commonly known as Wilhelm's bramble, is a species of flowering plant in the rose family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe, particularly in the Alps. The plant is characterized by its thorny stems, trifoliate leaves, and small, aggregate fruits. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and forest edges. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in some regions."
