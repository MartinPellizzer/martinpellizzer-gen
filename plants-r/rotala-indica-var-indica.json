    "intro": "Rotala indica var. indica, commonly known as the Indian waterwheel plant, is a submerged aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It features whorled leaves that are typically bright green and have a waxy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often submerged, though they can emerge just below the water surface. It is often cultivated in aquariums for its ornamental value and ability to provide habitat for aquatic life. Rotala indica var. indica thrives in freshwater environments with moderate to high light conditions."
