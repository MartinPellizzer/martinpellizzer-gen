    "intro": "Rhynchospora capillacea var. leviseta, commonly known as the slender hairgrass, is a grass species native to wetland and marshy habitats in North America. It is characterized by its fine, hair-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense mats that stabilize the surrounding environment. Its flowers are usually greenish or brownish, and it plays a role in supporting local biodiversity by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates. Rhynchospora capillacea var. leviseta is an important indicator species for wetland health and ecological integrity."
