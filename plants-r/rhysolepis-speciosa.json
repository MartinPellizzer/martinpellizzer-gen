    "intro": "Rhysolepis speciosa, commonly known as the mountain mahogany, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are alternate and pinnately arranged, and its small, inconspicuous flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces small, woody fruits called samaras, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Rhysolepis speciosa plays an important role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for wildlife in its native range."
