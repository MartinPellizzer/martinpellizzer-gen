    "intro": "Rhamnus pumila var. pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf buckthorn, is a small shrub native to arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender stems and small, elliptical leaves that are usually covered in a whitish bloom. The plant produces small, dark blue berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in poor, rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. Due to its hardy nature, it is often found in tundra and subalpine environments."
