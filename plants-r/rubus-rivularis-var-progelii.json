    "intro": "Rubus rivularis var. progelii, commonly known as the alpine blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to alpine regions of North America. It is a shrub characterized by its dense, thorny stems and small, elliptical leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, dark red to black berries that are typically eaten by birds and other wildlife. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous or high-altitude habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
