    "intro": "Reynoldsia mauiensis var. macrocarpa, commonly known as the Maui rose or Hawaiian rose, is a unique flowering plant native to the island of Maui in Hawaii. It is characterized by its showy, pink to red flowers that bloom during the summer months. The plant has a shrub-like growth habit with woody stems and broad, leathery leaves. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in coastal areas and dry forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
