    "intro": "Rubus koehleri f. subcinerascens, commonly known as the pink-fruited blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive pink to red fruit, which contrasts with the typical black color of other Rubus species. The plant produces aggregate fruits composed of small, achenes surrounded by a fleshy receptacle. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often in shaded, moist environments. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest in horticultural and ecological studies."
