    "intro": "Rodgersia platyphylla, commonly known as the broad-leaved rodgersia, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its large, palmately divided, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces upright, branched stems that bear clusters of showy, pinkish-red flowers in late summer. It thrives in partial to full shade and prefers moist, well-drained soil. Rodgersia platyphylla is a popular choice for shady garden landscapes due to its ornamental foliage and long blooming period."
