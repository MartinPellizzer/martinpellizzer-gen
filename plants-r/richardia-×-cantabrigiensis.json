    "intro": "Richardia \u00d7 cantabrigiensis, commonly known as the Cambridge rush, is a hybrid plant species resulting from the cross between Richardia scabra and Richardia grandiflora. It is a tall, grass-like plant characterized by its stiff, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow to greenish flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. It is typically found in wetland habitats, such as marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and wetland restoration efforts."
