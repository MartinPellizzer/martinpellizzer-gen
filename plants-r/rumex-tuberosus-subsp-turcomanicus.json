    "intro": "Rumex tuberosus subsp. turcomanicus, commonly known as the Turkestan sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Central Asia. It features upright, branched stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height, and its leaves are lanceolate with a distinctive reddish coloration. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a persistent weed in cultivated areas. The plant is adapted to dry, temperate climates and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides."
