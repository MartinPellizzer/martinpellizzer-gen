    "intro": "Rhododendron subsessile, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and showy, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of pink to red. The plant typically grows in acidic, well-drained soils and thrives in partial to full shade. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, providing a striking contrast to the vibrant floral display. Rhododendron subsessile is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in cooler, humid climates."
