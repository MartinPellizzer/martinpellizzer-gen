    "intro": "Rubus sordidescens, commonly known as the dirty raspberry, is a species of bramble native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, dark red fruits. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by the development of its edible berries. Its leaves are typically trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the plant thrives in moist, shaded environments. Due to its rugged appearance and habitat, it is often overlooked in favor of more showy raspberry species."
