It is a shrub characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves, which typically have three to five leaflets. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are usually red or black in color, resembling raspberries. It thrives in moist, wooded areas and is often found in the understory of forests. Its botanical features make it distinct from other Rubus species, particularly in its growth habits and fruit morphology."
