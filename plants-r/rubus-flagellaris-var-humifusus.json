    "intro": "Rubus flagellaris var. humifusus, commonly known as the creeping raspberry, is a low-growing shrub native to the eastern United States. It features arching stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats on the ground. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers in the spring, followed by red, edible berries in the summer. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the plant has a woody stem covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
