It is characterized by its hairy stems and broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in the spring and summer seasons. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and traditional herbal practices."
