    "intro": "Rubus subcalvatus, commonly known as the hairy blackberry, is a species of bramble native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its thorny stems and aggregate fruits that mature to a dark purple or black color. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by the development of its edible berries. Its leaves are typically trifoliate, with serrated edges and a slightly hairy texture. Rubus subcalvatus is often found in moist, wooded areas and thrives in partial to full shade."
