    "intro": "Rytigynia tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly rytigynia, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its hairy, or tomentose, leaves and small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in clusters. Its leaves are typically elliptical or ovate, with a soft, velvety texture due to the dense covering of fine hairs. Rytigynia tomentosa is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in moist, shaded environments."
