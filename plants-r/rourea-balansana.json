    "intro": "Rourea balansana, commonly known as the velvetleaf rourea, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, white flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Rourea balansana is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth."
