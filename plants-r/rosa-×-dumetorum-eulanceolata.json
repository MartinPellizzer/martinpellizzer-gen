    "intro": "Rosa \u00d7 dumetorum eulanceolata, commonly known as the evergland rose, is a hybrid shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and dark green, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hair. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, pink to reddish-pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its horticultural value lies in its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. However, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its aggressive growth habit."
