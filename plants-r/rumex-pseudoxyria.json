    "intro": "Rumex pseudoxyria, commonly known as the narrow-leaved dock, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils such as roadsides, meadows, and riverbanks. The plant features lance-shaped leaves with a waxy surface and reddish veins, and it produces small, greenish flowers in clusters during the spring. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a persistent weed in agricultural and natural areas. The plant is often used in traditional medicine for its purported astringent and anti-inflammatory properties."
