    "intro": "Ranunculus fallacifolius, commonly known as the false leaf buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the Mediterranean region. It features delicate, palmately lobed leaves that are often mistaken for those of other ranunculus species. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with five petals, typically appearing in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance, it is often cultivated in gardens across temperate regions."
