    "intro": "Rubus arbor, commonly known as the blackberry shrub, is a deciduous plant belonging to the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves that are typically trifoliate. The plant produces aggregate fruits, known as blackberries, which develop from the fusion of multiple small drupes. These fruits are rich in antioxidants and are often harvested in late summer. Rubus arbor thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges or disturbed soils."
