    "intro": "Rosa pomifera subsp. recondita, commonly known as the Himalayan rose, is a rare and ornamental species native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its distinctive, large, edible fruits that resemble a cluster of grapes, often used in traditional medicine. The plant produces fragrant, pink to white flowers in early summer, which are followed by the development of its unique fruiting bodies. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is typically found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
