It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its woody stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, white to pink flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by small, yellowish fruits. It is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and is protected in some regions."
