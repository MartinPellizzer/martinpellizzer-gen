    "intro": "Rubus concinnus, commonly known as the slender blackberry, is a species of bramble native to western North America. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and small, dark red to black berries. The plant produces compound leaves with three to five leaflets, and its flowers are typically white or pale pink. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. The berries are edible but have a tart flavor, making them suitable for jams and pies."
