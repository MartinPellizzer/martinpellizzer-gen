    "intro": "Rubus schlechtendalii var. albus, commonly known as the white-flowered everlet, is a rare variant of the everlet raspberry. It is native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia, particularly in China. The plant is a shrub with slender, thornless stems and small, trifoliate leaves. Its most distinguishing feature is its white, five-petaled flowers that bloom in early summer. The fruits are small, aggregate berries that ripen to a deep red, though they are less commonly consumed than other raspberry varieties."
