    "intro": "Rhododendron scabrum subsp. scabrum, commonly known as the roughleaf azalea, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Asia, particularly China and the Himalayas. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage with leathery, dark green leaves that have a rough, textured surface. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to red, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It prefers acidic, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, often growing in cool, moist environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is a notable species in both horticulture and natural habitats."
