It is native to parts of Asia, including China and Japan, where it thrives in temperate climates. The plant is characterized by its slender, often leafless stems and clusters of small, fragrant white or pink flowers. Its leaves are alternate, with serrated edges, and it produces rose-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer.
