    "intro": "Robbairea prostrata var. major, commonly known as the prostrate Robbairea, is a low-growing, trailing plant native to tropical regions. It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft texture. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers, which bloom in summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires bright, indirect light to flourish. Due to its compact form and ornamental flowers, it is often used in hanging baskets or as ground cover in gardens."
