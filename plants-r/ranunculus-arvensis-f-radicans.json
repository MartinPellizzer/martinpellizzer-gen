    "intro": "Ranunculus arvensis f. radicans, commonly known as the spreading field buttercup, is a variant of the field buttercup characterized by its creeping growth habit. It features basal leaves that are palmately divided with lobes that are usually notched or toothed. The plant produces yellow flowers with five petals, typically appearing in early spring. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and along stream banks. This form is notable for its ability to spread vegetatively through stolons, making it a persistent weed in agricultural settings."
