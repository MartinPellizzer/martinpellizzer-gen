    "intro": "Rhynchostele, commonly known as the \"screw pine,\" is a unique tropical plant characterized by its distinctive botanical features. It belongs to the family Pandanaceae and is known for its spirally arranged leaves that give it a helical appearance. The plant's stem is not a typical trunk but rather a woody structure with a central vascular bundle. Rhynchostele has a specialized root system that allows it to thrive in coastal and sandy environments. Its morphology reflects adaptations to salt spray and wind, making it a resilient species in tropical regions."
