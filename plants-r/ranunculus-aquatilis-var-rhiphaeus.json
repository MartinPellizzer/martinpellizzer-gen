    "intro": "Ranunculus aquatilis var. rhiphaeus, commonly known as the water crowfoot, is a aquatic or semi-aquatic plant characterized by its delicate, floating or submerged leaves. It typically has bright yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom from spring to summer. The plant thrives in shallow freshwater environments such as ponds, streams, and wetlands. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize the substrate, while its leaves are divided into small, thread-like segments. This variety is closely related to other members of the Ranunculaceae family, sharing similar floral structures and ecological preferences."
