    "intro": "Radiola radiola, commonly known as the lesser celandine, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a basal rosette of heart-shaped, dark green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by bright orange, toxic berries. Radiola radiola thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its leaves and roots contain toxic compounds, making it potentially harmful to livestock and humans if ingested."
