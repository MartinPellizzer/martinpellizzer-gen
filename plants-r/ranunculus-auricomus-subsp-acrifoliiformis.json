    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus subsp. acrifoliiformis, commonly known as the golden shield buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It features distinctive yellow flowers with five broadly ovate petals that resemble a shield, giving it its common name. The plant has palmate leaves with three to five lobes, and it thrives in moist, calcareous soils. It is often found in meadows, streambanks, and woodland edges. The subspecies is characterized by its slightly different leaf shape and flower structure compared to the typical R. auricomus."
