    "intro": "Rhododendron trichostomum, commonly known as the alpine rhododendron, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or alpine habitats where it forms dense thickets. The plant produces clusters of showy, pink to red flowers in the spring, which are followed by small, leathery berries. Its leaves are dark green, leathery, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Rhododendron trichostomum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing mountainous soils."
