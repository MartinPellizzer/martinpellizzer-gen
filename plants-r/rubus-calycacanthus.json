    "intro": "Rubus calycacanthus, commonly known as the thimbleberry, is a species of bramble native to North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves and small, edible berries that are typically yellow or orange when ripe. The plant produces white or pale pink flowers in the spring, which are clustered in the leaf axils. Its thornless stems and vigorous growth habit make it a common weed in disturbed areas. The botanical features of Rubus calycacanthus make it adaptable to a variety of soil types and light conditions."
