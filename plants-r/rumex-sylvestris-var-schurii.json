    "intro": "Rumex sylvestris var. schurii, commonly known as the Schur's sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Polygonaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive reddish coloration on the underside. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a resilient species in moist, shaded environments. The leaves are edible and have been used historically in traditional cuisines and herbal remedies."
