    "intro": "Racinaea sanctae-martae, commonly known as the Saint Mary's racinaea, is a rare and striking orchid native to the high-altitude cloud forests of South America. It is characterized by its elongated, pendant-like inflorescence and vibrant, bi-colored flowers that range from deep violet to yellow. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or branches, exhibiting a unique epiphytic habit. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insects, and it requires high humidity and indirect light to thrive. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
