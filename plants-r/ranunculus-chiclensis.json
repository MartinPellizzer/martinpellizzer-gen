    "intro": "Ranunculus chiclensis, commonly known as the Mexican buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It features showy, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from white to yellow, with a distinctive greenish center. The plant typically grows to a height of 10 to 30 centimeters, with hairy stems and trifoliate leaves. Its flowers bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge. Ranunculus chiclensis is adapted to moist, well-drained soils and thrives in partial to full shade."
