    "intro": "Rubus obscurus microgene incisifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaf blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its dark, thorny stems and compound leaves with finely serrated edges. The plant produces small, dark purple berries that are typically less palatable to humans but serve as a food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and streambanks. Its botanical features make it a distinctive member of the Rubus genus, with unique morphological traits that aid in its identification."
