    "intro": "Rhododendron decumbens, commonly known as the creeping rhododendron, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It features dense, dark green foliage with leathery leaves that help it conserve moisture in its arid habitat. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, fragrant flowers in shades of pink to red, typically blooming in late spring. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and woodland settings. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a valuable addition to native plant landscapes."
