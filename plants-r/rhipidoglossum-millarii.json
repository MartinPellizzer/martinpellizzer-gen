It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its compact rosette of velvety, waxy leaves. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of purple, pink, and white, often with a contrasting throat. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is widely cultivated as a houseplant."
