    "intro": "Rubus pseudocaesius var. aculeatissimus, commonly known as the prickly blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to certain regions of North America. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and dark purple to black berries that ripen in late summer. The leaves are typically trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the plant produces small white flowers in the spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or thickets. This variety is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes cultivated for its edible fruits."
