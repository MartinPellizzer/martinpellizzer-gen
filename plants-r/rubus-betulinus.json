    "intro": "Rubus betulinus, commonly known as the blackberry shrub, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is native to parts of Europe and Asia and is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of dark purple to black berries. The plant typically grows in woodlands, hedgerows, and disturbed areas, preferring well-drained soils. Its flowers are white or pale pink, and the fruit is edible, though often tart and high in acidity. The plant plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing food for wildlife and supporting pollinators."
