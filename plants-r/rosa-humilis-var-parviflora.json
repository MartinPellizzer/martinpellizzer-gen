    "intro": "Rosa humilis var. parviflora, commonly known as the dwarf garden rose, is a compact, low-growing shrub native to the eastern United States. It features small, fragrant flowers in shades of white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has thorny stems and dark green, trifoliate leaves that provide a dense, bushy appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its hardiness and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
