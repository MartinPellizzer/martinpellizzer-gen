    "intro": "Robiquetia amboinensis, commonly known as the Amboina orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Maluku Islands in Indonesia. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically feature a combination of yellow, green, and red hues. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Robiquetia amboinensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens."
