    "intro": "Rebutia pygmaea f. neosteinmannii, commonly known as the Neosteinmann's miniature rebutia, is a compact, low-growing succulent native to southern Africa. It features small, rounded stems that produce clusters of delicate, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting to its arid environment. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, requiring minimal water to prevent root rot. This cultivar is prized for its ornamental value and ease of care in succulent gardens."
