    "intro": "Rhamphicarpa recurva, commonly known as the spiral liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is a small, mat-forming liverwort that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a distinctive spiral arrangement of its leaf-like structures, which gives it its common name. Its leaves are usually narrow and have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Rhamphicarpa recurva is often found in temperate regions and is adapted to thrive in low-light conditions."
