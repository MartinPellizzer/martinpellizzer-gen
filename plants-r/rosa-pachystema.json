    "intro": "Rosa pachystema, commonly known as the alpine rose, is a species of flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a shrub that typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant produces showy, pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh climates. Rosa pachystema is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
