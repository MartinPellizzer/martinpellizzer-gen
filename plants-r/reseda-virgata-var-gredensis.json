It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and produces small, yellow-orange flowers. The plant has gray-green, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its botanical features make it an attractive and drought-tolerant addition to Mediterranean-style landscapes."
