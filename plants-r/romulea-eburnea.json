    "intro": "Romulea eburnea, commonly known as the silver-rooted glory-of-the-snow, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range from white to pale yellow. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its bulbs are small and often covered in a white, waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. Romulea eburnea is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate, spring-blooming flowers."
