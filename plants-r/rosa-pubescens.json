    "intro": "Rosa pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent rose, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It features thorny stems and is characterized by its clusters of fragrant, pink to red flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has serrated, ovate leaves covered in fine, downy hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. Rosa pubescens thrives in full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its vibrant blooms and persistent, red-orange hips that appear in the fall."
