    "intro": "Retanilla, commonly known as the white-veined orchid, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its striking, often fragrant flowers. The plant typically features long, slender stems and leaves with distinctive white veins. Retanilla species are epiphytic, meaning they grow on the surfaces of trees or other structures rather than in soil. Its unique morphology and ornamental value make it a popular choice for horticultural cultivation."
