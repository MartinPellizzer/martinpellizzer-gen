    "intro": "Rubus elongellus, commonly known as the slender blackberry, is a species of bramble native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its slender, trailing stems and small, dark purple to black berries. The plant produces compound leaves with three to five leaflets, and its flowers are typically white or pale pink. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The berries are edible but have a tart flavor, making them suitable for culinary use."
