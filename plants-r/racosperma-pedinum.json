    "intro": "Racosperma pedinum, commonly known as the slender acacia, is a shrub native to Australia. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod fruits. The plant features small, yellow flowers arranged in racemose inflorescences, which attract various pollinators. Its leaves are bipinnate, with numerous tiny leaflets that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Racosperma pedinum is often found in sandy soils and is adapted to thrive in dry, coastal environments."
