    "intro": "Rechsteineria \u00d7 artefacta, commonly known as the hybrid orchid, is a botanical hybrid resulting from the cross between Rechsteineria lutea and Rechsteineria tenuis. It is a terrestrial orchid native to South Africa, characterized by its slender, upright stems and showy, yellowish-green flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its flowers bloom in late summer, adding a striking visual element to its natural habitat. Due to its rarity and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
