    "intro": "Rubus sachalinensis var. macrophyllus, commonly known as the large-leaf blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its large, elliptical leaves that can reach up to 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces aggregate fruits composed of small, dark purple to black achenes surrounded by a fleshy, white or yellowish receptacle. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forest understories or along streambanks. The species is valued for its ornamental foliage and edible fruits, though it is less commonly cultivated than other blackberry varieties."
