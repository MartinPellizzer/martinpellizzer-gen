It is native to parts of Europe and western Asia, often found in woodland edges and hedgerows. The plant is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of white to pale pink flowers. Its leaves are typically trifoliate, with serrated margins, and it produces small, red berries that are edible. The hairy bramble plays a role in supporting local wildlife, including pollinators and birds."
