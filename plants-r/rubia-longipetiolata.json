It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its slender stems, opposite leaves with a distinctive heart-shaped base, and small, tubular flowers that are typically blue or purple in color.

The plant is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine for its potential antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties."
