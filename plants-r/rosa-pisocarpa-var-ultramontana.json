    "intro": "Rosa pisocarpa var. ultramontana, commonly known as the ultramontane rose, is a rare and ornamental shrub native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It features dense, thorny stems and produces large, showy flowers with deep pink to red petals. The plant is characterized by its aromatic foliage and is often found in rocky, well-drained soils. It blooms in late spring to early summer, adding vibrant color to its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable species for botanical study and conservation efforts."
