    "intro": "Ruehssia dorothyae, commonly known as Dorothy's ruehssia, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Melastomataceae and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range in color from pink to white. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in partial to full shade. Its leaves are opposite and often have a velvety texture, while its stems are slender and branching. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
