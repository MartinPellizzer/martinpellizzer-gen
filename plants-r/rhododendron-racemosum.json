    "intro": "Rhododendron racemosum, commonly known as the clustered rhododendron, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to white. The plant typically grows at elevations between 1,000 and 2,500 meters, thriving in cool, moist, and well-drained soils. Its leaves are dark green, leathery, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Rhododendron racemosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
