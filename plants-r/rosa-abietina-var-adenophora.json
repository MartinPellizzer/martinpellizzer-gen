    "intro": "Rosa abietina var. adenophora, commonly known as the alpine rose, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense, dark green foliage. The plant produces showy, pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
