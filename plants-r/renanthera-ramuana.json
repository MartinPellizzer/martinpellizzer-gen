    "intro": "Renanthera ramuana, commonly known as the Ramuan orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink, white, and purple. The plant has a pseudobulb structure, which helps it store water and nutrients, enabling it to thrive in humid, tropical environments. Its leaves are broad and grass-like, often arranged in a fan shape. This orchid is popular among horticulturists for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
