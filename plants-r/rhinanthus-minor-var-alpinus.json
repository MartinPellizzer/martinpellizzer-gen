    "intro": "Rhinanthus minor var. alpinus, commonly known as the alpine yellow-rattle, is a flowering plant native to mountainous regions of Europe. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, characterized by its parasitic relationship with grasses. The plant produces small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to August. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
