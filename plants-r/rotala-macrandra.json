    "intro": "Rotala macrandra, commonly known as the water crown or floating heart, is a species of aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water surface, often with a reddish or pinkish tinge. The plant produces tiny white flowers that bloom above the water, typically in summer. Rotala macrandra thrives in shallow, still waters and is often used in aquariums and ponds for its ornamental value. Its rapid growth rate makes it an effective plant for water purification and habitat creation for aquatic life."
