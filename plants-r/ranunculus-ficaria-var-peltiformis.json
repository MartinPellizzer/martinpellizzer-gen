    "intro": "Ranunculus ficaria var. peltiformis, commonly known as the broad-leaved water crowfoot, is a aquatic or semi-aquatic flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its floating or submerged leaves that are broadly heart-shaped or rounded, with a waxy surface to repel water. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in early summer. It thrives in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds, ditches, and marshes. Its leaves and flowers are often used in traditional herbal remedies, though it is toxic if ingested."
