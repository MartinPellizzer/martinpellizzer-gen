    "intro": "Rourea calophylla, commonly known as the velvetleaf rourea, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its smooth, often reddish-brown bark and dense, leathery leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by spherical, woody fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland tropical forests. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
