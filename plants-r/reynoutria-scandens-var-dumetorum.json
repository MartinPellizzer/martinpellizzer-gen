    "intro": "Reynoutria scandens var. dumetorum, commonly known as giant knotweed, is a vigorous perennial herb native to eastern Asia. It features rhizomatous growth that allows it to spread rapidly and form dense colonies. The plant has large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in loose inflorescences. Due to its aggressive growth, it is considered an invasive species in many regions outside its native range."
