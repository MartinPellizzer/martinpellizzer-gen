It is a perennial herb with a creeping stem and small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
