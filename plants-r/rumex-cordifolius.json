    "intro": "Rumex cordifolius, commonly known as heartleaf sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves, which are typically covered in fine hairs and have a reddish or purple tint on the underside. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are borne on slender, erect stems. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. The leaves are edible and have a tart, sour flavor due to their high content of oxalic acid."
