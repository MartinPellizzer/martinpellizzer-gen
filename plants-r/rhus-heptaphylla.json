    "intro": "Rhus heptaphylla, commonly known as the seven-leaf buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, typically consisting of seven leaflets, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for birds and wildlife. Its bark is smooth and grayish, and it often has a spreading or upright growth habit. Rhus heptaphylla is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed areas."
