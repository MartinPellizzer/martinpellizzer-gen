    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 infructuosus, commonly known as the blackberry bramble, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Rubus ursinus (the blackberry) and Rubus glaucus (the raspberry). It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces aggregate fruits, known as drupes, which are typically dark purple to black in color when mature. These fruits are edible, though often tart and high in acidity, and are commonly used in jams, pies, and other culinary applications. The plant thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils."
