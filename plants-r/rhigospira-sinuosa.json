    "intro": "Rhigospira sinuosa, commonly known as the zigzag plant, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its distinctive zigzagging stems, which are adapted for support and growth along other plants or structures. The leaves are typically opposite, ovate, and have a smooth or slightly lobed margin. Its flowers are small, fragrant, and often white or pale yellow, appearing in clusters. The plant is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to cover trellises or fences."
