    "intro": "Rubus ninckii, commonly known as the Kew raspberry, is a species of bramble native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its erect or decumbent growth habit and produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red when ripe. The plant has trifoliate leaves with serrated margins and produces white to pale yellow flowers in the spring. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. The fruit is edible and has a flavor similar to raspberries, though it is less commonly cultivated."
