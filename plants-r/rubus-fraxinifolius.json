    "intro": "Rubus fraxinifolius, commonly known as the white bramble, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in early summer, followed by red or black berries that are edible but often tart. Its foliage is typically heart-shaped with a distinctive fraxinus-like leaf pattern, giving it its scientific name. Rubus fraxinifolius is often found in woodlands and hedgerows, where it plays a role in supporting local wildlife."
