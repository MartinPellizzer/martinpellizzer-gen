    "intro": "Rosa caerulea, commonly known as the blue rose, is a hybrid species that does not occur naturally in the wild. It is characterized by its striking blue or lavender-colored petals, which are the result of specific pigmentation caused by anthocyanins. The plant typically grows as a shrub with thorny stems and heart-shaped leaves. It thrives in temperate climates and requires well-drained soil and full sun. Despite its beauty, Rosa caerulea is not a true wild species and is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value."
