    "intro": "Rochea undosa, commonly known as the undulating rock plant, is a succulent species native to South America. It is characterized by its fleshy, often blue-green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. Rochea undosa thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade. It is well adapted to rocky and arid environments, making it a resilient choice for rock gardens."
