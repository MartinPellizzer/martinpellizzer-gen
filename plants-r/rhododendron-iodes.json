    "intro": "Rhododendron iodes, commonly known as the dwarf rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is a compact evergreen shrub characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically blooms in early spring, producing fragrant, pink to purple flowers that attract pollinators. It prefers acidic, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Rhododendron iodes is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in cooler climates."
