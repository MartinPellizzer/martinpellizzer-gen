    "intro": "Rhytidanthe scabra, commonly known as the rough rhytidanthe, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid regions. The plant features woody stems and produces small, tubular flowers that are often pale yellow or greenish in color. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a rough, textured surface, which gives it its common name. Rhytidanthe scabra is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
