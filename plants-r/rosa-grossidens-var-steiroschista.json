    "intro": "Rosa grossidens var. steiroschista, commonly known as the coastal rose, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and dark green, leathery leaves that are adapted to withstand salt spray and strong coastal winds. The plant produces fragrant, pink to red flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in terminal inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dunes and rocky outcrops. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as a ornamental plant in coastal gardens."
