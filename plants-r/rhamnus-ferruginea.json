    "intro": "Rhamnus ferruginea, commonly known as the rusty buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dark green, oval leaves that turn reddish in the fall, and its distinctive, reddish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, followed by black, egg-shaped berries that are an important food source for birds. Rhamnus ferruginea is often found in rocky soils and dry habitats, and it has a moderate growth rate. It is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various environmental conditions."
