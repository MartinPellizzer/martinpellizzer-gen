    "intro": "Rhododendron parvifolium subsp. confertissimum, commonly known as the dense-leaved alpine rhododendron, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and its clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The leaves are small, leathery, and densely packed, providing a dense canopy that helps protect the plant from harsh alpine conditions. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in subalpine and alpine habitats. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in high-elevation ecosystems."
