It features glossy, dark green, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by edible, tuberous roots, which are used in culinary applications. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and prefers well-draining, fertile soil. Due to its compact size and ornamental foliage, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and shaded outdoor spaces."
