    "intro": "Rosa dumalis f. subhispida, commonly known as the subhairy wild rose, is a botanical variant of the wild rose species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, glandular hairs that cover the stems and leaves, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in open woodlands and rocky areas, preferring well-drained soils. Its flowers are usually pink to red, with five petals, and appear in clusters. The subhispida form is notable for its more pronounced pubescence compared to the typical form of Rosa dumalis."
