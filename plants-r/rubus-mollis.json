    "intro": "Rubus mollis, commonly known as the soft blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and thorny stems, which support its climbing structure. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by edible, dark purple berries in the summer. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the plant is often found in moist, shaded woodlands. Rubus mollis plays an important ecological role by providing food for various wildlife species."
