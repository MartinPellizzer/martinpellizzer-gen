    "intro": "Retinispora pisifera, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking yellow flowers with intricate patterns. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks or branches in its natural habitat. Its leaves are long, narrow, and often have a waxy texture, which helps in water retention. Retinispora pisifera is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
