    "intro": "Rhododendron minus var. minus, commonly known as the dwarf azalea, is a compact evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It features small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and red, blooming in early spring. The plant has dark green, leathery leaves that remain on the shrub throughout the year. It prefers acidic, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to form dense, flowering clusters that attract pollinators."
