    "intro": "Rorippa alpina, commonly known as the alpine pennywort, is a small flowering plant native to alpine and arctic regions. It is characterized by its rosette of dark green, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in cold, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in moist, rocky soils and is often found in mountainous areas. Rorippa alpina is an important component of alpine ecosystems, contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
