    "intro": "Rubus micans, commonly known as the silverleaf blackberry, is a species of bramble native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its dark, thorny stems and small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine silvery bloom. The plant produces aggregate fruits composed of tiny, juicy drupes that are typically red or black when mature. It thrives in moist, shady woodlands and is often found in the understory of deciduous forests. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and naturalized areas."
