    "intro": "Rubus macroacanthus, commonly known as the giant blackberry, is a shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its large, thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces dark purple to black berries that are typically larger than those of other Rubus species. These berries are edible but have a strong, tart flavor. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in forest understories."
