    "intro": "Rubus hebecarpos microgene vagabundus, commonly known as the wandering blackberry, is a rare and elusive species within the Rubus genus. It is characterized by its small, dark berries that develop on thorny, bramble-like stems. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, with five petals and numerous stamens. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a delicate and endangered species in its native range."
