    "intro": "Rosa tomentosa var. attenuata, commonly known as the woolly rose or the creeping rose, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant typically grows in a sprawling, ground-covering form, making it suitable for erosion control and ornamental use in gardens. Its leaves are covered in a soft, white pubescence, which helps to reduce water loss in arid conditions. This variety is also valued for its hardiness and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
