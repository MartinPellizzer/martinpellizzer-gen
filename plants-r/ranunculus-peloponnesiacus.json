    "intro": "Ranunculus peloponnesiacus, commonly known as the Peloponnesian buttercup, is a perennial herb native to the rocky slopes and dry grasslands of the Peloponnese region in Greece. It produces delicate, yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has palmate leaves that are deeply lobed, and its stems are hairy and often branched. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a characteristic species of Mediterranean habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant in its native range."
