It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated leaves that are often covered in a rusty-colored pubescence. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which are followed by spherical, woody fruits. Ravensara ferruginea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland forest understories."
