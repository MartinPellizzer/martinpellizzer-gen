    "intro": "Ranunculus pulchellus var. tridentatus, commonly known as the tridentate buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features delicate, palmately lobed leaves with a distinctive tridentate (three-toothed) shape, which gives it its specific epithet. The plant produces showy yellow flowers with five petals, often accompanied by a hairy, green sepal-like structure. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine meadows. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
