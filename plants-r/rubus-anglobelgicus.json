    "intro": "Rubus anglobelgicus, commonly known as the Belgian-English raspberry, is a species of bramble native to parts of Europe. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves. The plant produces aggregate fruits, which are typically red and edible, though they can vary in color depending on the variety. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges and hedgerows. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and locally significant species in its native range."
