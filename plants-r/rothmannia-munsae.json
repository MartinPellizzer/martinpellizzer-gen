    "intro": "Rothmannia munsae, commonly known as the Munsae rothmannia, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Eastern Arc Mountains in Tanzania. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes a wide variety of shrubs and herbs. The plant is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its restricted habitat and limited distribution, Rothmannia munsae is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
