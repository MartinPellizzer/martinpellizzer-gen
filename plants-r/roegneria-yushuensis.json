    "intro": "Roegneria yushuensis, commonly known as the Yushu grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau in China. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool temperatures and well-drained soils. Due to its unique ecological role and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
