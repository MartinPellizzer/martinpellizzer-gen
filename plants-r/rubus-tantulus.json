    "intro": "Rubus tantulus, commonly known as the alpine raspberry, is a species of bramble native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and produces small, edible red berries that ripen in late summer. The plant features compound leaves with serrated edges and has thorny stems typical of the Rubus genus. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitats."
