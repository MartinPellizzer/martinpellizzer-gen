    "intro": "Roegneria mutica, commonly known as the slender false brome, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It typically grows in moist to wet environments, such as marshes and wet meadows, and is often found in the northern United States and southern Canada. The plant has slender,\u4e1b\u751f\u7684 (clumped) stems that are usually less than 30 centimeters tall, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are arranged in a loose panicle, and it produces small, spikelet-like flowers. Roegneria mutica plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and provides habitat for various invertebrates."
