    "intro": "Rosa limitans, commonly known as the sand rose, is a species of flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub-like plant with woody stems and dense, spiny foliage that helps it survive in harsh desert conditions. The plant produces showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are small, narrow, and often covered in fine hairs, which reduce water loss. Rosa limitans is adapted to sandy soils and can thrive in full sun, making it a hardy and resilient plant in desert environments."
