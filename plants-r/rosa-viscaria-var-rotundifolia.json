    "intro": "Rosa viscaria var. rotundifolia, commonly known as the roundleaf shrub rose, is a compact, deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, pink to white flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is a popular choice for gardeners seeking a low-maintenance, visually appealing shrub."
