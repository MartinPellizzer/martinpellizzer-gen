    "intro": "Rosa canina f. perecesensis, commonly known as the Spanish rose or the wild dog rose, is a botanical variant of the common dog rose. It is characterized by its smaller, more delicate flowers and shorter, more compact growth habit compared to the typical Rosa canina. This form is native to southern Europe and thrives in sunny, well-drained soils. Its leaves are usually more lobed and its thorns are shorter and less dense. The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in herbal medicine."
