    "intro": "Rosa mollis var. lundquistii, commonly known as the Lundquist's soft rose, is a rare and delicate species native to specific regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its soft, fuzzy foliage and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its botanical features include a low-growing habit with thornless stems and narrow, ovate leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable species for botanical study and conservation efforts."
