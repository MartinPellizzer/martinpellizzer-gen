    "intro": "Rhaphidophora forbesii, commonly known as the Forbes' snake plant, is a tropical evergreen herb native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Araceae family and is characterized by its upright, sword-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a glossy sheen. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are enclosed in a spadix, typical of the Araceae family. It thrives in low-light conditions and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Rhaphidophora forbesii is popular as a houseplant due to its air-purifying qualities and low maintenance requirements."
