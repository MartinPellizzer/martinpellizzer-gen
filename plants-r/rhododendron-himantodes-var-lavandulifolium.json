    "intro": "Rhododendron himantodes var. lavandulifolium, commonly known as the lavender-leaved rhododendron, is a striking evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped leaves that emit a subtle lavender scent, giving it its common name. The plant produces dense clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to purple, typically blooming in late spring. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is often cultivated in horticultural settings."
