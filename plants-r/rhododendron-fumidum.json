    "intro": "Rhododendron fumidum, commonly known as the misty rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia, particularly in countries like China, Vietnam, and Myanmar. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its humid, cool habitat. The plant produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pale pink to deep purple, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for shaded garden landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is also sometimes cultivated for conservation purposes."
