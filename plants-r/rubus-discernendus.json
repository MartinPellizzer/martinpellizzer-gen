    "intro": "Rubus discernendus, commonly known as the distinguishing raspberry, is a species of bramble native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits known as berries, which are typically red when ripe. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its morphological similarities with other Rubus species, it is often challenging to identify without botanical expertise."
