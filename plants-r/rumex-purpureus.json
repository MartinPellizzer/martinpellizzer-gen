    "intro": "Rumex purpureus, commonly known as red sorrel, is a flowering plant in the family Polygonaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive reddish stems and heart-shaped leaves with a sour taste due to its high oxalic acid content. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on slender spikes. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been naturalized in various regions around the world. Rumex purpureus is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is sometimes considered a weed."
