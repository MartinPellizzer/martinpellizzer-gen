    "intro": "Rhinanthus asperulus grex illyricus, commonly known as the Illyrian blazing star, is a flowering plant native to the Balkan Peninsula. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its bright orange-red flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands. Its ornamental value has made it a subject of interest in horticulture and botanical studies."
