    "intro": "Roezliella dilatata, commonly known as the broadleaf roezliella, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family, which includes many epiphytic and terrestrial species. The plant is characterized by its broad, strap-like leaves that form a rosette, often with a waxy coating to retain moisture. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, emerging from the center of the leaf rosette. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Roezliella dilatata is considered a species of conservation concern."
