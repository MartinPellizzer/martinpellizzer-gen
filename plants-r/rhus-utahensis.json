    "intro": "Rhus utahensis, commonly known as Utah raspwort, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are an important food source for wildlife. Rhus utahensis is adapted to harsh, dry environments and is often found in rocky soils and sagebrush habitats. Its botanical features make it a resilient and ecologically significant species in its native range."
