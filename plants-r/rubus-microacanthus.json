    "intro": "Rubus microacanthus, commonly known as the small-spined blackberry, is a species of brambles native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, dark red berries that ripen in the fall. The plant has trifoliate leaves with serrated edges and produces white flowers in the spring. It thrives in woodland areas and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in certain regions."
