    "intro": "Rhabdodendron arirambae, commonly known as the Ariramba's rhabdodendron, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Sri Lanka. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in dense forest undergrowth. Its flowers, which bloom in spring, are usually pink or red, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
