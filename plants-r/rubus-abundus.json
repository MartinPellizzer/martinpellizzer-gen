    "intro": "Rubus abundus, commonly known as the abundant raspberry, is a species of brambles native to temperate regions. It is characterized by its trailing or shrub-like growth habit and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces edible berries that are typically red, though some varieties may have yellow or orange hues. These berries are rich in vitamins and antioxidants, making them valuable both nutritionally and commercially. Rubus abundus thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth."
