    "intro": "Rubus nigroviridis, commonly known as the black-veined raspberry, is a species of brambles native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and thorny stems, which are typical of many Rubus species. The leaves are trifoliate, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes reddish underside. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red when ripe, though they may vary in color depending on the variety. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
