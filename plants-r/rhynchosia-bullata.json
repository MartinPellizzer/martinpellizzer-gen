    "intro": "Rhynchosia bullata, commonly known as the Bullate Cowpea, is a leguminous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its distinctive, inflated pods that resemble small horns, hence its common name. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers, which are often clustered in racemes. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets. Rhynchosia bullata is valued for its edible seeds and its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it an important crop in sustainable agriculture."
