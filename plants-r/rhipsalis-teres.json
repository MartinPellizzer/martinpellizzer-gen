    "intro": "Rhipsalis teres, commonly known as the compact rat-tail cactus, is a species of cactus native to Brazil. It is characterized by its short, branching stems that are covered in small, white spines. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in the winter months. Its compact growth habit makes it well-suited for indoor cultivation. Rhipsalis teres thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
