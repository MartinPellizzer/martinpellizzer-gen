    "intro": "Ranunculus villosus subsp. fibrillosus, commonly known as the hairy buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features delicate, yellow flowers with five petals and a hairy stem that distinguishes it from other ranunculus species. The leaves are typically palmately lobed and covered in fine, soft hairs, contributing to its characteristic appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens."
