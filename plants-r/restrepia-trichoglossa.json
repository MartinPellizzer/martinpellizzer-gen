    "intro": "Restrepia trichoglossa, commonly known as the golden rosette orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, compact rosette of fleshy, dark green leaves that store water, adapting it to its arid or semi-arid habitat. The plant produces striking yellow to orange flowers with a distinctive trichoglossa structure, which is a specialized feature in the orchid family. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires periods of dryness followed by cool, moist conditions to trigger flowering. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is a subject of interest in both horticulture and botanical research."
