    "intro": "Rosa tomentosa var. resinosa, commonly known as the resinous blusher rose, is a shrub-like plant native to the eastern Himalayas. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant produces rose hips that are covered in a sticky, resinous substance, which gives it its common name. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in forested areas at higher elevations. Due to its ornamental value and unique characteristics, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
