    "intro": "Rubus tenacellus, commonly known as the creeping raspberry, is a perennial shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, red or yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces small, edible berries that are typically sour but can be used in jams and preserves. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Rubus tenacellus is often found in woodland areas and along riverbanks, where it spreads via its stolons."
