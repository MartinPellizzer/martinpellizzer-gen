    "intro": "Rosa rubiginosa var. triflora, commonly known as the shrub rose or the red-stemmed rose, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces rose hips, which are the fruit containing the seeds, and these hips are often used in herbal teas. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for coastal and dry climates. Its botanical features include pinnately compound leaves and a woody structure that supports its growth habit."
