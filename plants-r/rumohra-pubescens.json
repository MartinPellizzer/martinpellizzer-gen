    "intro": "Rumohra pubescens, commonly known as the hairy fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its dense, hairy fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its fronds are usually pinnately compound, with small, ovate leaflets arranged along a central axis. Rumohra pubescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
