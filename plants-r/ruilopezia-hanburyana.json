It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, greenish-white flowers.

Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
