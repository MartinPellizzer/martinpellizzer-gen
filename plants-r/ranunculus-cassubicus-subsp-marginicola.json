    "intro": "Ranunculus cassubicus subsp. marginicola, commonly known as the marginal buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in meadows, woodland edges, and stream banks. The plant features compound leaves with serrated edges and bright yellow flowers with five petals. It blooms from late spring to early summer, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
