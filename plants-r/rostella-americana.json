    "intro": "Rostella americana, commonly known as the American rosette plant, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its rosette growth habit, with tightly packed, fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are succulent and can store water, allowing it to thrive in dry conditions. Rostella americana is typically found in sandy or rocky soils in open woodlands and along stream banks."
