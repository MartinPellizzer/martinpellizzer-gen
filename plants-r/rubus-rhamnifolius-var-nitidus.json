    "intro": "Rubus rhamnifolius var. nitidus, commonly known as the glossy bramble, is a shrub native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, shiny leaves that are often densely covered with fine hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by red, hairy berries. It thrives in woodland edges and disturbed soils, preferring partial shade to full sun. Its thorny stems and aromatic foliage make it a distinctive and sometimes invasive species in its native range."
