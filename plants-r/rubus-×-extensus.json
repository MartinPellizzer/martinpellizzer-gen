    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 extensus, commonly known as the evergreen blackberry, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between the common blackberry (Rubus fruticosus) and the evergreen bramble (Rubus ulmifolius). It is characterized by its dense, thorny growth habit and is native to parts of Europe and western Asia. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically harvested in late summer. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a source of edible fruit."
