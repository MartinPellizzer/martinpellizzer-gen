    "intro": "Ranunculus lappaceus var. subsericeus, commonly known as the hairy water crowfoot, is a herbaceous perennial native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features delicate, trifoliate leaves with a distinctive hairy texture, and its flowers are typically bright yellow with five petals. The plant thrives in moist, often aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats, such as pond margins and wet meadows. Its flowers bloom from late spring to early summer, and it is often found in shallow water or along stream banks. The subspecies subsericeus is distinguished by its more densely hairy stems and leaves compared to the typical form."
