    "intro": "Ranunculus accessivus, commonly known as the lesser celandine, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves and bright yellow flowers with numerous petals, typically blooming in early spring. The plant prefers moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and along streambanks. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a persistent weed in some areas. The flowers attract pollinators such as bees and flies, contributing to its ecological role in its native habitat."
