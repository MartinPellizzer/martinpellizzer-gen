    "intro": "Rubus oegocladus, commonly known as the alpine raspberry, is a species of bramble native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its erect or scrambling growth habit, with thorny stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits known as berries, which are typically red when mature. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
