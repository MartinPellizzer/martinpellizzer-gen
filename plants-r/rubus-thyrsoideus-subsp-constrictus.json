    "intro": "Rubus thyrsoideus subsp. constrictus, commonly known as the narrowleaf blackberry, is a shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It features compound leaves with three to five leaflets, typically arranged in a whorled pattern along the stems. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are usually dark purple to black when mature. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and streamside areas. Its botanical characteristics make it distinct from other Rubus species, particularly in its leaf morphology and fruit structure."
