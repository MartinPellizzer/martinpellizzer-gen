    "intro": "Rubus pennus, commonly known as the blackberry bramble, is a species of shrub in the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, white flowers that give way to aggregate fruits known as berries. These berries are typically dark purple to black when ripe and are edible, though often tart. Rubus pennus thrives in temperate climates and is commonly found in woodland edges and disturbed soils."
