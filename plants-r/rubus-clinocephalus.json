    "intro": "Rubus clinocephalus, commonly known as the upright blackberry. It is a species of bramble native to eastern North America, characterized by its thorny stems and aggregate fruits. The plant produces dark purple to black berries that are edible, though often tart and less commonly cultivated than other blackberry varieties. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for wildlife and supporting pollinators."
