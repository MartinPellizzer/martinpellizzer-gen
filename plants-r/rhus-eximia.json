    "intro": "Rhus eximia, commonly known as the staghorn sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern and central United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are alternately arranged and have a serrated edge. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by red, fuzzy fruits that persist into the winter. Its bark is thick and rough, often appearing fissured, and it thrives in full sun to partial shade. Rhus eximia is commonly found in dry, rocky soils and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value."
