    "intro": "Rotala kasaragodensis, commonly known as the Kasaragod rotala, is a species of aquatic plant native to the wetlands of Kerala, India. It is characterized by its small, rounded leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stems. The plant produces tiny, floating flowers that are usually pink or white in color. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments and is often found in marshy areas. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
