    "intro": "Rosa canina f. brevipes, commonly known as the short-stemmed dog rose, is a botanical variant of the common dog rose. It is characterized by its shorter, more compact stems compared to the typical Rosa canina. The plant produces fragrant pink to white flowers, which are followed by orange-red hips, its fruit. It is native to Europe and is often found in woodlands and scrub areas. This form is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological benefits, supporting pollinators and wildlife."
