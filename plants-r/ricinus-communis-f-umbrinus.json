    "intro": "Ricinus communis f. umbrinus, commonly known as the dark red castor oil plant, is a variant of the castor oil plant characterized by its deep, almost black foliage. This cultivar exhibits striking contrast between its dark leaves and the typical orange or red seed pods. The plant is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Africa. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its dramatic appearance. The leaves are thick and leathery, with a glossy texture that enhances its visual appeal."
