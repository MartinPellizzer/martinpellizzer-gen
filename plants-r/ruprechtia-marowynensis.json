    "intro": "Ruprechtia marowynensis, commonly known as the Marowyn fern, is a rare and delicate plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its slender, arching fronds that bear small, lance-shaped leaves with a glossy, dark green surface. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are typically located on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in cool, moist environments with partial shade, making it a challenging species to cultivate outside its natural habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ruprechtia marowynensis is considered a species of conservation concern."
