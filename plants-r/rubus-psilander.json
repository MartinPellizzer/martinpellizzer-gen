    "intro": "Rubus psilander, commonly known as the alpine blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in cool, moist conditions. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are edible and have a tart flavor. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and its stems are covered in dense, prickly hairs. Rubus psilander plays an important ecological role in its native environment, providing food for wildlife and contributing to soil stabilization."
