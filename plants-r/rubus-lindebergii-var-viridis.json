    "intro": "Rubus lindebergii var. viridis, commonly known as the green-fruited raspberry, is a variant of the raspberry plant native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into edible berries, which are typically green rather than the typical red of other raspberry varieties. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and partial shade. This variant is valued for its unique fruit color and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental or culinary purposes."
