    "intro": "Rubus obscurus var. excavatus, commonly known as the narrowleaf blackberry, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, thornless stems and small, dark green leaves with a slightly serrated margin. The plant produces aggregate fruits composed of small, dark purple achenes surrounded by a fleshy, edible receptacle. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and streambanks. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
