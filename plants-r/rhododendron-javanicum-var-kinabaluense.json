    "intro": "Rhododendron javanicum var. kinabaluense, commonly known as the Kinabalu rhododendron, is a rare and endemic species found primarily in the high-altitude regions of Mount Kinabalu in Borneo. It is characterized by its evergreen foliage and showy, tubular flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant thrives in cool, moist, and shaded environments, often growing in dense forest understories. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, providing a striking contrast to its vibrant floral displays. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
