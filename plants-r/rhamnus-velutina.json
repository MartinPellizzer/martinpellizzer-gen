    "intro": "Rhamnus velutina, commonly known as the velvetleaf buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and opposite, ovate leaves that are typically hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by dark blue-black berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and stream banks. Rhamnus velutina is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting wildlife."
