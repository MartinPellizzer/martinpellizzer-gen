    "intro": "Rumex obtusifolius subsp. silvester, commonly known as silvery dock, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in woodland edges, meadows, and along stream banks. The plant features large, heart-shaped leaves with a waxy, silvery underside, which gives it its common name. Its flowers are small and clustered in spikes, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants. Silvery dock is often used in traditional herbal medicine and can be found in various habitats across its native range."
