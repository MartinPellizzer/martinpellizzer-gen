    "intro": "Rosa glauca var. nitida, commonly known as the silverleaf rose, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which gives it its common name, and its small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces thorny stems and has a compact, bushy growth habit. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. Rosa glauca var. nitida is well-suited to rocky or well-drained soils and thrives in full sun."
