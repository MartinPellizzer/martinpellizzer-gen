    "intro": "Rytidosperma lechleri, commonly known as the rubber tree, is a species native to the Amazon rainforest. It is renowned for its latex-producing capabilities, which are harvested for natural rubber. The plant belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow leaves. Its latex contains a high concentration of rubber particles, making it economically significant. However, due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it faces threats to its survival in the wild."
