It is a shrub native to the southeastern United States, characterized by its slender, often climbing stems and small, dark green leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that give way to edible, black berries. Its foliage is typically covered in fine, hooked hairs, a feature common in many Rubus species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas."
