    "intro": "Rondeletia affinis, commonly known as the velvetleaf or red velvetplant, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows up to 3 meters in height, featuring opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves with a smooth, waxy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange, often with a yellow throat, attracting pollinators like bees and hummingbirds. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, aiding in wind dispersal. Rondeletia affinis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in warm, humid climates."
