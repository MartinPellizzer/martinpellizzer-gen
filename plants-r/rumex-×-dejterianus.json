    "intro": "Rumex \u00d7 dejterianus, commonly known as the hybrid sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant that results from the cross between Rumex acetosa (common sorrel) and Rumex acetobatus (water sorrel). It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors or along stream banks. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive reddish coloration on the underside, and it produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters. Its rhubarb-like leaves are edible but contain oxalic acid, which can be toxic in large quantities. The hybrid is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in traditional medicine."
