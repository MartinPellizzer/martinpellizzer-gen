    "intro": "Rollinia brevipes, commonly known as the short-footed star-apple, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the family Myristicaceae and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and large, elliptical leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that give way to spherical, green fruits with a rough, spiky surface. The fruit matures to a yellow or orange color and is edible, though its taste is often described as bland or slightly sour. Rollinia brevipes is valued for its ornamental appeal and has some traditional uses in local cultures."
