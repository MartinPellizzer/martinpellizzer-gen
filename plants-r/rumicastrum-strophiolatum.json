    "intro": "Rumicastrum strophiolatum, commonly known as the narrowleaf burrobrush, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a dry capsule that releases tiny seeds when disturbed, aiding in its dispersal. Rumicastrum strophiolatum is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky soils and along canyon walls."
