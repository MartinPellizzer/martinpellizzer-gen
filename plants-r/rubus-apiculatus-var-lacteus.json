    "intro": "Rubus apiculatus var. lacteus, commonly known as the white-fruited blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive white or pale-colored fruits, which contrast with the typical deep purple or black berries of other Rubus species. The plant produces compound leaves with serrated edges and grows as a shrub, often found in woodland or scrub habitats. Its flowers are usually white or pink, and the plant is known for its thorny stems. This variety is valued for its unique fruit color and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental or culinary purposes."
