    "intro": "Racosperma merrickiae, commonly known as the Waratah, is a striking flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its large, showy, red or pink bracts that enclose the smaller, true flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into small, feather-like leaflets, and it produces pods that contain seeds. The Waratah is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant floral display."
