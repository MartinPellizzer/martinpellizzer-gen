    "intro": "Rubus perrobustus, commonly known as the giant blackberry, is a species of brambles native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its large, thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces dark purple to black berries that are typically larger than those of other Rubus species. These berries are edible but have a high acidity and a strong, wild flavor. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
