It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by black, oval berries that are an important food source for wildlife. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush habitats. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological contributions in arid environments."
