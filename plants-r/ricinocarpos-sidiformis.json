    "intro": "Ricinocarpos sidiformis, commonly known as the narrow-leafed rockbriar, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers followed by capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds. It is typically found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in restoration projects in degraded landscapes."
