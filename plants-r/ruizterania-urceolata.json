    "intro": "Ruizterania urceolata, commonly known as the urn-shaped orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the cloud forests of Colombia. It is characterized by its distinctive urn-shaped flower, which gives it its common name, and its striking violet to purple petals. The plant has a slender, sympodial growth habit and produces small, clustered inflorescences. Its leaves are elongated and often covered in a fine, velvety texture. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Ruizterania urceolata is considered an endangered species."
