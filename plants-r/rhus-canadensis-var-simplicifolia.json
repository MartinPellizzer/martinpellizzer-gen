    "intro": "Rhus canadensis var. simplicifolia, commonly known as smooth sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically odd-pinnate with 11 to 31 leaflets that are smooth and oval in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in panicles, followed by bright red, fuzzy berries that are a common food source for birds. Smooth sumac thrives in full sun to partial shade and is adapted to a variety of soil types, including sandy and clay soils. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
