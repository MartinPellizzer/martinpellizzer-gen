    "intro": "Rhinorchis megapotamensis, commonly known as the Amazonian orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and large, showy flowers that typically bloom in the summer months. The plant prefers humid, shaded environments and thrives in nutrient-rich soils. Its flowers are often pink or purple, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and is a subject of conservation efforts in its native range."
