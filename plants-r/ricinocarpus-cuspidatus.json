    "intro": "Ricinocarpus cuspidatus, commonly known as the narrow-leafed ricin tree, is a tropical plant belonging to the family Euphorbiaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia and is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces capsules that contain toxic seeds, which are a source of the potent toxin ricin. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its toxic properties, it is important to handle the plant with care."
