    "intro": "Ranunculus medioviridis, commonly known as the greenleaf buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It features a basal rosette of heart-shaped, dark green leaves with a distinctive waxy coating. The plant produces showy yellow flowers with five petals and numerous stamens, typical of the Ranunculaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens but is also considered a weed in some agricultural settings."
