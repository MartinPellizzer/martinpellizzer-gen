    "intro": "Ranunculus subangustifidus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of southern and eastern Asia. It features showy, yellow flowers with five broadly ovate petals and numerous stamens, typical of the Ranunculaceae family. The plant has pinnately divided, serrated leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white, waxy hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it a distinctive and ecologically important component of its native habitats."
