    "intro": "Rafflesia rochussenii, commonly known as the Rochussen's rafflesia, is a parasitic flowering plant found in the rainforests of Indonesia. It is notable for producing one of the largest individual flowers in the world, with diameters reaching up to 1 meter. The plant lacks leaves, stems, and roots, relying entirely on its host vine for nutrients. Its flowers emit a strong, foul odor resembling decaying meat, which attracts carrion flies for pollination. The species is critically endangered due to habitat loss and illegal collection."
