    "intro": "Reholttumia longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed reholttum, is a rare and unique plant species found in specific high-altitude environments. It is characterized by its elongated, slender stems and small, clustered leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, adding to its ornamental appeal. Its growth is slow and it thrives in cool, moist conditions with well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and fragile nature, it is considered a protected species in its native habitat."
