    "intro": "Rubus foliosus f. grosseserratus, commonly known as the broad-serrate bramble, is a variant of the bramble family with distinctive botanical features. It is characterized by its large, serrated leaves that are broader than those of the typical species. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by red, edible berries. Its stems are thorny and covered in fine hairs, typical of many Rubus species. This form is often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates."
