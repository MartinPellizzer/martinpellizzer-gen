    "intro": "Restrepia fritillina, commonly known as the yellow lady's slipper orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It is characterized by its striking yellow and green flowers, which resemble a slipper in shape. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and requires well-drained conditions to thrive. Its roots are often covered in a dense network of mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption. Restrepia fritillina is a relatively rare and endangered species, making it a subject of conservation interest."
