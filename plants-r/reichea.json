    "intro": "Reichea, commonly known as the \"Andes giant\" or \"Andean tree,\" is a unique member of the Podocarpaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and dense, evergreen foliage. The plant is native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. Reichea species typically grow in rocky, well-drained soils and are adapted to harsh, cold climates. Its botanical features make it an important subject in the study of high-altitude plant adaptations."
