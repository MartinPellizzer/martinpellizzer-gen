    "intro": "Ranunculus cabrerensis, commonly known as the alpine buttercup, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its bright yellow petals and a central cluster of stamens, typical of the Ranunculaceae family. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sunlight. Its flowers bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully develop. Ranunculus cabrerensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant, delicate blooms."
