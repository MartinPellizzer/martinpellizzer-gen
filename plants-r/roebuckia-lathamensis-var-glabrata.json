    "intro": "Roebuckia lathamensis var. glabrata, commonly known as the smooth roebuckia, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and produces showy, yellow-orange inflorescences. The leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, though the varietal name \"glabrata\" suggests a smoother texture compared to other varieties. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscapes. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
