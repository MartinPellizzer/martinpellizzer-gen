    "intro": "Rosa dumalis var. scabrata, commonly known as the rough-stemmed wild rose, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its thorny stems and small, fragrant pink or white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are alternate, pinnately compound, and covered with fine, stiff hairs, giving the plant a rough texture. Its fruit is a red, hairy rose hip that matures in the fall, containing seeds inside. This species is adapted to rocky and arid environments, making it a hardy and resilient plant."
