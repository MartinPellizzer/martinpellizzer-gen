    "intro": "Rosa pycnantha, commonly known as the golden bush or the Australian waratah, is a shrub native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its striking golden-yellow flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant features small, leathery leaves and produces small, berry-like fruits that are edible for some animals. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardiness in coastal and dry environments. Rosa pycnantha is also valued for its ability to attract birds and other wildlife."
