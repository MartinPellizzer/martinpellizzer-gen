    "intro": "Roupala pamplonensis, commonly known as the Pampas rosewood, is a small evergreen tree native to South America, particularly Argentina and Uruguay. It belongs to the family Proteaceae and is characterized by its dense, aromatic wood that is highly valued for its durability and fine grain. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid climates. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a leathery texture, while its flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences. Due to its slow growth and limited natural range, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
