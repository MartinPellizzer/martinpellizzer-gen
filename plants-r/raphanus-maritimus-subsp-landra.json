    "intro": "Raphanus maritimus subsp. landra, commonly known as the coastal radish, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments. It possesses fleshy, cylindrical roots that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in coastal areas with high salinity. The plant typically grows in sandy or muddy soils along shorelines, where it tolerates periodic flooding and strong wave action. Its leaves are broad and succulent, reducing water loss in arid conditions. The species is an important part of the intertidal ecosystem, providing habitat and food for various marine and terrestrial organisms."
