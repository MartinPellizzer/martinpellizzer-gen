    "intro": "Rosa agrestis f. parvifolia, commonly known as the dwarf field rose, is a compact, shrub-like plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, thorny stems and dark green, trifoliate leaves that are typically smaller than those of the typical Rosa agrestis. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or as a border plant. Its ornamental value is complemented by its hardiness and ability to attract pollinators."
