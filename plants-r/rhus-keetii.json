    "intro": "Rhus keetii, commonly known as the Keetii sumac, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 feet and features compound leaves with three to five leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are followed by red, fuzzy berries that attract birds and other wildlife. Rhus keetii is often found in moist, open woods and along stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it an important species for ecological studies and native plant landscaping."
