    "intro": "Rosa pomifera lusus lagenarius, commonly known as the giant rose or the giant fruiting rose, is a rare and unusual variant of the Rosa genus. It is characterized by its large, fleshy, fruit-like structures that resemble berries, which are not typical of most rose species. These structures are actually modified flowers that have developed into swollen, fleshy organs, a trait known as pseudofruit. The plant is native to certain regions of Southeast Asia and is often found in tropical or subtropical climates. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is considered a botanical curiosity and is of interest to taxonomists and horticulturists."
