    "intro": "Rosa \u00d7 centifolia var. minor, commonly known as the miniature garden roses, is a hybrid rose species prized for its compact growth and abundant blooms. It is characterized by its multiple layers of fragrant, pink petals that resemble the full-size Centifolia roses but on a smaller scale. This variety thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular pruning to maintain its shape and encourage repeat flowering. It is often used in garden borders, containers, and as a decorative element in floral arrangements. Due to its delicate appearance and strong fragrance, it is a popular choice for both ornamental and perfumery purposes."
