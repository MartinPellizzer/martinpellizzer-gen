    "intro": "Rubus compactus f. bellardii, commonly known as the Bellard's blackberry, is a compact shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, thorny growth habit and small, dark purple berries that ripen in late summer. The plant has trifoliate leaves with serrated edges and produces white to pale pink flowers in the spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and thickets. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and edible fruits, though it is less commonly cultivated than other blackberry species."
