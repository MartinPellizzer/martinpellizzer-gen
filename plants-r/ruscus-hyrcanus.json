    "intro": "Ruscus hyrcanus, commonly known as Persian spurge, is a perennial shrub native to parts of Central Asia and the Middle East. It belongs to the family Asphodelaceae and is characterized by its compact growth habit and fleshy, scale-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in late spring or early summer. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a resilient plant in arid environments. Ruscus hyrcanus is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in dry, rocky soils."
