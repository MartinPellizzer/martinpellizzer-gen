    "intro": "Rennellia borneensis, commonly known as the Bornean rennellia, is a flowering plant native to the island of Borneo. It belongs to the family Arecaceae, which includes palms, and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate leaves. The plant produces inflorescences that bear both male and female flowers, typical of many palm species. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
