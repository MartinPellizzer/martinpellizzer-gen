    "intro": "Rhododendron mishmiense, commonly known as the Mishmi rhododendron, is a species native to the eastern Himalayas, particularly in the states of Arunachal Pradesh and Assam in India. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments at high altitudes. The plant is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range in color from pink to deep red, often with a distinctive hairy texture. Its leaves are elliptical and leathery, providing a dense canopy that contributes to the undergrowth of its habitat. Rhododendron mishmiense plays an important ecological role in its native region, supporting various wildlife species and contributing to the biodiversity of the area."
