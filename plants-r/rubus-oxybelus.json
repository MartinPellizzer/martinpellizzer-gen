    "intro": "Rubus oxybelus, commonly known as the sharp-fruited blackberry, is a species of bramble within the Rubus genus. It is native to the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon, where it thrives in coastal and mountainous regions. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically tart and less sweet than other blackberry varieties. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the stems are covered in persistent, stiff bristles. The plant is valued for its ornamental value and is also used in local ecosystems as a food source for wildlife."
