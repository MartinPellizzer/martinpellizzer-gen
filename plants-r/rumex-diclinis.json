    "intro": "Rumex diclinis, commonly known as the two-rowed sorrel, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Polygonaceae family, which includes other familiar plants like buckwheat and sorrel. The plant features alternate, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly rough texture. Its flowers are small and clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences, with separate male and female flowers on different plants, a characteristic known as dioecy. The plant is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks."
