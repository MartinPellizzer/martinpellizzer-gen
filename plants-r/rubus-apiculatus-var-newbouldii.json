It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant produces edible berries that are typically red or black in color, though they are often bitter and not widely consumed. It thrives in moist, woodland environments and is often found in areas with acidic soils.
