    "intro": "Rumex acetosa var. ovalifolius, commonly known as sour dock, is a perennial plant belonging to the Polygonaceae family. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a powdery coating. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are greenish-white in color, often appearing in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and along stream banks. The leaves and stems are edible but can be quite tart, and the plant has been used historically in traditional medicine."
