    "intro": "Rafflesia speciosa, commonly known as the giant floral parasite, is a unique plant species found in the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is a parasitic plant that lacks leaves, stems, and roots, relying entirely on its host plant for nutrients. The plant is famous for producing the world's largest individual flower, which can reach up to 1 meter in diameter. Its vivid red petals are often adorned with a strong, unpleasant odor resembling rotting meat, which attracts pollinators like flies. Due to its specialized habitat and threats from deforestation, Rafflesia speciosa is considered a rare and endangered species."
