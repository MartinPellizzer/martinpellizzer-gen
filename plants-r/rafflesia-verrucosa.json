    "intro": "Rafflesia verrucosa, commonly known as the\u75a3\u72b6\u5927\u738b\u82b1, is a parasitic flowering plant native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is renowned for producing one of the largest individual flowers in the world, which can reach diameters of up to 1 meter. The plant lacks true leaves, stems, and roots, relying entirely on its host plant for nutrients. Its flowers emit a strong, foul odor reminiscent of decaying flesh, which attracts carrion-eating insects for pollination. The plant's unique botanical features make it a fascinating subject in the study of parasitic flora and evolutionary adaptations."
