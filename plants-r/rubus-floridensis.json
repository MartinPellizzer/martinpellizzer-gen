    "intro": "Rubus floridensis, commonly known as the Florida blackberry, is a species of brambles native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that ripen to a dark purple or black color. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in swamps and along stream banks. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
