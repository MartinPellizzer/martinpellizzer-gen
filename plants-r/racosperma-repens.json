    "intro": "Racosperma repens, commonly known as the wandering acacia, is a shrub native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems that grow along the ground, often forming dense mats. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typical of the legume family. Its leaves are bipinnate, consisting of multiple small leaflets, and it has small, bean-like pods that contain seeds. Racosperma repens is adapted to arid environments and is often found in sandy or rocky soils."
