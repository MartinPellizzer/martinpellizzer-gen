    "intro": "Rapuntium lukwangulense, commonly known as the Lukwangulense cress, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Korean Peninsula. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes other cruciferous plants such as mustard and cabbage. The plant is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in shades of white and purple. Its leaves are edible and have a peppery flavor, similar to that of watercress. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native environment."
