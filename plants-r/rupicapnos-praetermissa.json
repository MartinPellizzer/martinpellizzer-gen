It features opposite, ovate leaves that are typically dark green with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped white flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries in the fall. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for woodland gardens and naturalistic landscapes."
