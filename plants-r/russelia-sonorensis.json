    "intro": "Russelia sonorensis, commonly known as the Sonoran Russelia, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to drought conditions. The plant produces clusters of showy, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. Its leaves are usually small, narrow, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Russelia sonorensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in desert ecosystems."
