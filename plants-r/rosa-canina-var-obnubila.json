    "intro": "Rosa canina var. obnubila, commonly known as the narrow-leaved dog rose, is a variant of the dog rose native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of fragrant pink flowers that bloom in spring. The leaves are typically narrower and more elongated compared to the standard Rosa canina, giving it a distinct appearance. Its fruits, known as hips, are orange-red and contain numerous small seeds, often used in traditional herbal remedies. This plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological importance in supporting pollinators and wildlife."
