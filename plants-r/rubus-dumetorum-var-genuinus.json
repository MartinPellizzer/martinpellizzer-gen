    "intro": "Rubus dumetorum var. genuinus, commonly known as the alpine blackberry, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and small, dark purple to black berries that ripen in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and cool climates. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it produces white to pale pink flowers in early spring. This variety is valued for its hardiness and is often used in ecological restoration projects in high-altitude areas."
