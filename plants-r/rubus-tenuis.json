It is characterized by its slender, trailing stems and small, trifoliate leaves with finely toothed margins. The plant produces small, dark purple berries that are typically less than 1 centimeter in diameter. It is native to the eastern United States and thrives in moist, shaded environments. Due to its delicate structure and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
