    "intro": "Rubus ossicus, commonly known as the Tibetan raspberry, is a species of bramble native to the high altitudes of the Tibetan Plateau. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or black in color. It thrives in cold, arid environments and is adapted to high-altitude conditions. Due to its unique habitat, it plays an important role in the local ecosystem and has limited commercial use."
