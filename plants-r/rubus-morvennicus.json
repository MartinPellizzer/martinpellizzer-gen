    "intro": "Rubus morvennicus, commonly known as the Morven raspberry, is a species of bramble native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red when ripe. The plant has trifoliate leaves with serrated margins and produces white flowers with five petals. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
