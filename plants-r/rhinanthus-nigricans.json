    "intro": "Rhinanthus nigricans, commonly known as the black knapweed, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. The plant has a slender, branching stem covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a hairy texture. It thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats such as roadsides and waste areas. Rhinanthus nigricans plays a role in supporting pollinators, particularly bumblebees, due to its nectar-rich flowers."
