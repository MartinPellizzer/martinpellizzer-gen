    "intro": "Rodriguezia candelariae, commonly known as the Candelabra Rodriguezia, is a striking plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, branched stems that resemble a candlestick, giving it its common name. The plant produces vibrant, showy flowers that are typically red or orange, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. Its leaves are large, glossy, and often have a waxy texture, which helps it retain moisture in its native habitat. Rodriguezia candelariae is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique appearance in botanical gardens and private collections."
