    "intro": "Rosa abietina var. subbaddensis, commonly known as the Alpine rose or mountain rose, is a shrub native to the high-altitude regions of the Alps. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense foliage, with leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy. The plant produces fragrant, pink to white flowers that bloom in late summer. It is well adapted to cold climates and poor soils, often found in rocky or alpine meadows. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is cultivated in gardens in cooler regions."
