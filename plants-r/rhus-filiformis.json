    "intro": "Rhus filiformis, commonly known as the slender buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and stream banks. The plant has compound leaves with elongated, slender leaflets that give it its common name. Its small, yellowish-green flowers appear in early spring, followed by orange to red berries that are an important food source for wildlife. Rhus filiformis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native landscapes."
