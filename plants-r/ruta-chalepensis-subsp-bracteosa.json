It is characterized by its aromatic, pinnately compound leaves and small yellowish flowers that appear in spring. The plant produces small, fleshy, berry-like fruits that are typically green when immature and turn red when mature. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or dry habitats. The subspecies is distinguished by the presence of bracts beneath the flowers, which are modified leaves."
