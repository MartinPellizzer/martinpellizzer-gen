    "intro": "Rosa canina f. montivaga, commonly known as the alpine rose, is a botanical variant of the dog rose. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and smaller, more delicate flowers compared to the typical Rosa canina. This form thrives in high-altitude environments, often found in mountainous regions across Europe. Its leaves are typically smaller and more serrated, adapting to colder and harsher climates. The plant produces edible hips, similar to the common dog rose, but is less commonly cultivated due to its specific ecological requirements."
