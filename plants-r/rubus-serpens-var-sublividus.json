    "intro": "Rubus serpens var. sublividus, commonly known as the narrowleaf blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to parts of North America. It is characterized by its slender, often ascending stems and small, elliptical leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, dark purple berries that are typically less showy than those of other blackberry varieties. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
