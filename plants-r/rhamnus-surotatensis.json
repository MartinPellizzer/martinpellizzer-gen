It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its small, oval leaves and yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces small, dark berries that are an important food source for various bird species. It thrives in rocky and well-drained soils, often growing in forested or scrubland habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native range."
