    "intro": "Romulea viridis, commonly known as the green romulea, is a perennial bulbous plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its grass-like leaves and striking yellow flowers. The plant produces small, tuberous bulbs that store nutrients, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. It typically blooms in spring, with flowers that are often clustered in a loose panicle. Romulea viridis is adapted to well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and Mediterranean climates."
