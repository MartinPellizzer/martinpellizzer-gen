    "intro": "Ruschia triquetra, commonly known as the three-lobed Ruschia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features small, triangular leaves that are typically green with a reddish tinge, especially when exposed to full sun. The plant produces clusters of delicate, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or purple during the warmer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for succulent collections."
