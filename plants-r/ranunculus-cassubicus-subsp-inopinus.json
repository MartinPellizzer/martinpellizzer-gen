    "intro": "Ranunculus cassubicus subsp. inopinus, commonly known as the narrowleaf buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and stream banks. The plant features simple, alternate leaves with a distinctive leaflet arrangement, and its flowers are yellow with five petals and numerous stamens. It blooms from late spring to early summer, producing showy flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and flies. The subspecies is characterized by its narrower leaves compared to the typical form of R. cassubicus."
