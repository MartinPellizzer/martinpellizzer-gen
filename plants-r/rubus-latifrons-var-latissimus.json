    "intro": "Rubus latifrons var. latissimus, commonly known as the broad-fruited blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to certain regions of North America. It is characterized by its large, dark purple to black berries that are typically larger than those of the standard Rubus latifrons. The plant produces compound leaves with serrated edges and has thorny stems typical of the Rubus genus. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland areas or along the edges of streams. The fruit is edible, though some varieties may have a slightly bitter taste."
