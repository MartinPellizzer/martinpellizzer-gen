    "intro": "Rumex \u00d7 balatonus, commonly known as the hybrid sorrel, is a perennial plant belonging to the Polygonaceae family. It is a naturally occurring hybrid between Rumex acetosa (common sorrel) and Rumex patientia (sorrel). The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and wet meadows. Its leaves are heart-shaped with a distinctive sour taste due to high oxalic acid content. It produces small, greenish flowers in spikes during the spring and early summer."
