    "intro": "Rubus hirtus var. burnatii, commonly known as the Burnatii raspberry, is a variant of the brambles native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its erect or semi-erect growth habit and produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or dark red in color. The plant has trifoliate leaves with serrated edges and hairy stems, which are typical features of the Rubus genus. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and has limited use in commercial cultivation due to its specific environmental requirements."
