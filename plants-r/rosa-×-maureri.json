    "intro": "Rosa \u00d7 maureri, commonly known as the evergreen musk rose, is a hybrid shrub native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and dark green, leathery foliage. The plant produces fragrant, semi-double to double pink or white flowers in spring. It is evergreen, making it a popular choice for coastal gardens due to its salt tolerance. Rosa \u00d7 maureri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in hedges or as a specimen plant."
