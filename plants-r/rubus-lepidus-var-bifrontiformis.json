    "intro": "Rubus lepidus var. bifrontiformis, commonly known as the twin-faced bramble, is a shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with three to five leaflets. The plant produces small, white to pink flowers in late spring, followed by red, edible berries in the summer. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. This variety is notable for its unique leaf morphology and is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value."
