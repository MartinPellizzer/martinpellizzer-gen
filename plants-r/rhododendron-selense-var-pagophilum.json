    "intro": "Rhododendron selense var. pagophilum, commonly known as the snow-loving rhododendron, is a rare and cold-tolerant shrub native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and showy, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained acidic soil. Its flowers, typically pink or white, are adapted to attract pollinators in alpine conditions. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to climate change, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat."
