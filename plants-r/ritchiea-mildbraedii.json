    "intro": "Ritchiea mildbraedii, commonly known as the Lord Howe Island tree fern, is a unique species native to the isolated Lord Howe Island in the South Pacific. It belongs to the Cyatheaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in coastal forests and rocky outcrops. Its reproductive structures include both spores and, in some cases, small, inconspicuous flowers, though it is primarily a spore-producing plant. Due to its restricted habitat and vulnerability to environmental changes, Ritchiea mildbraedii is considered an endangered species."
