    "intro": "Rhododendron maximum f. purpureum, commonly known as the purple-leafed rhododendron, is a striking variant of the common rhododendron. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range from pink to deep purple, often with a contrasting white throat. The plant is evergreen, with leathery, elliptical leaves that turn a vibrant purple in the fall. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to form dense, bushy growth that provides both visual interest and habitat for wildlife."
