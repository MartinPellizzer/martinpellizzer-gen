It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows in moist, woodland areas. The plant produces small, yellowish-green berries that are generally unpalatable due to their bitter taste. Botanically, it belongs to the Grossulariaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. Its habitat and morphology make it an important species for ecological studies in its native range."
