    "intro": "Rubus hirtus var. prehensibilis, commonly known as the climbing raspberry, is a variant of the raspberry plant characterized by its trailing growth habit and thorny stems. It produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red when ripe, similar to other Rubus species. The plant is native to parts of Europe and Asia and thrives in temperate climates. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it often grows in woodland or hedgerow environments. This variant is notable for its ability to climb and spread through its tendrils, making it a common sight in naturalized areas."
