    "intro": "Rorippa coxii, commonly known as the narrow-leafed watercress, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic flowering plant native to parts of Asia. It typically grows in wetlands, ditches, and along the edges of water bodies, preferring moist or submerged environments. The plant has slender, branching stems and small, alternate leaves that are usually narrowly elliptic in shape. Its flowers are white or pale pink, with four petals, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds. Rorippa coxii is often found in temperate regions and can be an indicator species for certain aquatic habitats."
