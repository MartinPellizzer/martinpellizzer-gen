    "intro": "Ranunculus neumanii, commonly known as the Neuman's buttercup, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow petals and a hairy stem, typical of the Ranunculaceae family. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky habitats and is often found in mountainous regions. Its flowers bloom in early spring, and it produces small, green, oval-shaped fruits. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some areas."
