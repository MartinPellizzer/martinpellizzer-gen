    "intro": "Rhododendron \u00d7 coriifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf rhododendron, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Rhododendron catawbiense and Rhododendron maximum. It is characterized by its large, leathery, broad leaves that are typically dark green and often have a waxy coating. The plant produces showy, clustered flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its botanical features make it both ornamental and ecologically significant in its native habitats."
