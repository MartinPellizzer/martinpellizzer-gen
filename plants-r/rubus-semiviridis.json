    "intro": "Rubus semiviridis, commonly known as the greenleaf blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and trifoliate leaves that are usually a dark green color. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into edible berries, though they are generally less flavorful than other blackberry varieties. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
