    "intro": "Rubus incultus var. glaucescens, commonly known as the glaucous bramble, is a shrub native to parts of Asia, particularly China. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The leaves are typically trifoliate, with a distinctive bluish-gray pubescence that gives the plant its common name. The fruit, a small, hairy berry, is edible but often tart and less commonly consumed compared to other raspberries. This plant thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forested or rocky habitats."
