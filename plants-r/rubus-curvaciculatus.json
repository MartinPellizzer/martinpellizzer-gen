    "intro": "Rubus curvaciculatus, commonly known as the curved-stem blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, dark purple to black berries. The plant produces compound leaves with serrated edges and a generally shrub-like growth habit. It thrives in moist, wooded areas and is often found in the southeastern regions of the U.S. The fruit is edible, though it is not as widely cultivated as other blackberry species."
