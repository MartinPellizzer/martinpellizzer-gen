    "intro": "Rosa tomentella var. fischeri, commonly known as the Fischer's woolly rose, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and thorny stems, which provide protection against herbivores and harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are elliptical and covered in a fine, white pubescence, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This species is well adapted to arid and semi-arid climates, thriving in well-drained soils and full sunlight."
