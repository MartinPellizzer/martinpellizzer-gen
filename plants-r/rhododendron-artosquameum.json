    "intro": "Rhododendron artosquameum, commonly known as the alpine rhododendron, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions with well-drained soil. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, providing a striking contrast to the showy pink or red flowers. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
