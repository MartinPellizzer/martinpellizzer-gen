    "intro": "Rosa setulifera, commonly known as the bristly rose, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is native to the southern United States, particularly Texas and New Mexico, and thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in spring. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and covered with fine, bristly hairs, contributing to its common name. Rosa setulifera is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
