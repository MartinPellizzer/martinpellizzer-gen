    "intro": "Richea dracophylla, commonly known as the dragon's tail, is a shrub native to the south-western region of Western Australia. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and dark green, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine, white wax. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers during the cooler months, typically from spring to autumn. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to the dry, Mediterranean climate of its native habitat. Richea dracophylla is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in native gardens and landscapes."
