    "intro": "Rosa ursina, commonly known as the bearberry rose, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is native to parts of Europe and Asia, typically found in rocky or forested areas. The plant produces small, fragrant pink or white flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits. Rosa ursina is characterized by its low-growing habit and thorny stems, making it well adapted to its often harsh environments. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both ecological studies and horticultural cultivation."
