    "intro": "Rheum tetragonopus, commonly known as palmate rhubarb, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its large, deeply lobed leaves that resemble a palm, hence its common name. The plant produces tall, reddish stems that bear clusters of yellow flowers in the spring. Its rhubarb-like stalks are edible, though they are typically used in traditional medicine rather than culinary applications. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been cultivated for its unique foliage and medicinal properties."
