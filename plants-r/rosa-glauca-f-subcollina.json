    "intro": "Rosa glauca f. subcollina, commonly known as the subalpine rose, is a cultivar of the Rosa glauca species, which is native to the mountainous regions of Europe. This plant is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The foliage is typically dense and covered in a fine, silvery-blue bloom, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in cooler climates."
