    "intro": "Rubus peramethystinus, commonly known as the purple-stemmed blackberry, is a species of brambles native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its dark purple stems and thorny canes, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, dark berries that are typically harvested in late summer. Its leaves are trifoliate, with a serrated edge, and they have a slightly hairy texture. Rubus peramethystinus is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated for its edible fruits."
