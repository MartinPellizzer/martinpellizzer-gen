    "intro": "Ranunculus granulatus, commonly known as the granular buttercup, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, yellow flowers with 5 to 15 petals, typically arranged in a cup-like shape. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive hairy texture, and it thrives in moist, calcareous soils. It is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. The species is known for its ability to spread through rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in some areas."
