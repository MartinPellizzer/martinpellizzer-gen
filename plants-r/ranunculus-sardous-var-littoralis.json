It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers with five petals and a hairy, glandular stem. The plant thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found along shorelines and rocky coastlines. Its leaves are palmately divided and have a distinctive, waxy appearance. It plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
