    "intro": "Racapa procera, commonly known as the tall racapa, is a striking flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that can reach heights of up to 3 meters. The plant produces large, showy flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which bloom in clusters at the top of the stem. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving them a soft, fuzzy texture. Racapa procera is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to grow in high-altitude, sunny environments."
