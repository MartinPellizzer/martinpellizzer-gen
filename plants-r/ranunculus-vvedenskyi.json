    "intro": "Ranunculus vvedenskyi, commonly known as the Siberian buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features striking yellow flowers with five to nine petal-like sepals, which are often mistaken for true petals. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils. Its leaves are deeply divided and covered in a fine layer of hairs, and it produces a cluster of small, yellow flowers in early summer. This species is notable for its medicinal properties and has been used in traditional herbal remedies."
