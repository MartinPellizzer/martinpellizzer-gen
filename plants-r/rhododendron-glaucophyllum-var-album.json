It is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia, particularly in countries like China, Myanmar, and India. This evergreen shrub is characterized by its dense foliage and showy white or pale pink flowers that bloom in spring. The leaves are typically leathery and glossy, providing a striking contrast to the pale blossoms. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in temperate climates."
