    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus subsp. protendens, commonly known as the broad-leaved buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It features showy, yellow flowers with five broad, petal-like sepals that are often reflexed backward. The plant has palmately divided leaves that are typically lobed and covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. The subspecies is distinguished by its larger, more robust leaves compared to the typical form of Ranunculus auricomus."
