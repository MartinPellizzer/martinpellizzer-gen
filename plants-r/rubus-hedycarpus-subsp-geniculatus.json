    "intro": "Rubus hedycarpus subsp. geniculatus, commonly known as the creeping blackberry, is a shrub native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and thorny stems, which help it spread along the ground. The plant produces small, dark red to black berries that are typically eaten by birds and other wildlife. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it has a fibrous root system that allows it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. This subspecies is often found in forest understories and is valued for its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
