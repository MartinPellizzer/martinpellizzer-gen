    "intro": "Rubus arduennensis, commonly known as the Arduennian blackberry, is a species of brambles native to the humid forests of the Atlantic coast of France. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species within its native habitat."
