    "intro": "Raphanus sativus var. roseus, commonly known as the rose radish, is a cultivar of the wild radish species. It is characterized by its distinctive pink or red root, which is smaller and more rounded than the typical radish. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, adding ornamental value to gardens. Its leaves are edible and have a peppery flavor similar to other radishes. This variety is often grown for both its aesthetic appeal and mild, crunchy taste."
