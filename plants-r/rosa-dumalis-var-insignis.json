    "intro": "Rosa dumalis var. insignis, commonly known as the alpine rose, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features upright stems with dense, dark green foliage and produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit and is well adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in cooler climates."
