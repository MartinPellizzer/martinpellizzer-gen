    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 illicitus, commonly known as the hybrid blackberry-loganberry, is a deciduous shrub belonging to the Rosaceae family. It is a natural hybrid between Rubus ursinus (blackberry) and Rubus loganobaccus (loganberry), resulting in a plant with unique botanical characteristics. The plant produces large, dark red to black berries that are typically larger and sweeter than its parent species. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it has thorny stems typical of many Rubus species. This hybrid is often cultivated for its fruit, which is prized in both culinary and commercial applications."
