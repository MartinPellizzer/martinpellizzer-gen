    "intro": "Rumex cassius, commonly known as broad-leaved dock, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its roots are thick and fleshy, often used in traditional medicine for their astringent properties. Rumex cassius thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in wet meadows."
