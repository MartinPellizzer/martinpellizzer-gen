    "intro": "Rubus jaysmithii var. angustior, commonly known as the narrowleaf blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry genus native to specific regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, angular leaves and small, dark red to black berries that ripen in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland edges and stream banks. Its flowers are white and clustered in dense inflorescences, and the plant is often found in association with other shrubs in its habitat. The fruit is edible but generally less palatable than other blackberry varieties."
