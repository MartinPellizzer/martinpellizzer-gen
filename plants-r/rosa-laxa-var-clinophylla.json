    "intro": "Rosa laxa var. clinophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved dog\u73ab\u7470, is a species of flowering plant in the rose family. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves and clusters of pink to red flowers. Native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, this variety thrives in cooler, well-drained soils. The plant is often found in rocky or alpine habitats, where it forms dense, low-growing mats. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in gardens, though it requires specific conditions to flourish."
