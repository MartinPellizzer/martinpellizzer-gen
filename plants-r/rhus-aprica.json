    "intro": "Rhus aprica, commonly known as smooth sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and turn bright red in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in catkins, followed by orange-red, spiny fruits that contain one seed each. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, often found in dry woodlands and open fields. Rhus aprica is notable for its ornamental value and its role in supporting local wildlife."
