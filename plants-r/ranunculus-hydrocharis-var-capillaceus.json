    "intro": "Ranunculus hydrocharis var. capillaceus, commonly known as the water buttercup, is a aquatic plant characterized by its delicate, floating leaves and yellow flowers. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. The plant's leaves are usually divided into small, thread-like segments, giving it a feathery appearance. Its flowers are typically borne on long, slender stems and bloom in early summer. This variety is notable for its ability to spread through both vegetative reproduction and seed dispersal."
