    "intro": "Rubus menkei var. pseudomuricatus, commonly known as the prickly rose or mock blackberry, is a shrub native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in wetlands and along stream banks, thriving in moist, acidic soils. The plant features thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. Its flowers are white or pale pink, and it produces small, edible berries that are often used in jams and preserves. This variant is closely related to other Rubus species but is distinguished by its unique morphology and habitat preferences."
