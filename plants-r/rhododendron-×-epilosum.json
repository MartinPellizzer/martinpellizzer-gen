    "intro": "Rhododendron \u00d7 epilosum, commonly known as the creeping rhododendron, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Rhododendron ferrugineum and Rhododendron caucasicum. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit, with evergreen foliage that is typically dark green and leathery. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often appearing in late spring. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to form thick ground cover, suppressing weeds and stabilizing soil in natural habitats."
