    "intro": "Rubus lobayensis, commonly known as the Lobay blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves, typical of the Rubus genus. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are highly valued for their flavor and nutritional content. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in rocky or mountainous terrain. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
