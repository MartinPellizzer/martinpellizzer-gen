    "intro": "Rubus mutabilis var. regnorum, commonly known as the Everchanging Bramble, is a shrub native to the temperate regions of the Pacific Northwest. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which have a distinctive silvery-white underside and dark green upper surface. The plant produces small, edible berries that change color as they ripen, transitioning from white to red to black. Its thorny stems provide structural support and deter herbivores. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
