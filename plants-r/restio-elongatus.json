    "intro": "Restio elongatus, commonly known as the long-stemmed restio, is a member of the Restiaceae family, characterized by its grass-like appearance and unique floral structures. It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in coastal and sandy environments. The plant features slender, often branched stems with small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets. Its leaves are narrow and fibrous, contributing to its structural strength and resilience. Restio elongatus plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and provides habitat for various small invertebrates."
