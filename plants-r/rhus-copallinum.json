    "intro": "Rhus copallinum, commonly known as the sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and turn a striking red color in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in upright clusters, followed by red, fuzzy fruits that contain one or two seeds. Its roots and leaves contain toxic compounds, making it potentially harmful if ingested. Rhus copallinum is often found in dry, open woods and is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
