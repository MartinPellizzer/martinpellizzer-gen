    "intro": "Rosa kokelii, commonly known as the Kokelii rose, is a rare and unique species native to the island of Socotra. It is characterized by its distinctive, spiny stems and large, velvety leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white, which bloom in late spring. It thrives in arid and rocky environments, showcasing its adaptation to the harsh climate of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Rosa kokelii is considered a vulnerable species."
