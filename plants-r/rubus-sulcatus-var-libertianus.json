    "intro": "Rubus sulcatus var. libertianus, commonly known as the Libertian blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to Central America. It is characterized by its thorny stems and trifoliate leaves, typical of the Rubus genus. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are often used in local culinary traditions. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soil and partial shade. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species within its native range."
