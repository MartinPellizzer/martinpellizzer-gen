    "intro": "Rumex thyrsiflorus var. mandshurica, commonly known as the Siberian sorrel, is a perennial herb native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are often reddish or purple-veined. The plant produces dense clusters of small, greenish flowers in terminal spikes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or wet meadows. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats."
