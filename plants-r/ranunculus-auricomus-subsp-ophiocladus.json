It is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its bright yellow flowers with five petal-like sepals. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are palmately divided, and the flowers bloom in early spring. The subspecies ophiocladus is distinguished by its more robust growth and slightly different leaf morphology compared to the typical form of R. auricomus."
