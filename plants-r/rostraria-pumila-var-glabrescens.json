It belongs to the family Ericaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant features hairy stems that become smooth as the plant matures, giving it its varietal name. Its leaves are typically narrow and linear, adapted to withstand cold and windy conditions. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in tundra and rocky habitats."
