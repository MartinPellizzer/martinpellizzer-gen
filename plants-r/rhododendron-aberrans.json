    "intro": "Rhododendron aberrans, commonly known as the Himalayan rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Asia, including parts of India, Nepal, and Bhutan. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and showy, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments at high altitudes, often in forest understories. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, providing a striking contrast to its vibrant blooms. Rhododendron aberrans is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological systems of its native habitats."
