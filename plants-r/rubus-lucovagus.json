    "intro": "Rubus lucovagus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf blackberry, is a species of bramble native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black when mature. It thrives in woodland edges and moist, well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
