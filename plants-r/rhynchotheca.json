    "intro": "Rhynchotheca, commonly known as the \"spiny bladder,\" is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, spiny capsules that enclose the seeds, providing protection and aiding in seed dispersal. The plants are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, often in moist, shaded environments. Rhynchotheca species are shrubs or small trees with alternate, ovate leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers. Their botanical features make them notable in ecological and horticultural contexts."
