    "intro": "Ruta montana, commonly known as mountain rue, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its aromatic, dark green leaves with serrated edges and small yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant contains toxic compounds, including rutin and various alkaloids, which can be harmful if ingested. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or coastal areas. Its historical use in herbal medicine and as a garden plant is notable, though caution is advised due to its toxicity."
