    "intro": "Rhus bicolor, commonly known as the two-colored sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves that turn a striking red or orange in the fall, and its small, bright red berries that are a food source for birds. The plant thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or along roadsides. It has a distinctive, aromatic sap that can cause skin irritation in some individuals. Rhus bicolor is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it a valuable plant in ecological restoration projects."
