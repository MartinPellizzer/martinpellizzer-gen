    "intro": "Rubus splendidus var. aberrans, commonly known as the aberrant bramble, is a rare and distinctive variant of the Rubus genus. It is characterized by its strikingly large, showy flowers that are typically pink or white in color. The plant exhibits unique morphological features, including elongated leaves and thornless stems, which set it apart from other Rubus species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
