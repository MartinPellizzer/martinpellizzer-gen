    "intro": "Roegneria glabrispicula, commonly known as the smooth-spurred wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, glabrous (hairless) leaf blades. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences with small, pale green to yellowish florets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Roegneria glabrispicula is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing rocky and arid landscapes."
