    "intro": "Rhododendron ferrugineum var. album, commonly known as the white heather, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its clusters of small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in early spring. The leaves are leathery, dark green, and covered with a fine, rusty-colored down, giving the plant its species name \"ferrugineum.\" This variety is particularly noted for its striking white blooms, which contrast beautifully with its dark foliage. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in heathland and moorland environments."
