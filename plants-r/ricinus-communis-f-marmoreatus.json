    "intro": "Ricinus communis f. marmoreatus, commonly known as the variegated castor bean, is a striking ornamental plant characterized by its unique foliage. Its leaves are large, palmate, and display a marbled pattern of green, cream, and sometimes reddish tones. The plant is a cultivar of the common castor bean, which is native to Africa but is widely cultivated for its ornamental value. It thrives in warm climates and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its toxic seeds, it should be handled with care and kept away from children and pets."
