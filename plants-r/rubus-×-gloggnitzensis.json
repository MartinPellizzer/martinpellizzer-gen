    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 gloggnitzensis, commonly known as the Gloggnitz raspberry, is a hybrid species within the Rubus genus, native to Central Europe. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red when ripe. The plant features trifoliate leaves with serrated edges and thornless stems, making it distinct from many other raspberry species. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and small-scale agriculture."
