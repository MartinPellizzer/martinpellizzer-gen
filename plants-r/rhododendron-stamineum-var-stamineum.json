    "intro": "Rhododendron stamineum var. stamineum, commonly known as the Chinese rhododendron, is a flowering plant native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and showy, bell-shaped flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink, red, and white. The plant thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to form compact shrubs with a broad, rounded shape. Additionally, it is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its use in traditional Chinese medicine."
