    "intro": "Ranunculus cortusifolius var. villosus, commonly known as the woolly water crowfoot, is a perennial aquatic plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in shallow freshwater habitats such as ponds, streams, and ditches. The plant features finely divided, feathery leaves that are covered in a dense layer of soft, white hairs, giving it a woolly appearance. Its small, yellow flowers bloom in early spring, often appearing before the leaves fully develop. The species is characterized by its delicate, floating or submerged growth habit and its preference for nutrient-rich, still or slow-moving waters."
