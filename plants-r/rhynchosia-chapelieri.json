    "intro": "Rhynchosia chapelieri, commonly known as the Cape York burr legume, is a flowering plant native to northern Australia. It is a shrub that typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is well adapted to arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, followed by woody pods that contain several seeds. Its distinctive feature is the presence of a hooked spur at the base of each flower, which is a characteristic feature of the genus Rhynchosia. The plant is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for local wildlife."
