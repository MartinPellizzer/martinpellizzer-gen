    "intro": "Rhamnus infectoria f. genuina, commonly known as the narrowleaf buckthorn, is a shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically less than 2 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by dark blue-black berries that are an important food source for birds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and thickets. Its botanical features make it a distinctive member of the Rhamnaceae family."
