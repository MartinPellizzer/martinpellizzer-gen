    "intro": "Rubus calvus f. calviformis, commonly known as the smooth-stemmed blackberry, is a botanical variant of the blackberry plant characterized by its smooth, hairless stems. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is native to regions of North America. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically smaller than those of the typical Rubus calvus. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas. This form is valued for its unique morphology and is sometimes cultivated for its fruit."
