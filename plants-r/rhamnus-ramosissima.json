    "intro": "Rhamnus ramosissima, commonly known as the creosote bush, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, sprawling growth habit and its ability to thrive in harsh, dry environments. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Its yellow flowers appear in clusters and are followed by small, fleshy berries that are a food source for various animals. The creosote bush is also known for its strong, aromatic resin, which contributes to its common name."
