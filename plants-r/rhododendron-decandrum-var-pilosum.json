    "intro": "Rhododendron decandrum var. pilosum, commonly known as the hairy-stemmed rhododendron, is a shrub native to the eastern Himalayas. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. The leaves are typically leathery and have a hairy texture, which gives the plant its varietal name. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in mountainous regions with acidic soils. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant floral display."
