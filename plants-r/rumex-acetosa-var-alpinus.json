It features upright, hairy stems and trifoliate leaves with serrated edges, adapted to cold and rocky environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, typically blooming in early summer. Its leaves are edible and have a sour taste due to high oxalic acid content. It is often found in alpine meadows and is valued for its culinary and medicinal uses."
