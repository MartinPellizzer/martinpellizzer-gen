    "intro": "Rhinanthus angustifolius var. bosniacus, commonly known as the Bosnian narrow-leaved yellowtop, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and the Balkans. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, characterized by its hemiparasitic nature, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients. The plant typically grows in grasslands and open woodlands, featuring slender stems and small, yellow-orange flowers. Its leaves are narrow and linear, and it blooms from June to August. This variety is distinguished by its geographic distribution and specific floral morphology compared to other Rhinanthus species."
