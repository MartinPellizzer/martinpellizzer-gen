    "intro": "Rubus innominatus subsp. plebejus, commonly known as the common blackberry bramble, is a shrub native to eastern North America. It typically grows in moist, wooded areas and thrives in partial to full shade. The plant produces small, dark purple berries that are edible and often used in jams and desserts. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it has thorny stems that help in its identification. This subspecies is closely related to other Rubus species and plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for wildlife."
