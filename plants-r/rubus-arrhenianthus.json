    "intro": "Rubus arrhenianthus, commonly known as the male raspberry, is a species of bramble native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or black when mature. Unlike its female counterpart, it does not produce seeds, relying instead on vegetative propagation. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats."
