    "intro": "Robinia cyanescens, commonly known as the blue acacia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves that turn a striking blue-green color in the fall, adding ornamental value to the landscape. The plant produces fragrant, yellow flowers in late spring, which are followed by long, flat pods containing seeds. Its root system is deep and fibrous, making it drought-tolerant and adaptable to various soil types. Robinia cyanescens is also valued for its hard, heavy wood, which has been used historically for tool handles and other small crafts."
