    "intro": "Rumex \u00d7 schlagintweitii, commonly known as the hybrid sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Polygonaceae family. It is a naturally occurring hybrid between Rumex acetosa (common sorrel) and Rumex acetobulus (bitter sorrel), resulting in a plant with characteristics of both parents. The leaves are typically heart-shaped, with a reddish or purple coloration on the veins, and the plant produces small, greenish flowers in dense clusters. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in wet meadows, stream banks, and other damp habitats. Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits genetic variability and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
