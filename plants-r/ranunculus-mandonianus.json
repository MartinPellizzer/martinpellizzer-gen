    "intro": "Ranunculus mandonianus, commonly known as the Mandon's buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family, characterized by its showy, often brightly colored flowers. The plant typically features palmate leaves with lobed segments and produces flowers with five to eight sepals that resemble petals. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
