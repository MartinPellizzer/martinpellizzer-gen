    "intro": "Rosa pimpinellifolia var. mathonnetii, commonly known as the Mathonnet's rock rose, is a rare and delicate shrub native to the limestone cliffs of southern France. It features small, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white, often with a hint of yellow at the base. The plant has narrow, upright leaves that are covered in fine hairs, adapted to thrive in harsh, sunny conditions. Its flowers are typically borne singly or in pairs, adding a subtle ornamental value to its natural habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
