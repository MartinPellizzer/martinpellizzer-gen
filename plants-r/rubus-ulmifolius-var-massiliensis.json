It is characterized by its large, dark purple to black berries that are typically more robust than those of the standard species. The plant features thorny stems and broad, three-lobed leaves with a serrated edge. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in hedgerows and woodland edges. This variety is valued for its hardy nature and is sometimes cultivated for its edible fruits."
