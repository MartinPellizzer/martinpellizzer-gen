    "intro": "Rubus hadrocarpus, commonly known as the giant blackberry. It is a species of bramble native to New Zealand, characterized by its large, thorny stems and dark purple to black berries. The plant produces aggregate fruits composed of small, achenes surrounded by a fleshy receptacle. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forested areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in regions outside its native range."
