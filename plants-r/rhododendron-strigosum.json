It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its dense, leathery leaves and clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments at high elevations, often growing in rocky or forested areas. Its flowers range in color from white to pink and are often adorned with a distinctive hairy covering.
