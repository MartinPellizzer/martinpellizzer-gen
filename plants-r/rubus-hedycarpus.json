    "intro": "Rubus hedycarpus, commonly known as the sweetbriar rose, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, white or pink flowers. The plant produces aggregate fruits, known as drupes, which are typically red or yellow when mature. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with serrated margins, and it often grows in woodland or hedgerow environments. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in hedging and as a source of edible berries."
