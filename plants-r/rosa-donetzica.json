    "intro": "Rosa donetzica, commonly known as the Donets Basin rose, is a rare and endangered species native to the Donets Basin in Ukraine. It is a shrub-like plant with thorny stems and small, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant's leaves are alternate, pinnately compound, and have a rough texture. Its flowers are typically pink to red in color, with five petals and a strong, sweet fragrance. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Rosa donetzica is critically threatened and requires conservation efforts to survive."
