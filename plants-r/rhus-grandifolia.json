    "intro": "Rhus grandifolia, commonly known as the smooth sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and have 11 to 31 leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by red, fuzzy berries that attract birds and other wildlife. Rhus grandifolia thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a common sight in woodland edges and disturbed areas."
