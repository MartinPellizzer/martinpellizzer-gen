    "intro": "Rosa cuspidatoides var. erioclada, commonly known as the woolly rose, is a shrub-like plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and thorny stems, which provide protection against herbivores. The leaves are typically elliptical and covered in a fine, white pubescence, giving the plant a soft, fuzzy appearance. Its flowers are usually pink or red, with five to seven petals, and bloom in early to mid-summer. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique texture and color."
