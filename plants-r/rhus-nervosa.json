    "intro": "Rhus nervosa, commonly known as the smooth sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically pinnately arranged with 11 to 31 leaflets. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by red, fuzzy berries that attract birds and other wildlife. Its bark is smooth and grayish, and it thrives in a variety of soil types, including dry to moist conditions. Rhus nervosa is often found in woodlands, thickets, and along stream banks, making it a common sight in the eastern U.S. ecosystem."
