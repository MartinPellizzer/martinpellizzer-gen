    "intro": "Renealmia dermatopetala, commonly known as the red-tongue fern, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its striking, bright red rhizomes that contrast with its green fronds. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sporangia on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistent moisture and well-draining soil. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in warm climates."
