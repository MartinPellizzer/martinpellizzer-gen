    "intro": "Rhynchospora globularis var. obliterata, commonly known as the globular spikerush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its dense, globular inflorescence that consists of numerous small, spike-like clusters of flowers. The plant typically grows in marshy areas, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its leaves are grass-like, narrow, and often slightly hairy, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This variety is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
