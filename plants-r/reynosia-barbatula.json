    "intro": "Reynosia barbatula, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a species of flowering plant in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. Its flowers are small and clustered in cyathia, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family, and are usually yellow-green in color. Reynosia barbatula is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and competitive nature."
