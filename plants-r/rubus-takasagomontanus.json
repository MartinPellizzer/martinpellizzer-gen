    "intro": "Rubus takasagomontanus, commonly known as the Japanese blackberry, is a species of bramble native to Japan. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or black in color. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland areas. Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in regions outside its native habitat."
