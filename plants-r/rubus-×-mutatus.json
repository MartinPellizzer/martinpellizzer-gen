    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 mutatus, commonly known as the blackberry raspberry, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Rubus ursinus (the blackberry) and Rubus chamaemorus (the cloudberry). It is a perennial shrub that produces edible berries with a unique flavor profile combining the tartness of raspberries with the richness of blackberries. The plant typically grows in moist, temperate climates and thrives in well-drained soil. Its flowers are usually pink or white, and it is known for its vigorous growth habit. The fruit is often used in jams, desserts, and beverages due to its high acidity and aromatic qualities."
