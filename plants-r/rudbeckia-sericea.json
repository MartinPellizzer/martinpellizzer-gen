    "intro": "Rudbeckia sericea, commonly known as silverleaf coneflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its hairy, silver-gray foliage and bright yellow to orange flower heads that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 2 to 4 feet and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its flowers are composed of a central disk surrounded by ray florets, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Rudbeckia sericea is often found in prairies, open woods, and along roadsides, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
