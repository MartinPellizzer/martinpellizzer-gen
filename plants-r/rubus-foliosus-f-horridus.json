This plant is native to parts of eastern North America and thrives in moist, wooded areas. Its leaves are typically lobed and have a rough texture, contributing to its common name. The flowers are small, white, and clustered in racemes, producing edible berries that are often used in local cuisine. It plays an important ecological role by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
