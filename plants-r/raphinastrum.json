    "intro": "Raphinastrum, commonly known as the common ragwort, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its yellow flowers and hairy stems, often found in disturbed soils and open habitats. The plant typically grows in temperate regions and is known for its toxic properties, particularly in its leaves and stems. Raphinastrum species are often considered invasive in certain areas, outcompeting native vegetation. Its ecological impact is significant, both as a weed and as a food source for specific insects."
