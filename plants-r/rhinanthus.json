    "intro": "Rhinanthus, commonly known as the common tickseed, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Orobanchaceae. These plants are hemiparasitic, meaning they partially rely on other plants for water and nutrients through their root systems. Rhinanthus species are typically found in open habitats such as grasslands and heaths, where they bloom with bright yellow or orange flowers. The genus includes several species, with Rhinanthus minor being one of the most widespread in Europe. Their unique ecological role makes them important indicators of habitat quality and biodiversity."
