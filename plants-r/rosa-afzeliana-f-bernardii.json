It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense foliage, with flowers that are typically pink to red in color. The plant produces fragrant, semi-double blooms that are often clustered together, adding visual interest to gardens. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or borders. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a valuable species for botanical conservation efforts."
