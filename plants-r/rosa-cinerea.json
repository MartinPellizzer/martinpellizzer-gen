    "intro": "Rosa cinerea, commonly known as the gray rose, is a species native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its pale grayish-green foliage and clusters of small, fragrant pink flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub, reaching heights of up to 2 meters, and is well adapted to cool, moist environments. Its stems are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which gives it its distinctive silvery appearance. Rosa cinerea is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique aesthetic."
