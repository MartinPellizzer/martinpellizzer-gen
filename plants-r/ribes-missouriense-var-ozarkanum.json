    "intro": "Ribes missouriense var. ozarkanum, commonly known as Ozark gooseberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the central United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 5 to 9 leaflets, and its clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces edible berries that ripen to a bright red color in late summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas and along streambanks. Ozark gooseberry is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
