    "intro": "Rhododendron fulgens, commonly known as the flame azalea, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that range in color from white to deep red, often with a yellow or orange throat. The plant typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 feet and produces fragrant blooms in the spring. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and glossy, providing a striking contrast to the vibrant flowers. Rhododendron fulgens thrives in partial to full shade and well-drained acidic soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens."
