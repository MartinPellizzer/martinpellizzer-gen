It is characterized by its evergreen foliage and showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in acidic, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, providing a striking contrast to its vibrant blooms. Rhododendron glabriflorum is often found in forests and shrublands at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters."
