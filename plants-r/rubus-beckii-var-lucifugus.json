    "intro": "Rubus beckii var. lucifugus, commonly known as the moonflower raspberry, is a shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is characterized by its thorny stems and dense clusters of small, white flowers that bloom at night. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible but often have a tart flavor. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in forest understories. Its unique flowering pattern and habitat preferences make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
