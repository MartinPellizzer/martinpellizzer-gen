    "intro": "Rosa glutinosa subsp. pustulosa, commonly known as the sticky rose or pustular rose, is a shrub-like species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The flowers are typically pink to red, with five petals and a strong, sweet fragrance. This subspecies is known for its sticky secretions, which can attract pollinators and deter herbivores. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal environments."
