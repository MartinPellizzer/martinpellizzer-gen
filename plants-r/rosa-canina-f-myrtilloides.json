    "intro": "Rosa canina f. myrtilloides, commonly known as the blackberry rose, is a botanical variant of the dog rose. It is characterized by its dark purple to black fruits, which are typically smaller and more intensely flavored than those of the typical Rosa canina. The plant produces fragrant, pink to white flowers in early summer, followed by the development of its distinctive berries. It is a shrub native to Europe and parts of western Asia, often found in woodland edges and hedgerows. This form is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional herbal medicine."
