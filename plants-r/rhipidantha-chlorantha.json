    "intro": "Rhipidantha chlorantha, commonly known as the green-stemmed mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that thrives on the branches of host trees. It possesses small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically a bright green color, contributing to its name. The plant produces white or pale yellow flowers, which are often clustered in small inflorescences. Its berries are usually red or orange, containing seeds that are dispersed by birds. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly affect the health of its host tree if left unchecked."
