    "intro": "Rubus pluralis, commonly known as the many-fruited blackberry, is a species of bramble native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that ripen to a deep purple-black color. It thrives in woodland areas and along stream banks, preferring moist, well-drained soils. Rubus pluralis is valued for its edible berries and its role in supporting local wildlife."
