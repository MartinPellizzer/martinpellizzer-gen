    "intro": "Rapistrum strictissimum, commonly known as rigid wild mustard, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of 30\u2013100 cm, with hairy stems and alternate, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its seeds are enclosed in pods that split open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind. Rapistrum strictissimum is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in agricultural fields."
