    "intro": "Ruppia maritima proles brevirostris, commonly known as the narrow-beaked sea rocket, is a flowering plant belonging to the family RuppIaceae. It is a halophyte, meaning it thrives in saline environments such as coastal marshes and estuaries. The plant has small, green, succulent leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer. Its seeds are dispersed by water, allowing it to colonize new areas along shorelines. This species plays an important role in stabilizing coastal sediments and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
