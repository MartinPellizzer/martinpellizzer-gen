    "intro": "Rhamnus oleoides var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf buckthorn, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dark green, oval leaves that are typically broad and leathery in texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by small, round berries that are rich in mucilage. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments. Due to its hardiness, it is sometimes used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to tolerate harsh conditions."
