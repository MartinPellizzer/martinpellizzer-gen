    "intro": "Rubus sciaphilus f. microphyllus, commonly known as the shade-loving raspberry, is a unique variant of the raspberry genus characterized by its small, delicate leaves. It thrives in shaded environments, often found in forest understories where light is limited. The plant produces small, usually red or yellow fruits that are less commonly consumed by humans compared to other raspberry species. Its foliage is densely packed, which helps it conserve moisture and withstand low-light conditions. This form is particularly interesting for botanists studying plant adaptations to shaded habitats."
