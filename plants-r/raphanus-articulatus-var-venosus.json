    "intro": "Raphanus articulatus var. venosus, commonly known as the veiny radish, is a variant of the common radish characterized by its distinctive veined leaves. It is an annual herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with serrated, lobed leaves that are often covered in a fine, hairy coating. Its flowering stems produce small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by round, reddish-brown seed pods. This variety is cultivated for its edible roots and leaves, which have a slightly spicy flavor similar to other radish species."
