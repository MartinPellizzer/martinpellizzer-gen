It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves and showy, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in mountainous regions with acidic soils and high humidity. Its flowers, which range in color from white to pink, bloom in late spring to early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
