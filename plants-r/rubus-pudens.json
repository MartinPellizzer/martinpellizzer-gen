    "intro": "Rubus pudens, commonly known as the shy raspberry, is a species of bramble native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and small, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces edible berries that are typically small and tart, similar to other Rubus species. Its leaves are compound, with three to five leaflets, and the plant has thorny stems typical of the Rubus genus. It thrives in moist, wooded areas and is often found in the understory of forests."
