    "intro": "Rubus vulgaris var. radula, commonly known as the blackberry shrub, is a species of bramble native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and aggregate fruits, which are typically dark purple to black when ripe. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by the development of its edible berries. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, loamy soils. The leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the plant is often found in hedgerows, woodlands, and disturbed areas."
