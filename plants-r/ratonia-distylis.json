    "intro": "Ratonia distylis, commonly known as the two-styled ratonia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink. Its two distinct styles in the pistil are a notable botanical feature, contributing to its unique reproductive strategy.
