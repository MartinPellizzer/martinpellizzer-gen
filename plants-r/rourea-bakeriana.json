    "intro": "Rourea bakeriana, commonly known as the Baker's rourea, is a species of flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to several meters. Its leaves are usually leathery and have a glossy texture, which helps it retain moisture in its native arid environments. Rourea bakeriana is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
