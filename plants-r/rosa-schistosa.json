It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in countries like Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Tibet. The plant is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit, with thorny stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets, and the plant is adapted to grow in rocky, arid environments. Rosa schistosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and attractive blooms."
