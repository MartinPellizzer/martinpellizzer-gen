    "intro": "Roystonea hispaniolana, commonly known as the Hispaniolan royal palm, is a striking member of the Arecaceae family native to the island of Hispaniola. This tall, slender palm can reach heights of up to 20 meters, featuring a slender trunk covered in smooth, fibrous bark. Its palmate leaves are large, feather-like, and arranged in a rosette at the top of the stem. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that develop into clustered fruits, each containing a single dark brown seed. Roystonea hispaniolana is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in tropical landscapes."
