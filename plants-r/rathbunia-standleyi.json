    "intro": "Rathbunia standleyi, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. The plant is known for its hard, durable wood, which has been historically valued for its use in furniture and construction. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland forests. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered an endangered species."
