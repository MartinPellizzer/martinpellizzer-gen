    "intro": "Rubus candicans subsp. neomalacus, commonly known as the red-fruited raspberry, is a shrub native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red when ripe, though they may vary in color depending on the variety. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and thickets. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and edible berries, though its fruits are generally less tart than those of other raspberry species."
