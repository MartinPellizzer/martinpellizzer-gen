    "intro": "Rubus rivularis f. grandibracteosus, commonly known as the large-bract raspberry, is a variant of the common raspberry native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a shrub characterized by its arching canes and compound leaves with serrated margins. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red when ripe, though they may vary in color depending on the variety. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or along stream banks. The large bracts that give it its name are prominent and contribute to its ornamental value."
