    "intro": "Rosa canina f. oeniriparia, commonly known as the blackberry rose, is a botanical variant of the dog rose. It is characterized by its dark purple to black fruits, which are typically smaller and more intensely flavored than those of the typical Rosa canina. The plant produces pink to red flowers, which bloom in spring and are followed by the development of its distinctive berries. It is a shrub that thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges or hedgerows. The fruit of this variety is not only ornamental but also edible, though it is generally less commonly consumed than the common blackberry."
