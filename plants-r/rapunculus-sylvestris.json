    "intro": "Rapunculus sylvestris, commonly known as the wild cuckoo's beak, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Brassicaceae. It is a biennial plant that typically grows in moist, woodland habitats across Europe and parts of Asia. The plant features basal leaves that are lobed and hairy, with a distinctive flowering stem that bears clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers. Its flowers are hermaphroditic, meaning they have both male and female reproductive structures, and are pollinated by insects. The plant produces small, round, green fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals."
