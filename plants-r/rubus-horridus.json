    "intro": "Rubus horridus, commonly known as brambles or blackberries, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers in the spring, which are followed by edible berries in the summer. Rubus horridus is native to Europe, Asia, and North America, and it thrives in a variety of soil types. Its berries are widely used in culinary applications, though the plant itself can be invasive in certain regions."
