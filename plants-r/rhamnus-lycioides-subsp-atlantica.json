    "intro": "Rhamnus lycioides subsp. atlantica, commonly known as the Atlantic buckthorn, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its dense, thorny growth habit and small, dark green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in the spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for birds. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with high salinity and wind exposure. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and coastal landscapes."
