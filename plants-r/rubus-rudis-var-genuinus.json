    "intro": "Rubus rudis var. genuinus, commonly known as the slender blackberry. It is a shrub native to parts of Asia, characterized by its thorny stems and small, dark purple berries. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and its flowers are white with five petals. The berries are edible when ripe, though they are generally smaller and less sweet compared to other blackberry varieties."
