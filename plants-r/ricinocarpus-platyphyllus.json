    "intro": "Ricinocarpus platyphyllus, commonly known as the broad-leaf ricin tree, is a species of flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a large, deciduous tree that can grow up to 30 meters tall, characterized by its broad, flat leaves and showy yellow flowers. The plant produces woody pods containing seeds with a toxic protein called ricin, which makes it potentially hazardous. Botanically, it belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is notable for its ecological and historical significance in traditional medicine and as a source of natural toxins."
