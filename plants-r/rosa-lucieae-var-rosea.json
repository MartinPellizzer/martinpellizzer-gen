    "intro": "Rosa lucieae var. rosea, commonly known as the Lucie's rose, is a hybrid rose species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and profuse display of semi-double, pink to red flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces fragrant, velvety petals with a subtle scent, and its foliage consists of dark green, serrated leaves. It is typically propagated through cuttings or grafting due to its limited natural seed production. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to well-drained, sunny conditions."
