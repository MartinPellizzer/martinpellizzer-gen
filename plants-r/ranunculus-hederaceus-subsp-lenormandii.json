    "intro": "Ranunculus hederaceus subsp. lenormandii, commonly known as the Alpine buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its basal rosette of heart-shaped, hairy leaves and produces showy yellow flowers with prominent black markings. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and alpine meadows. It has a fibrous root system and is adapted to cool, temperate climates. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain areas."
