    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus subsp. brachyphyllarius, commonly known as the narrow-leaf buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features showy, yellow flowers with five to seven petal-like sepals and numerous stamens, typical of the Ranunculaceae family. The subspecies is distinguished by its shorter, more compact leaves compared to the typical auricomus, with a broader base and a more rounded tip. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. The plant is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its bright, cheerful blooms."
