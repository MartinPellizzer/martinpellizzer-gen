    "intro": "Ricinodendron tomentellum, commonly known as the woolly sycamore, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves that are covered in a dense, woolly pubescence. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody, spiny fruits containing seeds. Its bark is thick and fissured, often exuding a milky latex when damaged. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
