It is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree with smooth, greyish bark and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or red in color, which bloom in spring. These flowers give way to dark purple or black berries that are edible but have a tart flavor. It thrives in coastal areas and is often found in heathlands and rocky soils."
