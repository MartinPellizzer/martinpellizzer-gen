    "intro": "Restrepia aberrans, commonly known as the aberrant restrepia, is a species of orchid native to the Andean regions of South America. It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its dense, fibrous root system and its ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant produces striking, elongated pseudobulbs that support its evergreen foliage. Its flowers are typically pale green to yellowish in color, with a distinctive, spurred lip that aids in pollination. Restrepia aberrans is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts for its unique appearance and resilience."
