It is characterized by its smaller, more elongated leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant produces small, tart red berries that are typically harvested in late summer. It is well adapted to salty air and sandy soils, making it a hardy species in maritime climates. This form is often found in dunes and coastal woodlands, contributing to the ecological stability of these habitats."
