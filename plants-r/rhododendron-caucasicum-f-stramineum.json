    "intro": "Rhododendron caucasicum f. stramineum, commonly known as the Caucasian yellow rhododendron, is a rare and ornamental plant native to the Caucasus region. It is characterized by its striking yellow to orange flowers, which are typically borne in clusters and bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has lance-shaped, leathery leaves that are dark green and often covered in a fine, silvery down. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Due to its limited natural range and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a valuable but challenging plant for cultivation."
