    "intro": "Ranunculus prorsidens, commonly known as the upright buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a short, stout rhizome and produces erect, hairy stems that bear palmately divided leaves with serrated edges. The plant is characterized by its showy, yellow flowers with five to nine petals, which are typically borne on long, slender pedicels. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely commercialized."
