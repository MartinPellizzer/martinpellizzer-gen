    "intro": "Rubus tomentosus f. cinereus, commonly known as the silver-haired raspberry, is a variant of the brambles native to North America. It is characterized by its soft, silvery-white pubescence that covers the stems and leaves, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or yellow in color, which are edible but often tart. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its botanical features make it a notable species in ecological studies and horticultural interest."
