    "intro": "Rhamnus subsempervirens, commonly known as evergreen buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It features simple, alternate leaves that are typically elliptical or ovate in shape, with a glossy, dark green upper surface and a lighter, hairy underside. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by black, egg-shaped berries that are an important food source for birds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it a notable species in ecological studies and native plant landscaping."
