It is a hybrid species within the Rubus genus, characterized by its distinctive white or pale pink flowers that contrast with its dark, thorny stems. The plant produces small, edible berries that are similar to other blackberries but often have a milder flavor. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland areas or along the edges of thickets. Its botanical interest lies in its hybrid origins and unique floral characteristics."
