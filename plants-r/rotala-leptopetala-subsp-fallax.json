    "intro": "Rotala leptopetala subsp. fallax, commonly known as the fallax water hyacinth, is a semi-aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It features floating leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a waxy surface and a distinctive reddish or purple underside. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically borne in spikes, which are often submerged or just barely above the water surface. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments and is often found in ponds, lakes, and wetlands. Due to its rapid growth rate, it can become invasive in certain regions if not managed properly."
