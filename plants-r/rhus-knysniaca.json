    "intro": "Rhus knysniaca, commonly known as the Knysna yellowwood, is a deciduous tree native to the coastal regions of South Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, light grey bark and compound leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by edible, red berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in sandy soils and is often found in coastal forests and along the shores of the Knysna estuary. Due to its ecological importance and ornamental value, it is a notable species in South African botany."
