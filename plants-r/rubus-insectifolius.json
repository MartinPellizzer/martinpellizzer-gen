    "intro": "Rubus insectifolius, commonly known as the insect-leaf raspberry, is a species of brambles native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its slender, often thornless stems and compound leaves that resemble insect wings, giving it its unique common name. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or yellow in color, similar to other raspberry species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in horticultural settings."
