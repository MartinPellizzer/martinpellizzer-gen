    "intro": "Rubus werdensis, commonly known as the Werdens' bramble, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia, particularly in countries like Vietnam and Cambodia. The plant is characterized by its thorny stems, compound leaves, and clusters of small white or pink flowers. Its fruits, which are edible, are similar to raspberries in texture but have a distinct flavor. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Rubus werdensis is considered a rare and endangered species."
