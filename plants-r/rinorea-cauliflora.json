    "intro": "Rinorea cauliflora, commonly known as the caladium plant, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, colorful, heart-shaped leaves that are often used as ornamental foliage. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that appear at the base of the stem, a trait known as cauliflorous flowering. Rinorea cauliflora thrives in warm, humid environments and is often cultivated for its decorative leaves rather than its flowers. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for shaded garden spaces."
