    "intro": "Rhamnus \u00d7 woloszczakii, commonly known as the hybrid common buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its smooth, often thornless stems and opposite, simple leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by dark blue, waxy berries that are a key feature of its reproductive cycle. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions and is often found in woodland edges or hedgerows. This species is notable for its adaptability and is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions."
