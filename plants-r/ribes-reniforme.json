    "intro": "Ribes reniforme, commonly known as the roundleaf currant, is a deciduous shrub native to North America. It belongs to the Grossulariaceae family and is characterized by its oval, waxy leaves that are often mistaken for those of the gooseberry. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are followed by edible, red berries that ripen in late summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is cultivated in gardens and used in native plant restoration projects."
