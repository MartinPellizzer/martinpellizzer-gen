    "intro": "Rhynchostigma parviflorum, commonly known as the small-flowered rhynchostigma, is a member of the Rubiaceae family. It is a small, herbaceous plant characterized by its delicate, opposite leaves and clusters of tiny, white to pale pink flowers. Native to tropical regions of Africa, it thrives in shaded, moist environments. The plant has a short stem and produces small, elliptical fruits that contain minute seeds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and less-studied species."
