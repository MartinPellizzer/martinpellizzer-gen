    "intro": "Rapunculus, commonly known as buttercup, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Brassicaceae. These plants typically have basal leaves that are lobed or divided, and they produce showy, yellow or white flowers with five petals. The flowers are often accompanied by a cluster of small, yellowish sepals that form a cup-like structure. Rapunculus species are often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils across temperate regions. They are known for their attractive appearance and are sometimes cultivated as ornamental plants."
