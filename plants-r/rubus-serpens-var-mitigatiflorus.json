    "intro": "Rubus serpens var. mitigatiflorus, commonly known as the soft-flowered blackberry vine, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to certain regions of South America. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and thorny stems, typical of the Rubus genus. The leaves are compound, with three to five leaflets, and the flowers are small, white or pale pink, with a distinctive, soft appearance. The fruit, a dark purple to black berry, is edible and often used in jams and desserts. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and mild flavor compared to other blackberry species."
