    "intro": "Rhytidophyllum minus, commonly known as the small barkless cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Cycadaceae and is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring a short, unbranched stem and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant is notable for its lack of a true bark, which distinguishes it from other cycad species. It produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Rhytidophyllum minus is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change."
