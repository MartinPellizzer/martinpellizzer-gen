    "intro": "Rubus fuscus var. mucronulatus, commonly known as the short-tipped blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is a shrub that produces small, dark purple to black berries, which are typically less flavorful compared to other blackberry varieties. The plant has compound leaves with serrated edges and produces white to pink flowers in the spring. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland areas or along hedgerows. The berries are used in some culinary applications, though they are not as widely cultivated as other blackberry types."
