    "intro": "Robinia acacia, commonly known as the honeylocust, is a deciduous legume native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves that turn yellow in the fall and its distinctive thorned stems. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in late spring, which are followed by flat, pod-like fruits. Robinia acacia has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion. It is often used in landscaping due to its ornamental value and adaptability to various soil types."
