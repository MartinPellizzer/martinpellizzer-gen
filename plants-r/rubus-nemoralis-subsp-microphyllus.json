    "intro": "Rubus nemoralis subsp. microphyllus, commonly known as the small-leaved blackberry, is a shrub native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically grows in woodland edges, hedgerows, and disturbed soils, preferring partial shade to full sun. The plant produces small, dark red to black berries that are edible but often tart in flavor. Its leaves are trifoliate, with small, elliptical leaflets, and the stems are thorny. The species is notable for its horticultural value and ecological role in supporting pollinators and wildlife."
