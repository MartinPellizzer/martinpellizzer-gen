    "intro": "Rubus thyrsoideus var. tumidus, commonly known as the inflated blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant characterized by its distinctive, swollen fruiting stems. It is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States, typically found in moist, wooded areas. The plant produces dark purple to black berries that are slightly larger and more rounded than those of the typical blackberry. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the plant has thorny stems typical of the Rubus genus. The botanical features of this variety make it a notable species in both ecological and horticultural contexts."
