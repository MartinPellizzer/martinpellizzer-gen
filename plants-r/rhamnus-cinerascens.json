    "intro": "Rhamnus cinerascens, commonly known as the ash-leafed buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows to a height of 2\u20135 meters and has dark green, oval-shaped leaves that turn reddish in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by dark blue berries that are attractive to birds. Its bark is grayish and becomes fissured with age, and it is often found in rocky or dry soils. Rhamnus cinerascens is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
