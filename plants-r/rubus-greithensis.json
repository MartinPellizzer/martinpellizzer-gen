    "intro": "Rubus greithensis, commonly known as the Greith's bramble, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central America, particularly in countries like Guatemala and Honduras. The plant is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, white to pink flowers that bloom in the spring. Its leaves are trifoliate, with a serrated margin, and the fruit is a aggregate of small drupes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Rubus greithensis is considered a rare and relatively understudied species."
