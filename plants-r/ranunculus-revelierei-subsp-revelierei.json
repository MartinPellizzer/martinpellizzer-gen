It features showy, bright yellow flowers with five to seven petals, typically blooming in early spring. The plant has palmately lobed leaves that are covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats, where it contributes to the biodiversity of its environment. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it requires specific growing conditions to flourish."
