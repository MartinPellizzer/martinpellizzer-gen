    "intro": "Rhynchospora polyphylla var. brunnescens, commonly known as the brown-stem sedges, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and other moist habitats, exhibiting a clump-forming growth habit. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences with pale green to brownish flowers. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, contributing to its presence in wetland ecosystems. The varietal name *brunnescens* refers to its distinctive brownish stem color, which sets it apart from other varieties of *Rhynchospora polyphylla*."
