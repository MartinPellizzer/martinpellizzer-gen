    "intro": "Rhinanthus ovifugus subsp. songeonii, commonly known as the Korean yellow rattle, is a flowering plant native to Korea. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients through its root system. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and forest edges. Its subspecific name, *songeonii*, honors the Korean botanist Songeon, reflecting its regional significance in botanical studies."
