    "intro": "Rafnia alpina, commonly known as the alpine rafnia, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Its leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss. Rafnia alpina is often found in alpine meadows and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in mountain ecosystems."
