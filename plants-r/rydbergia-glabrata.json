    "intro": "Rydbergia glabrata, commonly known as the smooth Rydberg grass, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are smooth to the touch. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle of small, spikelet-like flowers. Rydbergia glabrata is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and ability to stabilize soil."
