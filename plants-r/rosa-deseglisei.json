    "intro": "Rosa deseglisei, commonly known as the Desert Rose, is a species of flowering plant native to the arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, pink or white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through its deep root system and thick, waxy leaves that reduce water loss. It is often found in rocky soils and can thrive in full sun. Rosa deseglisei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapes due to its low water requirements."
