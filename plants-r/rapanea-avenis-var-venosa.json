    "intro": "Rapanea avenis var. venosa, commonly known as the variegated holly, is a shrub native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves with striking white or yellow variegation. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that are followed by red, fleshy berries. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and hardy nature. The variegation in its leaves is due to a genetic mutation that affects chlorophyll production."
