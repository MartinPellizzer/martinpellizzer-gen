It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, commonly referred to as the sedge family, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, ribbed leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically clustered at the tips of the stems. Rhynchospora parviflora thrives in moist, acidic soils and plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and wetland conservation efforts."
