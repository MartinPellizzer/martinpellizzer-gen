    "intro": "Rhus \u00d7 pulvinata, commonly known as the staghorn sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are alternately arranged and have a serrated margin. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red, fuzzy berries in the fall. Its bark is thick and rough, with a distinctive, scaly texture that gives it its common name. Rhus \u00d7 pulvinata is often found in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and in woodland edges."
