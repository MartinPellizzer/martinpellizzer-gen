    "intro": "Rhododendron longiperulatum, commonly known as the long-stemmed rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, preferring acidic soil conditions. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, often with a slight waxy coating. Rhododendron longiperulatum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in cooler, humid climates."
