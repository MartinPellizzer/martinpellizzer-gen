    "intro": "Rumex \u00d7 cacozelus, commonly known as the hybrid sorrel, is a naturally occurring hybrid between Rumex acetosa (common sorrel) and Rumex patientia (woolly sorrel). It is a perennial herb characterized by its distinctive heart-shaped leaves with a reddish coloration on the underside. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a persistent weed in agricultural and disturbed areas. The leaves are edible but contain high levels of oxalic acid, which can be toxic in large quantities."
