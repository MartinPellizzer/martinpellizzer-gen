    "intro": "Ryania pyrifera, commonly known as the red rye plant, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. Its fruits are dry, capsule-like structures that contain numerous tiny seeds. Ryania pyrifera has been studied for its potential medicinal properties, particularly due to the presence of alkaloids in its leaves."
