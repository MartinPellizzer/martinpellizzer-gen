It features a basal rosette of heart-shaped leaves and produces showy yellow flowers with five petals. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It has a fibrous root system and is often found in clusters, giving it its common name. The flowers bloom in spring and are pollinated by insects, making it an important part of early-season ecosystems."
