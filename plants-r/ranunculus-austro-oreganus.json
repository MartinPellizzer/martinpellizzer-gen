    "intro": "Ranunculus austro-oreganus, commonly known as the Oregon buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its showy, yellow flowers with five to seven petals and a hairy, upright stem. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its leaves are trifoliate, with lobed segments, and it produces small, greenish-brown fruits that disperse its seeds. Ranunculus austro-oreganus is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in local ecosystems by supporting pollinators."
