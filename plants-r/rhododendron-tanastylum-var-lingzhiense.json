    "intro": "Rhododendron tanastylum var. lingzhiense, commonly known as the Lingzhi Rhododendron, is a rare and ornamental shrub native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and showy, clustered flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing vibrant pink to red blossoms that attract pollinators. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable but endangered species in its native range."
