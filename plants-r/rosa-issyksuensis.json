It is characterized by its fragrant, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has slender, thorny stems and dark green, serrated leaves. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
