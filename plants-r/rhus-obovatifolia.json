    "intro": "Rhus obovatifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It features compound leaves with ovate to lanceolate leaflets that are typically arranged in pairs along the stem. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are followed by red, fuzzy fruits that persist into winter. Rhus obovatifolia is characterized by its aromatic, pinnately compound leaves and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types. It is often found in woodland edges, thickets, and disturbed sites, contributing to local biodiversity."
