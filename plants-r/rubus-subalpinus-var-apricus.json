    "intro": "Rubus subalpinus var. apricus, commonly known as the alpine raspberry, is a flowering plant species native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and hairy stems. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or yellow in color, which are edible and often used in local cuisines. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates, making it a common sight in alpine and subalpine ecosystems. Due to its hardiness, it plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing food for wildlife."
