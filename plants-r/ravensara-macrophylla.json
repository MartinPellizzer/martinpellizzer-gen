    "intro": "Ravensara macrophylla, commonly known as the broad-leaved raven's arum, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in length, giving it a dramatic visual presence. The plant produces striking purple and white flowers arranged in a spadix, typical of the Araceae family. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist, shaded environments. Ravensara macrophylla is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine in some regions."
