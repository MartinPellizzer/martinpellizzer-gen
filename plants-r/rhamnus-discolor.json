    "intro": "Rhamnus discolor, commonly known as the variegated buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves with a distinctive variegated pattern of green and white. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by black, egg-shaped berries in the fall. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and streambanks. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain regions."
