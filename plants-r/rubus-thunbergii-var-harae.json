    "intro": "Rubus thunbergii var. harae, commonly known as the Harae blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to East Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, dark purple to black berries. The plant typically grows in forested areas and thrives in moist, well-drained soil. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it produces white flowers in the spring. The berries are edible and often used in culinary applications, though they are generally smaller and less sweet than other blackberry varieties."
