    "intro": "Ruschia amicorum, commonly known as the friendship plant, is a succulent native to South Africa. It features fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or orange during the warmer months. Its leaves are typically blue-green, with a waxy coating that reduces water loss. Ruschia amicorum is well-suited for rock gardens and containers, requiring minimal care and full sun exposure."
