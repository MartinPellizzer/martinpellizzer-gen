    "intro": "Ranunculus procurrens, commonly known as the creeping buttercup, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a mat-forming growth habit with numerous slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three deeply lobed leaflets, and it thrives in moist, shady environments. Ranunculus procurrens is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks."
