    "intro": "Ranunculus kunlunshanicus, commonly known as the Kunlun mountain buttercup, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family, characterized by its showy, often brightly colored flowers. The plant typically features simple, palmately lobed leaves and produces flowers with five to eight sepals and petals. It thrives in cold, moist environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its mountainous habitat. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species."
