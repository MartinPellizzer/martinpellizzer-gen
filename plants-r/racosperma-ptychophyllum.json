It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod fruits. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is well adapted to arid environments. Its small, yellow flowers are clustered in dense spikes, and it is often used in revegetation projects due to its hardiness. The species is also valued for its role in nitrogen fixation, benefiting surrounding vegetation."
