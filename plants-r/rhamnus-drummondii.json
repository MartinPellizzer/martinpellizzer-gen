    "intro": "Rhamnus drummondii, commonly known as Drummond's buckthorn, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its small, dark green leaves and produces clusters of yellowish-green flowers in the spring. The plant is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky soils and chaparral habitats. Its fruit is a small, smooth, black berry that ripens in late summer. Drummond's buckthorn plays a role in supporting local wildlife, particularly birds, which feed on its berries."
