It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and smaller, fragrant flowers compared to the typical form. The plant is deciduous, producing red hips in the autumn that are rich in vitamin C. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in hedgerows and woodland edges. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in herbal medicine."
