    "intro": "Rubus subincertus, commonly known as the uncertain bramble, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is native to eastern North America, where it typically grows in moist, wooded areas. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible, red berries in the summer. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the stems are thorny, typical of many Rubus species. This plant plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing food for various wildlife species."
