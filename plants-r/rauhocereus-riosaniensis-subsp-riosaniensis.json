    "intro": "Rauhocereus riosaniensis subsp. riosaniensis, commonly known as the R\u00edo Sanani cactus, is a rare and striking species native to a small region in northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that can grow up to several meters in height, often with a bluish-gray coloration. The plant produces large, white to pale yellow flowers during the summer months, which are highly fragrant and attract various pollinators. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires full sun exposure. Due to its limited natural habitat and vulnerability to environmental changes, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
