    "intro": "Rosa \u00d7 dumetorum f. subrecedens, commonly known as the creeping Rosa, is a hybrid species belonging to the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit, with stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink to white, typically appearing in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are compound, consisting of five to seven elliptical leaflets, and are covered in fine, soft hairs. This variety is often found in moist, shaded environments and is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness."
