    "intro": "Rhododendron kiyosumense subsp. mayebaraeohsumiense, commonly known as the Kiyosumi rhododendron, is a rare and endemic species native to Japan. It is characterized by its broad, leathery leaves that are typically dark green with a slight pubescence. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped flowers, usually in shades of pink to red, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and requires partial to full shade for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
