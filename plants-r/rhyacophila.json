    "intro": "Rhyacophila, commonly known as the stonefly, is a genus of aquatic insects belonging to the family Rhyacophilidae. These insects are typically found in clean, fast-flowing streams and rivers, where they play a vital role in aquatic ecosystems. Their larvae are herbivorous, feeding on algae and detritus, while adults are short-lived and primarily feed on nectar. Rhyacophila species are important indicators of water quality due to their sensitivity to pollution. Their presence or absence can provide valuable information about the health of freshwater habitats."
