    "intro": "Rosa alixensis, commonly known as the Alaska rose, is a flowering plant native to the northwestern United States and southern Canada. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along streams and in forested areas. The plant features simple, alternate leaves with serrated edges and produces fragrant, pink to white flowers in the summer. Rosa alixensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its beauty and fragrance. It plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for small wildlife."
