    "intro": "Rosa rugosa var. subinermis, commonly known as the smooth rose or rugosa rose, is a deciduous shrub native to coastal regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its thornless stems and dense, sprawling growth habit, making it well-suited for hedges or as a decorative plant. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, typically in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are oval-shaped, serrated, and have a leathery texture, while its fruit is a bright red, hairy rose hip. This variety is valued for its hardiness, adaptability, and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
