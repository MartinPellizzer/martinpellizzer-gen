It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces edible berries that ripen to a dark purple or black color in the summer. Its leaves are typically trifoliate, with three leaflets that are serrated along the edges. Rubus dicrophilus thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
