    "intro": "Rhus canadensis, commonly known as staghorn sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and turn vibrant red in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into clusters of red, fleshy berries. Its bark is rough and furrowed, with a distinctive, rugged appearance. Rhus canadensis thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in woodland edges, thickets, and disturbed soils."
