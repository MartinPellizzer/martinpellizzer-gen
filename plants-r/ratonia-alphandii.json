    "intro": "Ratonia alphandii, commonly known as the Alphand's ratonia, is a small evergreen shrub native to the western Mediterranean region. It typically grows to a height of about 30 centimeters, featuring dense, compact foliage composed of small, leathery leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, fragrant white flowers in the spring, which are followed by small, round berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or limestone areas. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
