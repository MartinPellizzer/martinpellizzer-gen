    "intro": "Rotala protracta, commonly known as the narrowleaf waterwheel plant, is a species of aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that float on the water surface. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense spikes, often emerging from the water. Rotala protracta thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments and is often used in aquascaping due to its aesthetic appeal. Its rapid growth rate makes it both a desirable and potentially invasive species in certain aquatic ecosystems."
