It typically produces pink to white blooms that appear in late spring to early summer. The plant has serrated, dark green leaves and is often found in woodland or moist, shaded areas. It is a deciduous species, shedding its foliage in the fall. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to form dense ground cover."
