    "intro": "Rokautskyia latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved rokautsky, is a rare and unique species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers during the summer months, which are followed by distinctive, elongated seed pods. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and requires a cool, temperate climate. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
