It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and compact growth habit. The leaves are typically dark green and have a finely dissected appearance, giving the plant a unique ornamental look. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
