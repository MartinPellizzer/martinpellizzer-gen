It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring woody stems and dense foliage. The plant produces large, showy flowers that are usually white or pale pink, which bloom at night and emit a fragrant scent to attract nocturnal pollinators. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and covered in fine hairs, while its fruit is a woody capsule that contains several seeds. Rosa breweri is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique blooming habit."
