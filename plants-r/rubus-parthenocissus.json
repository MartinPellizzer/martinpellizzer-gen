It is characterized by its compound leaves that turn bright red in the fall, adding vibrant color to the landscape. The plant produces small, white, five-petaled flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits. It has a vigorous growth habit and can be found along woodland edges and in disturbed areas. Its botanical features make it both an ornamental and ecologically important species."
