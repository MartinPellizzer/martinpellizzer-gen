    "intro": "Rumex \u00d7 adscendens, commonly known as the hybrid sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant that belongs to the Polygonaceae family. It is a natural hybrid between Rumex acetosa (common sorrel) and Rumex acetobursa (broad-leaved sorrel), resulting in a plant with distinctive morphological features. The leaves are typically broad and heart-shaped, with a serrated margin and a red or purple coloration on the veins. It thrives in moist, temperate environments and is often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. This plant is valued for its edible leaves, though they should be consumed in moderation due to their oxalic acid content."
