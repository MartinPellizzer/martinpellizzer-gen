    "intro": "Rosa alpina globosa, commonly known as the Alpine globular rose, is a species of flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its compact, rounded growth habit and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets, and its stems are covered in soft, grayish hairs. Rosa alpina globosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
