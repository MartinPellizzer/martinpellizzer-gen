    "intro": "Rubus gratus var. microphyllus, commonly known as the small-leaved evergreen blackberry, is a variant of the evergreen blackberry species native to the coastal regions of southern California. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, leathery leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in length. The plant produces dark purple to black berries that are typically smaller than those of the standard Rubus gratus. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for coastal gardens. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often cultivated for both its aesthetic appeal and edible fruits."
