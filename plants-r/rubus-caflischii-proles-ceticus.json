    "intro": "Rubus caflischii proles ceticus, commonly known as the Ceticus blackberry, is a species of brambles native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its thorny stems and aggregate fruits that develop from multiple small drupelets. The plant typically grows in shrubland habitats, often in areas with well-drained soils. Its leaves are palmately compound, with serrated margins and a hairy underside. The flowers are white or pale pink, and the plant is valued for its edible berries, though they are not as widely cultivated as other blackberry species."
