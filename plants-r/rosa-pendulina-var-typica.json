    "intro": "Rosa pendulina var. typica, commonly known as the hanging rose, is a climbing shrub native to the Canary Islands. It features slender, twining stems that can grow up to several meters in length, allowing it to climb and trail over supports. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, typically blooming in spring. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with finely toothed leaflets that provide a delicate, lace-like appearance. Rosa pendulina var. typica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its elegant, cascading form."
