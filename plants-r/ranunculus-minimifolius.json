It is characterized by its delicate, palmate leaves and showy, yellow-centered flowers with numerous petals. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its flowers bloom in the spring, adding a vibrant touch to its natural habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
