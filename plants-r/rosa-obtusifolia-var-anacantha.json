    "intro": "Rosa obtusifolia var. anacantha, commonly known as the woolly rose or the prickly rose, is a variant of the shrub rose native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and thorny stems, which provide structural support and protection. The plant produces fragrant, pink to red flowers during the summer months, adding ornamental value to gardens. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with a soft, fuzzy texture, and it thrives in well-drained soil and full sun. This variety is valued for its hardiness and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
