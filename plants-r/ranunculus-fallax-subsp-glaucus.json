    "intro": "Ranunculus fallax subsp. glaucus, commonly known as the glaucous buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves that are typically glaucous, giving the plant its common name. The plant produces showy yellow flowers with five to eight sepals that are often not petal-like. It thrives in moist, rocky or alpine habitats and is adapted to cold climates. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in some regions."
