    "intro": "Ranunculus sychnoschistus, commonly known as the alpine buttercup, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a basal rosette of heart-shaped, hairy leaves that are often covered in fine white hairs. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
