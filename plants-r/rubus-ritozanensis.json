    "intro": "Rubus ritozanensis, commonly known as the Ritozan blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its range."
