    "intro": "Ruppia, commonly known as sea rocket, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family RuppIaceae. These plants are typically found in brackish or saltwater environments, such as coastal wetlands and estuaries. Ruppia species are characterized by their small, bright yellow flowers and their ability to thrive in submerged or floating conditions. The leaves are usually narrow and ribbon-like, adapted to reduce water resistance. They play an important role in stabilizing sediments and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
