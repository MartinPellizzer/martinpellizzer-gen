    "intro": "Rheum rhomboideum, commonly known as the rhubarb plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its large, rhomboid-shaped leaves that are typically green with red or pink veins. The plant produces tall, upright stems that bear clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. Rheum rhomboideum is closely related to the edible rhubarb species and shares similar botanical features. Its leaves and stems contain high levels of oxalic acid, which makes them toxic if consumed raw."
