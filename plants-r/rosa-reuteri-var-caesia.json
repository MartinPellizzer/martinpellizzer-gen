    "intro": "Rosa reuteri var. caesia, commonly known as the blue rose, is a rare and unique variant of the Rosa reuteri species. It is distinguished by its striking blue-pink flowers, which are a result of a genetic mutation affecting pigmentation. The plant is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, where it thrives in cool, temperate climates. Its foliage consists of dark green, serrated leaves, and it produces fragrant blooms in late spring to early summer. Due to its rarity and aesthetic appeal, it is highly valued in horticulture and botanical gardens."
