    "intro": "Rheum austroiranicum, commonly known as the Armenian rhubarb, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and Central Asia. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in length, and its stout, reddish stems that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are followed by small, triangular seed pods. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forested areas or along stream banks. Due to its medicinal properties, it has been historically used to treat digestive ailments and as a mild laxative."
