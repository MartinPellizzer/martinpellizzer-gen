    "intro": "Ranunculus pinnatus, commonly known as the fernleaf buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features delicate, palmately compound leaves that resemble ferns, giving it its common name. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with five to seven petals, often adorned with a central cluster of stamens. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks. Ranunculus pinnatus is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional herbal medicine."
