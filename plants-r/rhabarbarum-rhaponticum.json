    "intro": "Rhabarbarum rhaponticum, commonly known as rhubarb, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North America. It features thick, fleshy stalks that are typically edible, though the leaves contain toxic levels of oxalic acid and should not be consumed. The plant produces large, showy flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, which bloom in early summer. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable conditions. Rhabarbarum rhaponticum is often cultivated for its tart stalks, which are used in cooking and baking."
