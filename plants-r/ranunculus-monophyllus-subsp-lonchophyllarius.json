    "intro": "Ranunculus monophyllus subsp. lonchophyllarius, commonly known as the broad-leaf buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features showy, yellow flowers with five broadly ovate petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has a basal rosette of large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain environments."
