    "intro": "Rosa beggeriana var. genuina, commonly known as the Tibetan rose, is a perennial shrub native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and clusters of fragrant, pink to white flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has small, ovate leaves with serrated edges, and its flowers are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its mountainous habitat. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal uses, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and conservation efforts."
