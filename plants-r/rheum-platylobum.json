    "intro": "Rheum platylobum, commonly known as the broadleaf rhubarb, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in length, which are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces tall, unbranched stems that bear clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in the spring. Its rhubarb-like stalks are edible, though they are usually cooked before consumption. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value as well as for its medicinal properties."
