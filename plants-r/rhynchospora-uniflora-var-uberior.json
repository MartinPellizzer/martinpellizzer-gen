    "intro": "Rhynchospora uniflora var. uberior, commonly known as the broadleaf marsh sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers. Its reproductive structures are adapted for wind pollination, which is common among sedges. This variety is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
