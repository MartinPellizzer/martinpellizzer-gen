    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 graniticarum, commonly known as the granite raspberry, is a hybrid species within the rose family (Rosaceae). It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, aggregate fruits that resemble raspberries. The plant typically grows in rocky, acidic soils, often found in mountainous or coastal regions. Its leaves are palmately compound, with serrated margins, and it produces showy white or pink flowers in the spring. Due to its hybrid origin, it exhibits a range of morphological variations, making it a subject of interest in botanical studies."
