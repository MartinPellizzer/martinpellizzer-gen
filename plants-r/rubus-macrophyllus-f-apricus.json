    "intro": "Rubus macrophyllus f. apricus, commonly known as the large-leaf raspberry, is a cultivated form of the raspberry plant characterized by its large, broad leaves. It is a deciduous shrub that produces edible, red berries, similar to other Rubus species. The plant thrives in temperate climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, and they appear in clusters before the berries develop. This variety is often grown for its fruit yield and ornamental value in gardens."
