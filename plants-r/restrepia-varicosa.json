It is a terrestrial orchid with a pseudobulbous structure, which helps it store water and nutrients. The plant produces a single, elongated leaf and has a tall, branched inflorescence that bears numerous fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. It thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
