    "intro": "Rhamnus subapetala, commonly known as the narrow-leaved buckthorn, is a species of shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by black, berry-like fruits in the autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or dry habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in landscaping or as a hedging plant."
