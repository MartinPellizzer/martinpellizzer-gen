    "intro": "Rubus thyrsoideus subsp. candicans, commonly known as the showy blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its erect, woody stems and large, trifoliate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of white to pale pink flowers in early spring, followed by edible, dark purple berries in late summer. Its fruit is prized for its sweet, aromatic flavor and is often used in jams and desserts. The subspecies is distinguished by its more showy flowers and slightly larger berries compared to other Rubus species."
