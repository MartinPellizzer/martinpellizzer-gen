    "intro": "Ranunculus commutatus, commonly known as the broadleaf buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features a basal rosette of heart-shaped, glossy green leaves with a distinctive white underside. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with five to eight petals, often surrounded by a ring of sepals. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and stream banks. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens but can become invasive in some regions."
