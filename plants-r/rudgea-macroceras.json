    "intro": "Rudgea macroceras, commonly known as the large-fruited rudgea, is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its woody stems and showy, clustered inflorescences. The plant produces small, white to pink flowers that are often accompanied by bright red bracts, making it visually striking. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments within the understory of rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
