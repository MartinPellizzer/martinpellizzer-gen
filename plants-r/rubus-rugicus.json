    "intro": "Rubus rugicus, commonly known as the rough raspberry, is a species of brambles native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or orange in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and hedgerows. Rubus rugicus is often found growing in clusters, forming dense thickets that can dominate the undergrowth."
