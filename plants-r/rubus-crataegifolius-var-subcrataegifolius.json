It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces dark purple to black berries that are typically harvested in the fall. Its leaves are narrow and have a serrated edge, distinguishing it from other Rubus species. It thrives in moist, wooded areas and is often found in the understory of forests."
