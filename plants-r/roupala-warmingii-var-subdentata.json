    "intro": "Roupala warmingii var. subdentata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved roupala, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are finely serrated along the margins, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by spherical, red berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
