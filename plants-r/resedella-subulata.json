    "intro": "Resedella subulata, commonly known as the needleleaf resedella, is a small flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves and delicate pink or white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it is often found in alpine meadows and slopes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species."
