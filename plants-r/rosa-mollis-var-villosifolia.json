    "intro": "Rosa mollis var. villosifolia, commonly known as the soft rose or velvet rose, is a shrub-like plant native to parts of Asia, particularly China. It is characterized by its soft, fuzzy leaves and clusters of fragrant, pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters and thrives in well-drained soil with partial to full sun exposure. Its ornamental value comes from its delicate foliage and showy blooms, making it a popular choice for gardens and floral arrangements. The variety is noted for its unique velvety texture, which distinguishes it from other rose species."
