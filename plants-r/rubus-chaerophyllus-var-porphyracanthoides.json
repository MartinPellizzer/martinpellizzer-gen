    "intro": "Rubus chaerophyllus var. porphyracanthoides, commonly known as the red-flowered blackberry. This variant is characterized by its distinctive deep red bracts that surround the flower cluster, adding a striking visual contrast to its typical blackberry foliage. The plant is a deciduous shrub with thorny stems and compound leaves, typical of the Rubus genus. It produces small, aggregate fruits that are similar to other blackberries but often have a more intense flavor. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils."
