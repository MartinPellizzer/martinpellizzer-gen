    "intro": "Ranunculus fallax f. indivisus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved buttercup, is a variant of the ranunculus genus characterized by its distinctive foliage and floral structure. This plant is native to regions of Europe and is often found in moist, shady habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are typically divided into fewer segments compared to the typical species, giving it a more compact appearance. The flowers are usually yellow with five petals and are accompanied by five sepals that are often shorter than the petals. It is a herbaceous perennial that blooms in early spring and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
