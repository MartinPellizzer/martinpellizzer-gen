    "intro": "Rhus lentii, commonly known as the Florida holly, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It features simple, alternate, ovate to elliptic leaves that are typically glossy and dark green on top with a lighter underside. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in the spring, followed by orange to red berries that are an important food source for wildlife. Rhus lentii thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in swamps, wetlands, and along stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it an important component of the wetland ecosystems it inhabits."
