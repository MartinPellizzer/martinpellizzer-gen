    "intro": "Rubus tomentosus var. brachyphyllus, commonly known as the short-leaved bramble, is a shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and small, oval leaves with a fuzzy, grayish underside. The plant produces white to pale pink flowers in the spring, followed by red, edible berries in the summer. It thrives in moist, woodland habitats and is often found in partial shade. Its botanical features make it a common species in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
