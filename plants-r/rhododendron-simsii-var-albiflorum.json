    "intro": "Rhododendron simsii var. albiflorum, commonly known as the White-flowered Rhododendron, is a compact evergreen shrub native to China. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and showy, white flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing clusters of five-petaled flowers that are highly fragrant. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soil and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to form dense thickets, providing both aesthetic appeal and habitat for small wildlife."
