    "intro": "Rubus dumetorum genuinus, commonly known as the European blackberry shrub, is a species of bramble native to Europe and parts of Western Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems, trifoliate leaves, and small, aggregate fruits that ripen to a dark purple or black color. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and open woodlands, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its flowers are white or pale pink, and it produces edible berries that are used in culinary and medicinal applications. The species is closely related to other Rubus species, including those that produce raspberries and blackberries."
