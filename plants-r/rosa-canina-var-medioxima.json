    "intro": "Rosa canina var. medioxima, commonly known as the Turkish rose or the dog rose, is a variant of the common dog rose, native to the Balkans and parts of Turkey. It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces fragrant pink or white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright orange-red hips in the autumn. These hips are rich in vitamin C and are often used in traditional medicine and culinary applications. Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and horticultural contexts."
