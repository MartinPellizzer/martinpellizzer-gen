    "intro": "Rhynchospora parva var. boninensis, commonly known as the Bonin marsh sedge, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the Bonin Islands. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like flower clusters. The plant typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, thriving in moist, nutrient-poor soils. It produces tiny, three-lobed flowers that are usually white or pale green, and it is often found in coastal or brackish habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
