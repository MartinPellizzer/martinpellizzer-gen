    "intro": "Rumex paluster, commonly known as water sorrel, is a perennial herb native to wetlands and marshy areas. It features alternate, heart-shaped leaves that are often reddish or purplish in color. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on slender stalks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and colonize moist soils effectively. Rumex paluster is often found in shallow water or along the edges of ponds and streams."
