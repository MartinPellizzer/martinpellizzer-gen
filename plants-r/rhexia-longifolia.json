    "intro": "Rhexia longifolia, commonly known as the longleaf rhexia, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands, swamps, and along stream banks. The plant features showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are elongated and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in wet environments. Rhexia longifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
