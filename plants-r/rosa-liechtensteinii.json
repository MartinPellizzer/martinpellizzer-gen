    "intro": "Rosa liechtensteinii, commonly known as the Liechtenstein rose, is a rare and delicate species native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant has narrow, dark green leaves with a slightly hairy texture, and its stems are covered in thorns. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forested areas or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
