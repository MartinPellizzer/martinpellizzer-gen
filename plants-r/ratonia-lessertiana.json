    "intro": "Ratonia lessertiana, commonly known as the Lesser's ratonia, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its striking, velvety purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has palmate leaves with a waxy surface, adapted to the cool, moist conditions of its natural habitat. It is typically found in cloud forests and is known for its slow growth and long lifespan. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
