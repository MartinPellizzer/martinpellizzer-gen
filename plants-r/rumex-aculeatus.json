    "intro": "Rumex aculeatus, commonly known as sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive arrow-shaped leaves, which are covered in fine, stinging hairs that can cause a mild irritation upon contact. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in moist, fertile soils and is often found in woodland edges, meadows, and along stream banks. Rumex aculeatus is valued both for its culinary uses and as a plant with potential medicinal properties."
