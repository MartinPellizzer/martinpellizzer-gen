    "intro": "Rhinolobium, commonly known as the fairy lantern, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Scrophulariaceae. These plants are characterized by their unique, lantern-like flowers that are often brightly colored, typically in shades of red, orange, or yellow. Rhinolobium species are native to southern and eastern Africa, where they thrive in moist, woodland environments. The flowers are bilaterally symmetrical and feature a distinctive, inflated lower lip that resembles a lantern. They are often cultivated for their ornamental value and are also used in traditional medicine in some regions."
