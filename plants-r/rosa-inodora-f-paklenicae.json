    "intro": "Rosa inodora f. paklenicae, commonly known as the Paklenica rose, is a rare and unique botanical variant native to the Paklenica National Park in Croatia. This sub-species is characterized by its compact growth habit and deep pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring. It possesses a dense, thorny stem structure typical of many rose species, and its leaves are dark green with a slightly serrated edge. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
