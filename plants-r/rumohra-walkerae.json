    "intro": "Rumohra walkerae, commonly known as the New Zealand sword fern, is a species of fern native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its sword-shaped, evergreen fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are bioluminescent at night, a unique feature that aids in attracting pollinators."
