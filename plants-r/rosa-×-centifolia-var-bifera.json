    "intro": "Rosa \u00d7 centifolia var. bifera, commonly known as the Damask rose, is a hybrid rose species originating from the cross between Rosa damascena and Rosa gallica. It is characterized by its fragrant, semi-double to fully double pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is a shrub with thorny stems and dark green, lobed leaves, typically growing to a height of 1 to 2 meters. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and essential oil production. The variety 'bifera' is notable for its unique, branched inflorescence, which distinguishes it from other Rosa \u00d7 centifolia varieties."
