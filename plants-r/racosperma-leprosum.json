    "intro": "Racosperma leprosum, commonly known as the hairy wattle, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to eastern Australia and is characterized by its compound leaves with small, hairy stipules. The plant produces yellow flowers in clustered inflorescences, which are typical of the wattles. Racosperma leprosum is often found in dry, open habitats such as woodlands and grasslands. It plays a role in soil stabilization and provides nectar for native pollinators."
