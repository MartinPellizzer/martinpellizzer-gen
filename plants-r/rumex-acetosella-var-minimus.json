    "intro": "Rumex acetosella var. minimus, commonly known as lesser sorrel, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves with a reddish or purple underside, which are typically less than 1 inch in length. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters during the spring and early summer. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. This variant is closely related to the common sorrel (Rumex acetosella) but is distinguished by its smaller size and distinct leaf morphology."
