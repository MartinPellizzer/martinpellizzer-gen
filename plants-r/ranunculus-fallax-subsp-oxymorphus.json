It features delicate, palmately lobed leaves and showy, yellow flowers with five petals. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in woodland or meadow habitats. It blooms from late spring to early summer, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
