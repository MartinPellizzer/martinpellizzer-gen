    "intro": "Rubus humifusus, commonly known as the creeping raspberry, is a species of bramble native to the eastern United States. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its low-growing, sprawling stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in the spring, which are followed by edible, red berries in the summer. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three leaflets that are serrated and covered in fine hairs. Rubus humifusus is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks."
