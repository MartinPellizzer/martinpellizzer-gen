    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus subsp. bathyodon, commonly known as the deep-rooted buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its palmate leaves and showy yellow flowers with a distinctive black center. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in meadows and woodland edges. It has a deep taproot system, which allows it to thrive in well-drained environments. The subspecies is distinguished by its more robust growth and longer, narrower leaves compared to the typical form of Ranunculus auricomus."
