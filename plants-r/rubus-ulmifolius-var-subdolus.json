    "intro": "Rubus ulmifolius var. subdolus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved blackberry, is a variant of the common blackberry species. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are narrower than those of the typical Rubus ulmifolius. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically less showy than those of other blackberry varieties. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils. This variant is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes cultivated for its edible fruits."
