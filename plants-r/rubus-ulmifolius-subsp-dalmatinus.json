    "intro": "Rubus ulmifolius subsp. dalmatinus, commonly known as Dalmatian blackberry, is a shrub native to the Balkan Peninsula and parts of southern Europe. It is characterized by its dark green, doubly serrated leaves and produces small, aggregate fruits that range from black to dark purple in color. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its edible berries. The subspecies is closely related to other Rubus species but is distinguished by its unique leaf shape and habitat preferences."
