    "intro": "Rubus pirifolius var. pirifolius, commonly known as the Japanese blackberry, is a species of bramble native to East Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems, trifoliate leaves, and aggregate fruits composed of small, dark red to black drupelets. The plant produces edible berries that are often used in jams and desserts. It thrives in temperate climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Due to its invasive potential, it is often managed carefully in non-native regions."
