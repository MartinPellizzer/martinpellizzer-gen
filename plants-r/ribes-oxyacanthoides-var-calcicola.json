    "intro": "Ribes oxyacanthoides var. calcicola, commonly known as the calcicola gooseberry, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its small, thorned stems and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces edible berries that are typically yellow or orange in color, though they are less commonly consumed than other gooseberry varieties. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, dry environments. This variety is often found in rocky habitats and is valued for its ornamental and ecological significance."
