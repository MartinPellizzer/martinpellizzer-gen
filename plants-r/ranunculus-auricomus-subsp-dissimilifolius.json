    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus subsp. dissimilifolius, commonly known as the yellow buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features showy, bright yellow flowers with five petal-like sepals, often mistaken for true petals. The plant has a basal rosette of leaves that are typically lobed or divided, with a distinctive hairy texture. Its leaves and stems are covered in fine, soft hairs, which help reduce water loss in drier conditions. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks."
