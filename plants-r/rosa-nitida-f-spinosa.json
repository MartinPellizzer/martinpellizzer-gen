    "intro": "Rosa nitida f. spinosa, commonly known as the spiny evergreen rose, is a compact, shrub-like plant native to China. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and small, dark green leaves that remain on the plant throughout the year. The plant produces fragrant, pink or white flowers in late spring to early summer. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its hardiness and decorative appearance. Due to its thorny nature, it is well-suited for use as a hedge or boundary plant."
