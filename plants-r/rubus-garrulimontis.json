    "intro": "Rubus garrulimontis, commonly known as the mountain blackberry, is a species of brambles native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves, typical of the Rubus genus. The plant produces small, dark red to black berries that are edible and often used in local cuisines. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its rugged habitat, it is relatively rare and considered a valuable component of alpine ecosystems."
