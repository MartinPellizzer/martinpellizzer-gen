    "intro": "Rubus semierectus, commonly known as the upright blackberry shrub, is a species of bramble native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with three to five leaflets. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that ripen to a dark purple or black color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and thickets. Due to its hardy nature, it is a common weed in disturbed areas."
