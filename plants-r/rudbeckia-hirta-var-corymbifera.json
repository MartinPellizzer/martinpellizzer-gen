    "intro": "Rudbeckia hirta var. corymbifera, commonly known as the pale coneflower, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and its showy, yellow-orange ray flowers surrounding a central disk of dark brown or black florets. The plant typically grows between 1 to 3 feet tall and produces numerous small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer to early fall. Its leaves are lance-shaped, hairy, and arranged alternately along the stem. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
