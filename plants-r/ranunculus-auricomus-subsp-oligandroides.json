    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus subsp. oligandroides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features bright yellow flowers with five to seven petals, typically appearing in early spring. The plant has finely divided, pinnately compound leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and stream banks. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in some regions."
