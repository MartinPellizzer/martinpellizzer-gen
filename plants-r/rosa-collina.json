    "intro": "Rosa collina, commonly known as the creeping or sand rose, is a low-growing shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, often prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across sandy or rocky soils. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white, typically blooming in spring. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and covered in fine, downy hairs. Rosa collina is well adapted to coastal and arid environments, making it a hardy, drought-tolerant species."
