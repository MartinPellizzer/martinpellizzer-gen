    "intro": "Ranunculus bulbosus subsp. dissectus, commonly known as the dissected buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features delicate, palmately divided leaves and bright yellow flowers with five petals. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its flowers bloom in early spring, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that contain several seeds. The subspecies is distinguished by its finely dissected foliage, which gives it a more refined appearance compared to other ranunculus species."
