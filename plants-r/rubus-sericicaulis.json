    "intro": "Rubus sericicaulis, commonly known as the silky raspberry, is a species of bramble native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its slender, arching stems and small, trifoliate leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or black in color, similar to other raspberries. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. Due to its delicate appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
