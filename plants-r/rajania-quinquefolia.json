    "intro": "Rajania quinquefolia, commonly known as the five-leaved saxifrage, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central and Southern Europe. It is characterized by its basal rosette of five to seven elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in late spring, which are clustered in a compact inflorescence. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Rajania quinquefolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
