It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its prickly stems and small, usually white or pink flowers. The plant produces aggregate fruits, known as drupes, which are typically red or black when mature. It thrives in woodland edges, hedgerows, and disturbed soils, often forming dense thickets. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas."
