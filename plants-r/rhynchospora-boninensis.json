    "intro": "Rhynchospora boninensis, commonly known as the Bonin marsh sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Bonin Islands in the Pacific Ocean. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow leaves. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its flowering spikes consist of small, clustered flowers that are often inconspicuous, and it plays a role in the ecological balance of its native environment. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
