These plants are native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya and Tanzania. Rufodorsia species are characterized by their striking, often brightly colored flowers and a distinctive, aromatic scent that is more pronounced in certain species. They typically grow in humid, shaded environments, often as epiphytes on trees or rocks. The genus is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in local ecosystems and traditional medicine."
