    "intro": "Rosa simkovicsii var. brachycarpa, commonly known as the short-fruited rock rose, is a shrub native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces compact, round fruits that are typically red or pink in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, mountainous environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
