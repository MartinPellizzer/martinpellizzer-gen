    "intro": "Rhodorhiza floridus var. densiflora, commonly known as the Florida denseflower rhodorhiza, is a rare flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as swamps and marshes, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often forming a dense rosette near the ground. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
