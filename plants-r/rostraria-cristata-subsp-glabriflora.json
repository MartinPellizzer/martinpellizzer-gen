    "intro": "Rostraria cristata subsp. glabriflora, commonly known as the hairy-flowered rostraria, is a rare and specialized member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated inflorescence and finely divided, feathery leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in a raceme, often with a subtle fragrance. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is typically found in woodland or streamside habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
