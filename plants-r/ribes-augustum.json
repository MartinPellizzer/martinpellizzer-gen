    "intro": "Ribes augustum, commonly known as the purpleflower currant, is a deciduous shrub native to western North America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of showy, violet-pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, edible berries that ripen to a dark red or black color in late summer. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a serrated margin, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. Ribes augustum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional herbal medicine."
