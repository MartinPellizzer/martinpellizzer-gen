    "intro": "Ribes petraeum, commonly known as the rock gooseberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by edible, red, berry-like fruits. The plant typically grows on rocky slopes and in alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a serrated margin, while its stems are often covered in fine, glandular hairs. Ribes petraeum is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
