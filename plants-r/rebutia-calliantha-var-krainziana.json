    "intro": "Rebutia calliantha var. krainziana, commonly known as the Krainziana Rebutia, is a compact, low-growing cactus native to Mexico. It features a globular or cylindrical stem with a smooth, pale green surface covered in small, white to yellowish spines. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are borne on short pedicels. It is well-suited for rock gardens and containers due to its compact size and drought tolerance. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
