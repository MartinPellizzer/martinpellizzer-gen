    "intro": "Ranunculus schottii, commonly known as the Schott's buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America. It features a short, stout rhizome and produces basal leaves that are palmately divided with hairy surfaces. The plant bears showy, yellow flowers with five petals, often surrounded by a ring of sepals. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of mountainous regions. Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
