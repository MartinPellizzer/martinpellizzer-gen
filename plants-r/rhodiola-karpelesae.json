    "intro": "Rhodiola karpelesae, commonly known as the Karpeles' rhodiola, is a rare alpine plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Crassulaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, succulent leaves and small, pinkish flowers. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, often in areas with low temperatures and intense sunlight. Rhodiola karpelesae is known for its ability to tolerate extreme environmental conditions, making it a unique example of adaptive plant life. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
