    "intro": "Rubus schummelii f. hypomalacus, commonly known as the Schumacher's raspberry, is a rare and distinctive variant of the raspberry plant. It is characterized by its small, pale pink to white flowers and its unique, flattened, almost leaf-like bracts. The plant is native to specific regions in South America, particularly in Argentina and Chile, where it grows in temperate climates. Its botanical features include a thorny stem, trifoliate leaves, and small, aggregate fruits that develop from the flower clusters. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
