    "intro": "Rosa canina var. squarrosula, commonly known as the squarrosula rose, is a variant of the dog rose, characterized by its distinctive, slightly hairy, and often wrinkled leaves. It is a shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia, typically growing in woodland edges and hedgerows. The plant produces fragrant, pink or red flowers in late spring, which give way to orange-red hips in autumn. Its leaves are usually oval with serrated edges, and the stems are covered in thorns. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in herbal medicine."
