    "intro": "Ranunculus michiganensis, commonly known as Michigan crowncup, is a flowering plant native to the Great Lakes region of North America. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as wetlands and stream banks. The plant features basal leaves that are deeply lobed and showy yellow flowers with numerous stamens. It blooms from late spring to early summer, and its seeds are dispersed by water. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in some areas."
