    "intro": "Rebutia xanthocarpa var. dasyphrissa, commonly known as the yellow fruit rebutia, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of Central America. It features compact, rounded stems covered in dense, woolly hairs that help reduce water loss. The plant produces bright yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically tubular in shape. Its leaves are fleshy and often turn reddish in response to sunlight. The fruit is small, fleshy, and turns orange when mature, containing seeds that are dispersed by animals."
