    "intro": "Rosa canina f. subglabra, commonly known as the smooth hips rose, is a botanical variant of the dog rose. It is characterized by its smooth, hairless fruit capsules, which contrast with the typical hairy hips of the standard Rosa canina. The plant produces fragrant pink to white flowers in early summer, followed by the development of its distinctive fruits. It is a shrub that thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges and hedgerows. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used in traditional herbal medicine."
