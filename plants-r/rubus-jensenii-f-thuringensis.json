    "intro": "Rubus jensenii f. thuringensis, commonly known as the Thuringian raspberry, is a rare and lesser-known variant of the raspberry genus. It is characterized by its small, red, aggregate fruits that develop from multiple ovaria. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories. Its leaves are compound, with serrated edges and a slightly hairy texture. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a botanically significant but endangered species."
