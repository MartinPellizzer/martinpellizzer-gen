    "intro": "Rosa aginensis, commonly known as the Armenian rose, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and parts of Turkey. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of fragrant, pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has dark green, serrated leaves and produces small, red berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. Rosa aginensis is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used in traditional medicine for its potential healing properties. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth."
