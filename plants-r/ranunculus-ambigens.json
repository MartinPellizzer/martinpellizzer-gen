    "intro": "Ranunculus ambigens, commonly known as the ambiguous buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features basal leaves that are palmately lobed and covered in a dense layer of soft, white hairs. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with five to eight petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain environments."
