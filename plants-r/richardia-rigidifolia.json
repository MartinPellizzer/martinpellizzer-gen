    "intro": "Richardia rigidifolia, commonly known as the rigid flatleaf, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, hollow stems and finely divided leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. Its leaves are typically rigid and have a slightly rough texture, contributing to its common name. Richardia rigidifolia is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
