    "intro": "Rhus puberula, commonly known as the smooth sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and have a smooth, glossy surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by red, fuzzy berries that are a common food source for birds. Rhus puberula thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in woodland edges and dry, sandy soils. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a popular choice for erosion control and ornamental landscaping."
