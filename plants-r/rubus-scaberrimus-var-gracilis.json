    "intro": "Rubus scaberrimus var. gracilis, commonly known as the slender bramble, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its thorny stems and trifoliate leaves, which are typically covered in fine, stiff hairs. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in the spring, followed by red, hairy berries that are edible but often tart. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its botanical features make it an important species for pollinators and a component of diverse forest ecosystems."
