    "intro": "Rubus niveus var. falconeri, commonly known as the white-berried raspberry, is a variant of the raspberry plant native to certain regions of South America. It is characterized by its pale pink to white flowers and small, edible berries that are typically less tart than those of other raspberry varieties. The plant thrives in temperate climates and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands or streamside areas. Its foliage consists of trifoliate leaves with serrated edges, and it produces woody canes that grow from underground rhizomes. This species is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its use in local culinary traditions."
