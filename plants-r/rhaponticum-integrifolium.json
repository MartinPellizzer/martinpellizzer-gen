    "intro": "Rhaponticum integrifolium, commonly known as the Siberian rhubarb, is a perennial plant native to the cold climates of Siberia and Central Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its hardiness, it is often cultivated in gardens as an ornamental and for its edible parts."
