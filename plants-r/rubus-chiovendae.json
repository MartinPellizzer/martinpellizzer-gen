    "intro": "Rubus chiovendae, commonly known as the Chiovenda raspberry, is a species of bramble native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red when mature, similar to other raspberries. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous areas with well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
