    "intro": "Rubus viridifolius, commonly known as the green-leaved blackberry, is a species of bramble native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically green with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, dark purple berries that are edible but often tart in flavor. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland edges and thickets. Its botanical features make it an important component of native ecosystems and a subject of interest in horticultural studies."
