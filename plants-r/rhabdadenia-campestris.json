    "intro": "Rhabdadenia campestris, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, fleshy leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces clusters of small, five-petaled flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, blooming during the warmer months. Its growth habit and drought tolerance make it well-suited for xeriscaping and ecological restoration projects. Rhabdadenia campestris plays a role in supporting local pollinators and stabilizing sandy soils in its native habitat."
