    "intro": "Rubus pallidifolius, commonly known as the pale-leaved blackberry, is a species of bramble native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its trailing or climbing growth habit, with thorny stems and compound leaves that are pale green in color. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black when ripe. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and agricultural settings."
