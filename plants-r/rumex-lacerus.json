    "intro": "Rumex lacerus, commonly known as the narrowleaf dock, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features upright, reddish stems that are often hairy, and its leaves are elongated, with a serrated margin and a waxy, dark green upper surface. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in dense clusters during the spring and early summer. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in wet meadows. Rumex lacerus is valued for its historical use in herbal medicine and as a forage plant for livestock."
