    "intro": "Ribes occidentale, commonly known as the western gooseberry, is a deciduous shrub native to western North America. It belongs to the Grossulariaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces edible berries that are typically red or orange when ripe, though they are often tart and used in jams or wines. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas or along streambanks. Ribes occidentale is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance as a food source for birds and wildlife."
