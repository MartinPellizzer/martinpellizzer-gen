    "intro": "Racka torrida, commonly known as the fiery flame orchid, is a unique flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its striking red and orange petals that resemble flames, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in hot, dry climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its flowers bloom during the warmer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited habitat and specific environmental needs, Racka torrida is considered a rare and endangered species."
