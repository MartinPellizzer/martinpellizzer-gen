    "intro": "Rosa \u00d7 andegavensis f. subsystylis, commonly known as the subsystylis form of the Andegavensis rose, is a hybrid species within the genus Rosa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and profuse blooming of fragrant, semi-double pink flowers. The subsystylis form exhibits distinct floral morphology, with stamens that are shorter than the petals, a trait that sets it apart from other forms of Rosa \u00d7 andegavensis. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often grown in gardens for its aesthetic and aromatic qualities. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth and flowering."
