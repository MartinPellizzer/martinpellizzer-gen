It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, linear leaves that are often hairy along the edges. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are clustered along the stems. Rumohra chinensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticulture for its graceful appearance."
