It is characterized by its compact growth habit and vibrant, deep red flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has dark green, serrated leaves and produces fragrant, semi-double blooms. It is well-suited for rock gardens and alpine settings due to its cold hardiness. The variety is noted for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soil."
