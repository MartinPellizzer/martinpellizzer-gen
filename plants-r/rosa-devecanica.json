    "intro": "Rosa devecanica, commonly known as the Devecane rose, is a species native to the Balkans, particularly in parts of Serbia and Bosnia. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring thorny stems and compound leaves with five to seven leaflets. The plant produces fragrant, pink to red flowers in late spring to early summer, which are followed by oval, red-orange fruits called hips. Rosa devecanica is valued for its ornamental qualities and has also been used in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
