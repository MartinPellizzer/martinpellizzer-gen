    "intro": "Rhamnella wilsonii, commonly known as Wilson's rhamnus, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California and northern Baja California. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, round berries that are typically red when mature. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal scrub habitats. Rhamnella wilsonii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to withstand salty coastal conditions."
