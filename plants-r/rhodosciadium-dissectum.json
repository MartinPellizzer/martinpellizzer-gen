    "intro": "Rhodosciadium dissectum, commonly known as the dissected rhododendron, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant has fragrant, evergreen foliage that is finely dissected, giving it a delicate, lace-like appearance. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in horticulture, though it remains relatively rare in the wild."
