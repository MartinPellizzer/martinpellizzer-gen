    "intro": "Ruehssia dussii, commonly known as the Sierra Madre dussii, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or well-drained soils, thriving in high-altitude environments. Its small, yellow flowers are often clustered in dense inflorescences, and it is known for its aromatic foliage. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
