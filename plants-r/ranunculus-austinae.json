    "intro": "Ranunculus austinae, commonly known as the Austina's buttercup, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Chile. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family, characterized by its showy, often brightly colored flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky soils, thriving in cooler, moist environments. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, with 5 to 15 sepals and petals that are often mistaken for true petals. The species is relatively rare and is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological adaptations and limited distribution."
