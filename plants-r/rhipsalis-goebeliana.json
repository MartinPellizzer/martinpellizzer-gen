    "intro": "Rhipsalis goebeliana, commonly known as the Goebel's mistletoe cactus, is a unique epiphytic plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its long, thin, branching stems that resemble twining vines. Unlike typical cacti, it lacks spines and instead has small, clustered flowers that are often white or pale pink. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees in the understory of rainforests. Its ability to absorb moisture from the air makes it well adapted to its natural habitat."
