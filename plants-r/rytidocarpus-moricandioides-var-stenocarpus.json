    "intro": "Rytidocarpus moricandioides var. stenocarpus, commonly known as the narrow-fruit cycad, is a unique cycad species native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of feather-like leaves that are typically dark green. The plant produces small, spherical, yellowish cones that are enclosed in a fleshy, reddish covering. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and requires well-drained soil. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
