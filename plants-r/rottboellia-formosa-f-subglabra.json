    "intro": "Rottboellia formosa f. subglabra, commonly known as the smooth rottboellia, is a variant of the rottboellia plant characterized by its reduced hair coverage on the foliage. This grass species is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia and is often found in disturbed soils and open areas. The leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and the inflorescence consists of spikelets arranged in a loose panicle. It produces small, two-lobed seeds that are adapted for wind dispersal. The plant is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its visual appeal."
