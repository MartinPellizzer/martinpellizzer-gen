    "intro": "Rotala koreana, commonly known as Korean waterwheel, is a species of aquatic plant native to East Asia. It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in shallow freshwater habitats such as ponds and slow-moving streams. It produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Rotala koreana is often used in water gardens and pond landscaping due to its ornamental value and ability to help control algae growth."
