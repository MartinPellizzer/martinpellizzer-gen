    "intro": "Rubus nakeralicus, commonly known as the Nakerali blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Rubus genus, which includes many species of shrubs with thorny stems and aggregate fruits. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically harvested when fully ripe. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the plant thrives in cool, moist climates. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and lesser-known member of the Rubus family."
