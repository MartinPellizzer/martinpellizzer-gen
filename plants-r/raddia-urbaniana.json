    "intro": "Raddia urbaniana, commonly known as the Urbanian raddia, is a flowering plant native to specific regions in southern Africa. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub, reaching heights of up to 1 meter, with opposite, elliptical leaves that are often hairy. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, and it produces small, round berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Raddia urbaniana is considered a rare and less-studied species in botanical research."
