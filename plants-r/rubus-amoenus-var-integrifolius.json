    "intro": "Rubus amoenus var. integrifolius, commonly known as the smooth-leaf blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, serrated leaves and thornless stems, which distinguish it from other Rubus species. The plant produces small, dark purple berries that are typically harvested in late summer. Its botanical features include a complex root system and a shrub-like growth habit. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and thickets."
