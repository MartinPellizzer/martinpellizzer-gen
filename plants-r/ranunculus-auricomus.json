    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus, commonly known as the golden buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features showy, bright yellow flowers with five petal-like sepals and numerous stamens, which give it a distinctive, almost sun-like appearance. The plant typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm, with hairy stems and trifoliate leaves that are deeply lobed. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges. The flowers bloom from late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
