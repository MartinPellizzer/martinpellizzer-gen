It is characterized by its distinctive floral morphology, featuring smaller, more clustered flowers compared to the typical Rosa canina. The plant exhibits a shrub-like growth habit with thorny stems and pinnate leaves. Its flowers are usually pink to red in color, and it produces rosehips that are slightly different in size and shape. This subspecies is native to parts of Southeast Asia, where it thrives in temperate climates."
