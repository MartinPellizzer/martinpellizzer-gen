    "intro": "Ranunculus britannicus, commonly known as the British buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the United Kingdom. It features showy, yellow flowers with five petals and a distinctive central yellow bulbous structure. The plant typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm, with palmately lobed leaves that are hairy beneath. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in wet meadows and riverbanks. The species is protected in some areas due to habitat loss and is considered a key indicator of undisturbed wetland ecosystems."
