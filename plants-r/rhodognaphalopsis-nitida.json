It is native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes, where it thrives in cold, arid environments. The plant is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. Its leaves are typically fleshy and succulent, adapted to store water in its native habitat. Rhodognaphalopsis nitida is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited to harsh, alpine conditions."
