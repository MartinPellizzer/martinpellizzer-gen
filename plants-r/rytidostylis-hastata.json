It typically grows in swampy or waterlogged habitats, often forming dense stands in marshes and along riverbanks. The plant has linear, grass-like leaves that are usually narrow and have a distinct midrib. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are arranged in a loose panicle, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers. Rytidostylis hastata plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and provides habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
