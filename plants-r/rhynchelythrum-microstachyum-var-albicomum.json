    "intro": "Rhynchelythrum microstachyum var. albicomum, commonly known as the white-stemmed marsh grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in eastern North America. It features slender, erect stems that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence, giving it its distinguishing appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, pale blue to white flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, typically arising from a basal rosette. This variety is adapted to moist, nutrient-poor soils and plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems."
