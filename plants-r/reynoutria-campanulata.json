    "intro": "Reynoutria campanulata, commonly known as the purple stem arrowhead, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to eastern North America. It features heart-shaped, arrowhead-like leaves that are typically green with a distinctive purple stem. The plant produces small, white to pale purple flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in wet or moist environments such as marshes and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, making it both a wetland indicator species and a potential invasive plant in some areas."
