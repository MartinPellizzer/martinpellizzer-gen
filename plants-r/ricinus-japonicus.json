    "intro": "Ricinus japonicus, commonly known as Japanese castor oil plant, is a flowering plant native to Japan and Korea. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves and showy, red bracts that surround its small yellow flowers. The plant produces capsule fruits containing toxic seeds, which are used in traditional medicine and as a source of castor oil. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Ricinus japonicus is also noted for its ability to tolerate partial shade and is relatively easy to grow in garden settings."
