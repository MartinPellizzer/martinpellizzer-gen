    "intro": "Rumohra miqueliana var. narawensis, commonly known as the Naraw\u00e9 bamboo, is a rare grass species native to the Andes region of South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender culms and dense, feathery panicles that produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions, often found in cloud forests. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue that helps it blend into its mountainous habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
