    "intro": "Ruschia stayneri, commonly known as the Stayner's Ruschia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features compact, rosette-shaped foliage with fleshy, blue-green leaves that have a waxy coating. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or red during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
