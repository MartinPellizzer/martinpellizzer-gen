    "intro": "Rhododendron mucronulatum f. ciliatum, commonly known as the Ciliate Leaved Azalea, is a compact evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It features dense, glossy, dark green leaves that are distinctly hairy along the edges, giving it its specific epithet \"ciliatum.\" The plant produces clusters of showy, pink to reddish-purple flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to bloom repeatedly throughout the growing season."
