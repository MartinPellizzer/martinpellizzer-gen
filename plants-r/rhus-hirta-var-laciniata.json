    "intro": "Rhus hirta var. laciniata, commonly known as the serrated smooth sumac, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features compound leaves that are deeply lobed and serrated, giving it a distinctive, feathery appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in panicles, which are followed by red, fuzzy fruits that attract birds and other wildlife. Its leaves and fruits contain toxic compounds, so it should be handled with care. This species is often found in disturbed soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade."
