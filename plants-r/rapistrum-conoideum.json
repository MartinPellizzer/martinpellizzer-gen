    "intro": "Rapistrum conoideum, commonly known as sea rocket, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has alternate, pinnately compound leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hair. It thrives in saline and sandy soils, making it a common sight along shorelines and dunes. Rapistrum conoideum is also known for its edible leaves, which have a mild, peppery flavor similar to watercress."
