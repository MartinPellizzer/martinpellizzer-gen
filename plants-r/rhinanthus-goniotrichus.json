    "intro": "Rhinanthus goniotrichus, commonly known as the yellow rattle, is an annual herbaceous plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients. It typically grows in grassland habitats, often found in meadows and pastures. Its presence is important for promoting biodiversity by reducing the dominance of grasses in these ecosystems."
