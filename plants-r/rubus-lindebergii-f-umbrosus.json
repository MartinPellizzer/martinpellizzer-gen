    "intro": "Rubus lindebergii f. umbrosus, commonly known as the shaded raspberry, is a rare and unique variant of the Rubus genus. It is characterized by its dark, almost black foliage and smaller, more compact fruit compared to typical raspberries. This plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in temperate forests. Its botanical features include serrated leaves and a thorny stem structure typical of many Rubus species. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant."
