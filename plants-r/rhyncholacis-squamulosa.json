    "intro": "Rhyncholacis squamulosa, commonly known as the squamulose rhyncholacis, is a rare and specialized plant belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its unique leaf structure, featuring small, scale-like structures called squamules along the leaf margins. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories or rocky crevices. Its flowers are small and clustered, with a distinctive umbel shape typical of the Apiaceae family. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Rhyncholacis squamulosa is considered a species of conservation concern."
