It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and produces small, edible berries that are often used in local cuisines. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to salt spray and strong winds. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and its flowers are typically pink or white. Rubus litoreus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing food for wildlife."
