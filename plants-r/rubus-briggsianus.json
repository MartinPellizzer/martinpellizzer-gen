    "intro": "Rubus briggsianus, commonly known as the brambleberry, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is native to the southern United States, particularly in Texas and Oklahoma, where it thrives in dry, rocky soils. The plant is characterized by its thorny stems, trifoliate leaves, and small, aggregate fruits that develop from its flowers. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for various wildlife species. Due to its hardiness and adaptability, it is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and open woodlands."
