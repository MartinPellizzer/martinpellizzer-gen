    "intro": "Rottboellia corymbosa subvar. brassii, commonly known as false brome, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It has tufted,\u4e1b\u751f growth habit with slender, hollow stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, pale blue to purple flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open areas such as roadsides and disturbed sites. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense mats make it an effective ground cover but also a potential invasive species in some regions."
