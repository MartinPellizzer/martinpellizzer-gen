    "intro": "Rosa immitis, commonly known as the rough rose, is a species native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring thorny stems and broad, lobed leaves. The plant produces fragrant, pink to red flowers in late spring to early summer, which are followed by oval, woody fruits called hips. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of fine, stiff hairs, contributing to its common name. Rosa immitis is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient plant in dry climates."
