    "intro": "Rhus dissecta, commonly known as the staghorn sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and have a distinctive notched appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by red, fuzzy berries that are a food source for birds and other wildlife. Rhus dissecta thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in disturbed soils along roadsides or in open woodlands. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a common sight in many regions of the eastern United States."
