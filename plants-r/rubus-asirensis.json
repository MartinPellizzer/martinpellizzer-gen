It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, dark red berries that are typically eaten by local wildlife. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and full sun exposure. Due to its hardiness and adaptability, it is often found in forest edges and rocky slopes."
