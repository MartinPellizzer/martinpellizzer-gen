    "intro": "Rubus uniflorus, commonly known as the single-flower bramble, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers. The plant produces aggregate fruits, known as drupes, which are typically red or black when mature. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
