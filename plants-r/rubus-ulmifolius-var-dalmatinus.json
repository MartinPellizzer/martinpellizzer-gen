    "intro": "Rubus ulmifolius var. dalmatinus, commonly known as Dalmatian blackberry, is a variant of the common blackberry species native to the Balkan Peninsula. It is characterized by its dark, glossy leaves and thorny stems, which are typical features of the Rubus genus. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that ripen to a deep purple or black color, often used in local cuisines. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and for commercial use."
