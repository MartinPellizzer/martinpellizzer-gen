    "intro": "Rhamnus alaternus var. vulgaris, commonly known as the common buckthorn, is a shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, oval-shaped leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces black, egg-shaped berries that are a food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it adaptable to various environments. However, it can become invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seed dispersal."
