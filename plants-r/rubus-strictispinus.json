It is native to the mountainous regions of South America, particularly in countries like Argentina and Chile. The plant is characterized by its thorny stems and dense clusters of small, dark purple berries. Its leaves are typically trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it produces white flowers in the spring. The berries are edible, though they are often described as having a tart and slightly astringent flavor."
