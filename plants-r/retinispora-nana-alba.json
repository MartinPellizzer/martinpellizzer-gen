    "intro": "Retinispora nana-alba, commonly known as the white dwarf retinispora, is a small, evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It features compact, rounded growth with dense clusters of small, white flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant has leathery, elliptical leaves that are typically a deep green color, providing a striking contrast to its pale flowers. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and unique appearance, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
