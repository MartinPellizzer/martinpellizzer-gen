    "intro": "Rhynchospora saxisavannicola, commonly known as the sandplain tussockgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in sandy or well-drained soils, typically in open habitats such as sandplains and dunes. Rhynchospora saxisavannicola plays an important role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity in its native range."
