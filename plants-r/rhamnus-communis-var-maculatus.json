    "intro": "Rhamnus communis var. maculatus, commonly known as the spotted buckthorn, is a shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its small, dark green leaves with distinctive white or pale spots. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, followed by black, egg-shaped berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. The varietal form 'maculatus' is distinguished by its unique leaf markings, which set it apart from the typical form of Rhamnus communis."
