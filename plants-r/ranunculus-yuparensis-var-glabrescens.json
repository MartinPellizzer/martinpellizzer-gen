    "intro": "Ranunculus yuparensis var. glabrescens, commonly known as the glabrous buttercup, is a rare flowering plant native to the high Andes of Peru. It is characterized by its delicate, yellow flowers with five petals and a hairy central stigma. The plant typically grows in rocky, alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are palmately divided and covered in fine, soft hairs, which give it a distinctive appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
