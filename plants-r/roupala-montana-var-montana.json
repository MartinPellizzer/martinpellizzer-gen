    "intro": "Roupala montana var. montana, commonly known as the mountain roupala, is a small evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of South America. It typically grows in humid, shaded environments at elevations ranging from 1,000 to 3,000 meters. The plant features dense, leathery leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, occurring in clusters, and it produces small, round berries that are edible for some wildlife. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its compact form and ability to thrive in cooler climates."
