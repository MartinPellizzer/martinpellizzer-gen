    "intro": "Ryania angustifolia, commonly known as the red sandalwood tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically alternate and pinnate, with narrow, elongated leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by distinctive, woody, conical fruits. Its bark and leaves have been used traditionally in herbal medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and antimalarial properties. The species is also valued for its hard, aromatic wood, which is used in carving and as a source of dye."
