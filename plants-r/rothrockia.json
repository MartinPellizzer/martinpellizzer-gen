It is characterized by its showy, daisy-like flowers that typically bloom in shades of purple, blue, or white. These plants are native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. Rothrockia species are adapted to rocky soils and can thrive in harsh, dry environments. They are often used in xeriscaping due to their low water requirements and ornamental value."
