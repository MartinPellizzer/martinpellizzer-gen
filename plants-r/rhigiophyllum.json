    "intro": "Rhigiophyllum, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent petals that resemble the appearance of ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests. Rhigiophyllum has a unique reproductive system, relying on specific pollinators for seed dispersal. Due to its limited habitat and vulnerability to environmental changes, it is classified as an endangered species."
