    "intro": "Rorippa microsperma, commonly known as the narrow-leaved watercress, is a small, aquatic or semi-aquatic plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It typically grows in wetlands, pond margins, and slow-moving streams, preferring shallow water or moist soil. The plant has finely divided, linear leaves that are usually less than 10 cm in length, and it produces small, white or pale yellow flowers with four petals. Its fruits are small, spherical capsules that release tiny seeds when mature. Rorippa microsperma is often found in temperate regions and is adapted to fluctuating water levels and nutrient-rich environments."
