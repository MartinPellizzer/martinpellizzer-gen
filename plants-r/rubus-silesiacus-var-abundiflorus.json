    "intro": "Rubus silesiacus var. abundiflorus, commonly known as the Silesian bramble, is a variant of the bramble genus Rubus native to Central Europe. It is characterized by its dense, thorny growth habit and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers in late spring, which are followed by red, juicy berries in the summer. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, moist environments. This species is often found in hedgerows, woodland edges, and disturbed areas, contributing to local biodiversity."
