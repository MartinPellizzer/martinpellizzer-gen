    "intro": "Rosa hibernicina, commonly known as the Irish rose or the mountain rose, is a species native to the wildflower meadows of Ireland and western Scotland. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring thorny stems and dark green, lobed leaves. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, pink to white flowers in late spring to early summer. Its botanical characteristics include showy, five-petaled blooms and a woody structure typical of the rose family. Rosa hibernicina is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical significance in traditional Irish botany."
