    "intro": "Ruppia trichodes, commonly known as sea onion or sea garlic, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Ruppiaceae. It is characterized by its submerged, ribbon-like leaves that are typically 1\u20133 cm in length. The plant produces small, white flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences, which are usually found near the water surface. Ruppia trichodes is commonly found in brackish and saline waters, such as estuaries and coastal lagoons. Its rhizomes form dense underwater mats, contributing to sediment stabilization and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
