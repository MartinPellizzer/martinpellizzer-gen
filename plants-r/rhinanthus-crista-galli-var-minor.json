    "intro": "Rhinanthus crista-galli var. minor, commonly known as the lesser common tickseed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its bright yellow, tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from the roots of other plants while also performing photosynthesis. It typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and woodland edges. Its delicate appearance and ecological role make it an important species for biodiversity in its native range."
