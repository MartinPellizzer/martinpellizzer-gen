    "intro": "Rubus huillensis, commonly known as the Huill\u00e9n blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the Andean region of South America. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically harvested in the fall. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
