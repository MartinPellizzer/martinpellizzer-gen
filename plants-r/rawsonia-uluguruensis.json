    "intro": "Rawsonia uluguruensis, commonly known as the Uluguru rock rose, is a flowering plant native to the Uluguru Mountains in Tanzania. It is a shrub characterized by its woody stems and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or white. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the mountainous terrain of its native habitat. Its foliage consists of narrow, leathery leaves that help reduce water loss in its arid environment. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its region."
