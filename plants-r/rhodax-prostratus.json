    "intro": "Rhodax prostratus, commonly known as the prostrate rhodax, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It features small, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow flowers during the warmer months. Its succulent stems are often used in traditional medicine by local communities. Rhodax prostratus is well adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils and can thrive with minimal water."
