It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of fragrant, semi-double pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has dark green, ovate leaves with serrated edges, and its stems are covered in thorns. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. This variety is also valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in perfumery and herbal medicine."
