    "intro": "Ricinocarpus adenostachyus, commonly known as the coastal senna, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to coastal regions of southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in sandy soils and saline environments. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces yellow flowers in dense, racemose inflorescences. Its pods are cylindrical and contain several seeds, which are adapted for dispersal by wind. The species is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and its potential use in phytoremediation due to its salt tolerance."
