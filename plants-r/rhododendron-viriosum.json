    "intro": "Rhododendron viriosum, commonly known as the alpine rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Asia, particularly in China and the Himalayas. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows at high altitudes, often in rocky or alpine environments. The plant features dense, leathery leaves that are usually dark green and covered in a fine, waxy coating. Its flowers are typically pink or purple, appearing in clusters and blooming in the spring. Rhododendron viriosum is well adapted to cold climates and is often found in subalpine and alpine zones where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
