    "intro": "Rubus corchorifolius var. pseudoincisus, commonly known as the Japanese blackberry, is a variant of the bramble plant native to Japan. It is characterized by its dark purple to black berries, which are typically small and firm. The plant has thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges, contributing to its rugged appearance. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in regions outside its native habitat."
