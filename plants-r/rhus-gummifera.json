    "intro": "Rhus gummifera, commonly known as the gum tree or gummy sumac, is a shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often arranged in pairs along the stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by bright red, fuzzy fruits. Rhus gummifera is known for its ability to exude a sticky, resinous sap, which has been used historically for various purposes. Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and historical contexts."
