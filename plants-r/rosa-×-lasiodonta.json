    "intro": "Rosa \u00d7 lasiodonta, commonly known as the everblooming roses, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Rosa rugosa and Rosa \u00d7 centifolia. It is characterized by its vigorous growth and ability to produce flowers throughout the growing season. The plant features deep green, serrated leaves and produces fragrant, semi-double to full blooms in shades of pink, red, and white. It is well-suited for coastal gardens due to its salt tolerance and hardiness. The botanical name reflects its hybrid origin and its distinctive, long-lasting floral display."
