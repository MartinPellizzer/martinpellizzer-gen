    "intro": "Rhododendron \u00d7 sekimori, commonly known as the Sekimori rhododendron, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Rhododendron caucasicum and Rhododendron tschilibarum. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of pink to red. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to produce clusters of fragrant blooms in late spring."
