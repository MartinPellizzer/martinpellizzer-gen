    "intro": "Rosa elliptica var. incanescens, commonly known as the silvery rose, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Asia. It is characterized by its elliptical, toothed leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery-white down, giving the plant its varietal name. The flowers are typically pink to red in color, with five petals and a strong, sweet fragrance. It produces oval, red berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. This plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
