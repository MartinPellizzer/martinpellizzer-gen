    "intro": "Rhododendron ochrocalyx, commonly known as the yellow calyx rhododendron, is a species native to the Himalayas, particularly in regions of India and Nepal. It is characterized by its striking yellow bracts that surround the small, tubular flowers, which are typically pink or white. The plant is an evergreen shrub with leathery, dark green leaves that provide a striking contrast to its vibrant floral display. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in mountainous areas with acidic soils. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it is more commonly encountered in its natural habitat."
