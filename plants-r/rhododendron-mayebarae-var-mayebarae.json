    "intro": "Rhododendron mayebarae var. mayebarae, commonly known as the Mayebarae rhododendron, is a rare and endemic species native to the high elevations of Yunnan Province in China. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep pink. The plant thrives in cool, moist, acidic soils and requires partial shade to flourish. Its botanical features include leathery leaves and a compact growth habit, making it a unique addition to specialized gardens. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
