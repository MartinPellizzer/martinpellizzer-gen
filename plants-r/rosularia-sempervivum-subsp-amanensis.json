    "intro": "Rosularia sempervivum subsp. amanensis, commonly known as the Aman's stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the Caucasus region. It is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or alpine settings. Its drought tolerance and compact growth make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and low-maintenance gardens."
