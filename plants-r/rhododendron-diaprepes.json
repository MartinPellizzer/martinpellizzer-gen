    "intro": "Rhododendron diaprepes, commonly known as the Florida flame azalea, is a species native to the southeastern United States. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows in moist, acidic soils, often found in swampy or wetland areas. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink to red in color, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. Rhododendron diaprepes is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
