    "intro": "Rubus procerus var. hedycarpus, commonly known as the red raspberry bush, is a shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and thorny stems, which are covered in fine, soft hairs. The leaves are trifoliate, with three oval-shaped leaflets that have serrated edges. Its flowers are pink to white, appearing in clusters, and the fruit is a red, hairy raspberry that ripens in late summer. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a common sight in woodland edges and disturbed areas."
