    "intro": "Rubus mulleri var. glabrescens, commonly known as the glabrous blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to certain regions of China. It is characterized by its smooth, hairless stems and leaves, which distinguish it from other Rubus species. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically consumed fresh or used in jams and preserves. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and partial shade. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists."
