    "intro": "Ranunculus oligandroides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features showy, yellow flowers with five petals and a central cluster of stamens, typical of the Ranunculaceae family. The plant has delicate, trifoliate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky areas. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
