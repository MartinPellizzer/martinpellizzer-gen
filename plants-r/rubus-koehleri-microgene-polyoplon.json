    "intro": "Rubus koehleri microgene polyoplon, commonly known as the coastal raspberry, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is characterized by its slender, thornless stems and small, aggregate fruits that resemble raspberries. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to salt spray and coastal winds. Its leaves are typically trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it produces white to pale pink flowers in the spring. This species is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to coastal environments and its limited distribution."
