    "intro": "Rosa stylosa subsp. desvauxiana, commonly known as the Desert rose or Desert pink, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit and produces showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has woody stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are adapted to conserve water. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to bloom repeatedly during the growing season."
