    "intro": "Ramphidia, commonly known as the sacred lotus of ancient Egypt, is a plant with striking botanical features. It belongs to the Nelumbonaceae family and is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the surface of still water, while its roots are submerged, absorbing nutrients from the aquatic environment. Ramphidia produces white or pink flowers that open in the early morning and close at dusk. Its unique structure and symbolic significance make it a notable species in both botanical and cultural contexts."
