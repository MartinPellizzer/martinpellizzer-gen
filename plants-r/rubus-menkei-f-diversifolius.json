    "intro": "Rubus menkei f. diversifolius, commonly known as the variable leaf blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to certain regions of Asia. It is characterized by its diverse leaf morphology, which includes variations in shape, size, and venation patterns. The plant produces small, dark berries that are typically edible and have a tart flavor. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for taxonomic study due to its morphological variability. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland or shrubland habitats."
