It is characterized by its slender, thornless stems and small, dark purple to black berries. The plant produces trifoliate leaves with serrated edges and clusters of white flowers in the spring. It thrives in moist, woodland habitats and is often found in the understory of deciduous forests. The berries are edible, though some varieties may have a tart or bitter flavor."
