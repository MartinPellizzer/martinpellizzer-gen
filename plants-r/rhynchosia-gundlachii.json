It is a herbaceous annual that produces bright yellow flowers and distinctive spiny pods. The plant thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in grassland and shrubland habitats. Its seeds are enclosed in three-winged, spiny pods that aid in dispersal by wind and animals. Rhynchosia gundlachii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
