    "intro": "Rubus hastifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaved blackberry, is a species of brambles native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and trifoliate leaves that are narrow and serrated. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black in color. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in hedgerows, woodlands, and along stream banks. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
