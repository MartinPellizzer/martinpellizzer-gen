    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 pseudocorymbosus, commonly known as the blackberry raspberry, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Rubus ursinus (the blackberry) and Rubus idaeus (the red raspberry). It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring thorny stems and pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces aggregate fruits, which are composed of small, drupe-like berries clustered together. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, with five petals and numerous stamens. The plant thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges, thickets, and disturbed soils."
