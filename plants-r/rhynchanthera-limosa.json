    "intro": "Rhynchanthera limosa, commonly known as the swamp orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to wetland and marsh environments in tropical regions. It typically grows in dense clusters, with slender, hairy stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, greenish or yellowish flowers arranged in a spike, which are often overlooked due to their modest appearance. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to thrive in moist, nutrient-poor soils. Rhynchanthera limosa plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and provides habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
