    "intro": "Rosa tomentosa var. duerrnbergeri, commonly known as the Duerrnberger's woolly rose, is a compact, shrub-like species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, grayish-white pubescent foliage and small, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink to white. The plant produces oval, red-orange hips that are edible and contain numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with appropriate conditions."
