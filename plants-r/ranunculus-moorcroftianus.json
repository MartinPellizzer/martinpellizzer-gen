It features showy, yellow flowers with five to eight petals, typically blooming in early summer. The plant has palmately divided leaves that are deeply lobed and covered in fine, silky hairs. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it requires specific conditions to flourish."
