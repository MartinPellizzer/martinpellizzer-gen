    "intro": "Rubus koehleri proles polyoplon, commonly known as the Koehler's raspberry, is a species of bramble native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its compound leaves and clusters of small, aggregate fruits that mature to a red color. The plant produces white to pale yellow flowers in the spring, which are often visited by pollinators such as bees. Its thorny stems and shrub-like growth habit make it a distinctive member of the Rubus genus. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and potential use in traditional medicine."
