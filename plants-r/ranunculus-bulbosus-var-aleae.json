    "intro": "Ranunculus bulbosus var. aleae, commonly known as the Aleutian buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Aleutian Islands of Alaska. It features palmate, finely divided leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of silky hairs. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with five petal-like sepals, which are often mistaken for true petals. It thrives in moist, rocky habitats and is adapted to the cool, coastal climate of its native range. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
