    "intro": "Romulea rollii f. dimera, commonly known as the dwarf romulea, is a rare and striking bulbous plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its compact, low-growing form with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of delicate, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange, typically blooming in late spring. Its bulbs are adapted to survive in dry, rocky environments, and it requires well-drained soil to thrive. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
