    "intro": "Rubus gyamdaensis var. glabriusculus, commonly known as the Gyamda smooth bramble, is a variant of the Rubus genus native to high-altitude regions of Tibet. It is characterized by its glabrous (hairless) stems and foliage, distinguishing it from other varieties in the species. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, temperate climates. Its flowers are usually small, white or pale pink, and it produces edible berries, though they are less commonly consumed by humans. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
