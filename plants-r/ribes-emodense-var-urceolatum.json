    "intro": "Ribes emodense var. urceolatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf currant, is a deciduous shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It features slender, arching stems with alternate, ovate to elliptic leaves that are typically less than 2 inches in length. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are followed by edible, red berries in late summer. Its foliage and berries provide food for various birds and small mammals. This variety is often found in moist, shady habitats such as streambanks and forest edges."
