    "intro": "Rosa montana var. intromissa, commonly known as the Alpine rose, is a compact, low-growing shrub native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features dense, dark green foliage and produces clusters of fragrant, semi-double pink flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant is well adapted to cold climates and thrives in well-drained, acidic soils. It is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental value. Its botanical characteristics make it a popular choice for gardeners seeking a resilient, decorative plant for cooler environments."
