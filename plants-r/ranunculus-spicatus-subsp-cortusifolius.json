    "intro": "Ranunculus spicatus subsp. cortusifolius, commonly known as the creeping buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a low-growing habit with slender, often hairy stems that spread along the ground. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with five petals, typically arranged in a cluster at the ends of the stems. Its leaves are deeply lobed and resemble those of the genus Cortusa, giving it its subspecific name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wet meadows."
