    "intro": "Rigiolepis lanceolata f. sumatrana, commonly known as the Sumatran lanceleaf orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It features elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers with intricate, spurred petals. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on tree trunks or branches in the rainforest canopy. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable but endangered species in its native range."
