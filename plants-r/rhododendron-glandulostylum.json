    "intro": "Rhododendron glandulostylum, commonly known as the Hainan rhododendron, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Hainan Island in China. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and showy, tubular flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows at elevations between 1,000 and 2,000 meters, where it thrives in shaded, moist environments. Its leaves are leathery and have a glossy appearance, while its flowers range in color from white to pink, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
