    "intro": "Rhus heterophylla, commonly known as the variable sumac, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which vary in shape and size along the stem, a feature that gives it its scientific name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring, followed by red, fuzzy fruits that persist into winter. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine, and the plant is adapted to a variety of soil types. Rhus heterophylla plays an important role in providing habitat and food for wildlife in its native range."
