It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients. This subspecies is native to parts of Europe, including Croatia, where it thrives in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and meadows. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and has slender, branched stems. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
