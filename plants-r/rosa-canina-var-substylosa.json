    "intro": "Rosa canina var. substylosa, commonly known as the narrow-styled dog rose, is a botanical variant of the common dog rose. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted stems and smaller, more pointed leaves compared to the typical Rosa canina. The flowers are usually pale pink to white, with five petals and numerous stamens, and they bloom in late spring to early summer. This variety is typically found in woodland edges and hedgerows, where it thrives in partial shade. Its fruits, known as hips, are orange-red and contain a high concentration of vitamin C."
