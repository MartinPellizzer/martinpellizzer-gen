    "intro": "Rhododendron ferrugineum f. plenum, commonly known as the Alpine rose or the alpine rhododendron, is a compact, low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features dense, evergreen foliage with leathery, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, rusty-colored pubescence. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to red, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and prefers cool, humid conditions, often found in alpine or subalpine environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to withstand harsh mountain climates."
