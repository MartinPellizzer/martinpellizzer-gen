    "intro": "Rubia anglica, commonly known as English hogweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, hollow stems that are often reddish in color and covered with fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in umbrella-like inflorescences. Its leaves are large, heart-shaped, and have a distinctive silvery underside. Rubia anglica is often found in moist, disturbed soils along roadsides and in woodland edges."
