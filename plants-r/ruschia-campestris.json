    "intro": "Ruschia campestris, commonly known as the rock fig, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a compact, bushy growth habit with fleshy, gray-green leaves that are often covered in a powdery coating. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by edible, fig-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and arid landscapes. Its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal make it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
