    "intro": "Rostraria berythea, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of soft, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed or cultivated areas. Rostraria berythea is also known for its ability to spread rapidly, making it both a useful forage plant and a potential weed."
