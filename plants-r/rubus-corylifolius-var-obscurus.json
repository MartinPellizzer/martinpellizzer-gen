It is a shrub native to East Asia, particularly China, and is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or black when ripe. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest in both horticulture and ecological studies."
