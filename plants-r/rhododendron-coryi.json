    "intro": "Rhododendron coryi, commonly known as the Yunnan rhododendron, is a species native to China, particularly found in the Yunnan province. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows in mountainous regions with high humidity and cool temperatures. The plant produces clusters of showy, pink to purple flowers in the spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are broad and leathery, providing a dense canopy that helps retain moisture in its natural habitat. Rhododendron coryi is valued for its ornamental beauty and plays an important role in the ecological balance of its native environment."
