    "intro": "Rubus hirtus f. tenuidentatus, commonly known as the slender-leaved blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to parts of North America. It is characterized by its hairy stems and narrow, serrated leaves. The plant produces small, dark purple berries that are typically less showy than those of other Rubus species. It thrives in woodland edges and moist soils, often forming dense thickets. Botanically, it is distinguished by its reduced leaf teeth and compact growth habit."
