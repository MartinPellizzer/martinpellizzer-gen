    "intro": "Ribes parvifolium, commonly known as the alpine gooseberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It features small, ovate leaves with serrated edges and a dense covering of fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, red berries that are edible but often tart. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Ribes parvifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
