    "intro": "Rhynchospora columbiensis, commonly known as the Columbia sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and related plants. The plant typically grows in wet or moist habitats such as marshes, meadows, and along stream banks. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. Rhynchospora columbiensis is often found in association with other wetland plants and plays a role in maintaining the ecological balance of its habitat."
