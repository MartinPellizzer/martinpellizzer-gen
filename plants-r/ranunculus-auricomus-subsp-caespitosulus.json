    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus subsp. caespitosulus, commonly known as the alpine buttercup, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features showy yellow flowers with 5\u201315 petals, often surrounded by a ring of sepals that resemble petals. The plant grows in dense clusters, with stems that are usually hairy and often branched. Its leaves are deeply lobed and covered in fine, soft hairs, which help reduce water loss in its high-altitude habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates, blooming from late spring to early summer."
