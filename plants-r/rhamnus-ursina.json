    "intro": "Rhamnus ursina, commonly known as the bearberry or wolfberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the northern regions of the United States and Canada. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically glossy and dark green. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, which are followed by red berries that are edible for humans and animals. Rhamnus ursina is adapted to grow in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and along stream banks. Its berries contain compounds that have been traditionally used in herbal medicine for their astringent properties."
