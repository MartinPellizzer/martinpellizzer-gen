    "intro": "Rhus rosmarinifolia, commonly known as the Mediterranean buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to southern Europe and northern Africa. It typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters and features small, leathery, elliptical leaves with a glossy green upper surface and a lighter underside. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments. Rhus rosmarinifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to withstand drought conditions."
