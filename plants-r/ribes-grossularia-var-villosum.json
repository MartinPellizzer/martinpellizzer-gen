    "intro": "Ribes grossularia var. villosum, commonly known as the fuzzy currant, is a variant of the currant plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and stems, which give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits known as mulberries, which are typically dark red to black in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas or along stream banks. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated for its edible berries."
