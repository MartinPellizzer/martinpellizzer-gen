It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregated fruits that are typically dark purple to black in color. It thrives in moist, woodland habitats and is often found in the understory of deciduous forests. Due to its aggressive growth habit, it can become invasive in certain areas."
