    "intro": "Reholttumia laevis, commonly known as the smooth reholttum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of eastern North America. It features slender, upright stems that are covered in smooth, hairless foliage. The plant produces small, white to pale purple flowers arranged in clustered inflorescences, typically blooming in early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly waxy texture, which helps reduce water loss. Reholttumia laevis is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks."
