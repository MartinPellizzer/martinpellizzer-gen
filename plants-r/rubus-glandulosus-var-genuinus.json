    "intro": "Rubus glandulosus var. genuinus, commonly known as the smooth blackberry. This variant is characterized by its smooth, glabrous stems and leaves, distinguishing it from other Rubus species that often have hairy or glandular surfaces. It produces small, dark red to black berries that are typically smaller than those of common blackberries. The plant is native to parts of North America and thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and edible fruits, though it can be somewhat invasive in certain regions."
