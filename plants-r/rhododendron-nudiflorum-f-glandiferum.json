    "intro": "Rhododendron nudiflorum f. glandiferum, commonly known as the glandular-flowered form of the nakedflower azalea, is a variant of the rhododendron species native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive glandular hairs on the leaves and stems, which give it its specific epithet \"glandiferum.\" The plant produces showy clusters of pink to red flowers that bloom in early spring before the leaves fully develop. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and long-lasting blooms."
