    "intro": "Rumex mexicanus, commonly known as Mexican sorrel, is a perennial herb native to the Americas. It is characterized by its distinctive arrow-shaped leaves and reddish stems, which are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along streambanks. Mexican sorrel is also noted for its edible leaves, which have a tangy, sour flavor similar to rhubarb."
