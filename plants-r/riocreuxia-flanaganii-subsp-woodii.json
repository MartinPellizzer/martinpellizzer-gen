    "intro": "Riocreuxia flanaganii subsp. woodii, commonly known as the Flanagan's riocreuxia, is a rare and endemic plant species native to specific regions of South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and specialized structures. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. Its foliage consists of narrow, linear leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
