    "intro": "Rumex yungningensis, commonly known as Yungning sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to China. It belongs to the Polygonaceae family, which includes plants known for their distinctive leaf shapes and often edible leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and mountainous regions. Its leaves are characterized by their serrated edges and a tangy, slightly sour flavor, similar to other sorrel species. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
