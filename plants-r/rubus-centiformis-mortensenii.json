    "intro": "Rubus centiformis mortensenii, commonly known as the Mortensen's bramble, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States and is characterized by its dense, thorny growth habit. The plant produces small, white to pink flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, juicy berries in the summer. Its leaves are alternate, compound, and have a serrated edge, typical of many bramble species. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in forest understories."
