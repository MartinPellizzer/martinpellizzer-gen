    "intro": "Romulea bulbocodium, commonly known as the golden bulbous orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its striking yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant features a bulbous underground stem, which stores nutrients and water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. Its leaves are grass-like and often withered during the dormant season. Romulea bulbocodium is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens and dry landscapes."
