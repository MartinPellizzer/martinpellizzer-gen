    "intro": "Rhus tetlatziam, commonly known as the Mexican sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Central America and Mexico. It belongs to the Anacardiaceae family, which includes other species like the poison ivy and cashew. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically divided into several oval-shaped leaflets. Its small, yellowish-green flowers are followed by clusters of red, fuzzy fruits that are edible for some wildlife but can be toxic to humans. Rhus tetlatziam thrives in dry, sunny environments and is often found in disturbed soils or along streambanks."
