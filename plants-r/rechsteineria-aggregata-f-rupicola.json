    "intro": "Rechsteineria aggregata f. rupicola, commonly known as the rock-dwelling rechsteineria, is a rare and specialized plant species adapted to rocky and arid environments. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes many aromatic and sometimes edible plants. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, clustered leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
