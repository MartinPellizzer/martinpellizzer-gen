It is a herbaceous perennial with striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has narrow, gray-green leaves with a fuzzy texture, and its stems are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found along shorelines and dunes. Its resilience to salt spray and wind makes it an important part of coastal ecosystems."
