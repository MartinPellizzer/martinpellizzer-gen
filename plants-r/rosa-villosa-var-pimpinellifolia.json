    "intro": "Rosa villosa var. pimpinellifolia, commonly known as the alpine strawberry rose, is a compact shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a slight red tinge. The plant has hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it its species name \"villosa.\" Its flowers are typically borne in clusters and are known for their delicate, strawberry-like scent. This variety is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in cooler, alpine environments."
