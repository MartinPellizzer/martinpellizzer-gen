    "intro": "Ranunculus monophyllus subsp. boreigenus, commonly known as the Arctic buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Arctic regions of North America and Eurasia. It typically grows in moist, tundra-like environments, often near water bodies such as lakes and rivers. The plant features a rosette of broadly ovate, hairy leaves and produces showy yellow flowers with five petals. It has a short growing season and is adapted to the harsh, cold conditions of its habitat. Its botanical significance lies in its role as an indicator species for Arctic ecosystems and its resilience to extreme environmental conditions."
