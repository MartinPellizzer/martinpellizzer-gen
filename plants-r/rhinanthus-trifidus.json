    "intro": "Rhinanthus trifidus, commonly known as the three-lobed rue-anemone, is a flowering plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It is characterized by its showy, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients. It typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and is found across Europe and parts of Asia. Its leaves are trifid, or three-lobed, giving it its scientific name."
