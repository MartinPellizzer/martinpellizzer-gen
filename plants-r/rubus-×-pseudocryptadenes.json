    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 pseudocryptadenes, commonly known as the blackberry-boys or bramble hybrids, is a complex group of wild plants belonging to the Rosaceae family. It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Rubus ursinus (blackberry) and Rubus chamaemorus (cloudberry), leading to a variety of morphological traits. These plants typically have thorny stems, compound leaves, and aggregate fruits that range from red to black in color. They thrive in moist, temperate climates and are often found in forested areas or along riverbanks. Due to their genetic variability, they are of interest in both horticultural and ecological studies."
