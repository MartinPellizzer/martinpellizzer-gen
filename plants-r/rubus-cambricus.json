    "intro": "Rubus cambricus, commonly known as the Welsh hillberry, is a species of bramble native to the British Isles. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows in woodland edges, heaths, and rocky areas. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in early summer, followed by red, juicy berries in late summer. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the stems are covered in stiff, prickly hairs. Rubus cambricus is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in traditional medicine."
