    "intro": "Rubus eustephanos var. coronarius, commonly known as the red-berried blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is characterized by its dark purple to black fruits, which are typically smaller and more intensely flavored than those of other blackberry varieties. The plant produces compound leaves with serrated edges and grows as a shrub with thorny stems. Its flowers are white and clustered in small umbels, and the fruit develops from the fertilized flower. This variety is valued for both its ornamental appeal and its culinary uses in jams and desserts."
