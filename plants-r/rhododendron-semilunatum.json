    "intro": "Rhododendron semilunatum, commonly known as the moon-shaped rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are often dark green with a slightly hairy underside. The plant produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to white, typically blooming in late spring. It prefers acidic, well-drained soils and thrives in partial to full shade. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation efforts."
