    "intro": "Rubus silvaticus subsp. patuliformis, commonly known as the broad-leaf blackberry, is a species of bramble native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves and dark purple to black berries that ripen in late summer. The plant typically grows in woodland areas, along stream banks, and in other moist, shaded habitats. Its flowers are white and clustered in inflorescences, while its thorny stems are often covered in dense, woolly hairs. This subspecies is valued for both its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
