It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as savannas and rocky areas. Its leaves are generally hairy and have a serrated edge, while the flowers are small and yellowish. Renistipula costaricensis plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for small invertebrates."
