    "intro": "Rhododendron parvifolium f. alpinum, commonly known as the alpine small-leaved rhododendron, is a compact, shrub-like plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It features narrow, leathery leaves that are typically less than 2 centimeters in length, giving it a dense, cushion-like appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to purple, which bloom in early to mid-spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments with acidic soil and partial shade, often growing at high altitudes. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to flourish in challenging alpine conditions."
