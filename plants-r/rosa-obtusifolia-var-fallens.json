    "intro": "Rosa obtusifolia var. fallens, commonly known as the fall-flowering shrub rose, is a deciduous shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and clusters of fragrant, semi-double pink or white flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. The leaves are oval-shaped with serrated edges and a soft, velvety texture. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often used in gardens for its hardiness and ability to thrive in well-drained soil. It requires full sun to partial shade and is relatively low maintenance once established."
