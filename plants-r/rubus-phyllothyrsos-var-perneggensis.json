    "intro": "Rubus phyllothyrsos var. perneggensis, commonly known as the Pernegg raspberry, is a variant of the brambles native to Central Europe. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and thorny stems, typical of the Rubus genus. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are generally red when mature, though they may vary in color depending on the cultivar. Its leaves are trifoliate, with a serrated margin, and it thrives in well-drained soils in full sun. This variety is often cultivated for its edible fruits and ornamental value in gardens."
