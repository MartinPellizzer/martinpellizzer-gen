    "intro": "Rosa glauca subsp. hibernica, commonly known as the Irish rose or the white moor rose, is a subspecies of the meadow rose native to temperate regions of Europe. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring thorned stems and heart-shaped, glossy green leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers with five petals, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its flowers have a delicate fragrance and are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The subspecies is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often found in moist, open habitats like meadows and woodland edges."
