    "intro": "Rotantha floridana, commonly known as the Florida rotantha, is a rare flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils along riverbanks and wetlands, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are small and yellowish, forming dense clusters. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs."
