It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and compact growth habit. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and disturbed soils. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, with a blue-green hue when fresh. Roegneria macrathera is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
