It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage that exhibits a striking golden-yellow color, especially in full sun. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to red, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or woodland settings.
