    "intro": "Rauhocereus riosaniensis subsp. jaenensis, commonly known as the Jaenensis Cactus, is a rare and specialized cactus species native to a limited region in Mexico. It is characterized by its columnar stems that are typically covered with sparse, white spines. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are pollinated by nocturnal insects. Due to its restricted habitat and low population numbers, it is considered endangered. Its botanical study is important for understanding desert plant adaptation and conservation efforts."
