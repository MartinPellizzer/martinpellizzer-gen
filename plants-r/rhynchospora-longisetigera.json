    "intro": "Rhynchospora longisetigera, commonly known as the long-haired sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish or brownish in color, arranged in spikelets. Rhynchospora longisetigera thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems. Its presence is often an indicator of healthy, undisturbed wetland habitats."
