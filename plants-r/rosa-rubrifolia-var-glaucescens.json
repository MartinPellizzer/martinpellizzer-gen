    "intro": "Rosa rubrifolia var. glaucescens, commonly known as the glaucous rose, is a deciduous shrub characterized by its dense, thorny stems and dark green, glossy leaves. The leaves are often covered in a waxy, bluish-white coating, giving them a distinctive appearance. It produces clusters of fragrant, semi-double pink flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, fuzzy hips in the autumn. This variety is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and thrives in well-drained soil with full sun exposure. It is valued for its ornamental beauty and hardy nature in temperate climates."
