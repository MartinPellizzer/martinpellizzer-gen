    "intro": "Racosperma diaphyllodineum, commonly known as the narrow-leafed wattled legume, is a shrub native to the tropical regions of northern Australia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically narrow and have a distinctive waxy coating. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, followed by flat, pod-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in suitable climates."
