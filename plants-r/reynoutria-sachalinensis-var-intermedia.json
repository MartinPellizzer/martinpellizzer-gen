    "intro": "Reynoutria sachalinensis var. intermedia, commonly known as the giant knotweed, is a vigorous perennial plant native to East Asia. It features rhizomatous growth, allowing it to spread rapidly and form dense stands. The plant has large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically green with a slightly hairy texture. Its flowers are small, clustered in cylindrical spikes, and appear in late summer. Due to its aggressive growth, it is considered an invasive species in many regions outside its native range."
