    "intro": "Rhaphidophora subfalcata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf staghorn fern, is a tropical evergreen plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, leathery, strap-like leaves that form a dense rosette, creating a striking visual appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white, followed by edible, fleshy berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and air-purifying qualities. Rhaphidophora subfalcata is well-suited for indoor cultivation and requires well-draining soil and consistent moisture."
