    "intro": "Rosa resinosa var. pyrifera, commonly known as the pyrifera rose, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of pink to white. The plant produces hips, which are red, fleshy fruits containing seeds, and these hips are often used in herbal remedies. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a serrated margin, while the stems are covered in a sticky resin, which gives the species its common name. This plant thrives in sandy soils and is adapted to coastal climates with salt spray and strong winds."
