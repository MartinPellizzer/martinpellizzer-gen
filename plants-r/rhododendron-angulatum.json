    "intro": "Rhododendron angulatum, commonly known as the zigzag rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia, including China, Korea, and Japan. It is characterized by its distinctive zigzagging leaf arrangement, which gives it its common name. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple, typically blooming in late spring. Its leaves are leathery and evergreen, providing year-round foliage. Rhododendron angulatum thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas at high elevations."
