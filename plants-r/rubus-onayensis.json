    "intro": "Rubus onayensis, commonly known as the Onayen raspberry, is a species of bramble native to the Andean region of South America. It belongs to the Rubus genus, which includes many species of flowering plants known for their edible fruits. The plant is characterized by its thorny stems, trifoliate leaves, and small, aggregate fruits that are typically red when mature. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and partial shade. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and understudied species within the Rubus family."
