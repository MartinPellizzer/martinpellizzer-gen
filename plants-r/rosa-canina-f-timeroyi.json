    "intro": "Rosa canina f. timeroyi, commonly known as the Timor rose, is a rare and unique subspecies of the dog rose. It is native to the island of Timor and is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically produces red or pink hips, which are rich in vitamin C and have been used in traditional medicine. Its foliage is dark green and glossy, with thorny stems that provide structural support. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Rosa canina f. timeroyi is considered a vulnerable species."
