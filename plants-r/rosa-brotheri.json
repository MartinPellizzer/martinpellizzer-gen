    "intro": "Rosa brotheri, commonly known as the desert rose or prickly pear rose, is a species of shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of fragrant, pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and its flowers are typically borne on short pedicels. Rosa brotheri is adapted to arid environments, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for xeriscaping. It plays an important role in its native ecosystem, providing nectar for pollinators and shelter for small animals."
