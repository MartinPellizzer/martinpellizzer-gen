    "intro": "Rubus ellipticus var. glabrifolius, commonly known as the smoothleaf blackberry, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its elliptical, smooth-textured leaves and thornless stems, which distinguish it from other Rubus species. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that ripen to a dark purple or black color, typically in late summer. It thrives in sunny to partially shaded environments and is often found in dry, rocky soils. Botanically, it is notable for its simple, alternate leaf arrangement and its role in local ecosystems as a food source for wildlife."
