    "intro": "Rhexia uda, commonly known as the pinkroot, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils and is often found in forest understories or wetlands. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, while its roots are tuberous and contribute to its common name. Rhexia uda plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is valued for its ornamental beauty in native plant gardens."
