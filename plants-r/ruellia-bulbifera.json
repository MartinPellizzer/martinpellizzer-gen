    "intro": "Ruellia bulbifera, commonly known as the bulbous ruellia, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of blue, purple, or white, which bloom from summer to fall. Ruellia bulbifera is known for its ability to form bulb-like structures at the base of the stem, which can help it survive in dry conditions. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
