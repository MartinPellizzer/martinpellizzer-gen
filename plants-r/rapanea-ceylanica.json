    "intro": "Rapanea ceylanica, commonly known as the Ceylon boxwood, is a slow-growing evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by bright red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for various birds and mammals. It is often cultivated as a ornamental plant due to its compact form and year-round foliage. Rapanea ceylanica prefers well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it suitable for shaded garden settings."
