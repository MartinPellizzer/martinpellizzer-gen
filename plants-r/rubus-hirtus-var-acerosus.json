    "intro": "Rubus hirtus var. acerosus, commonly known as the prickly blackberry, is a species of bramble native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its thorny stems and dark purple to black berries that ripen in the fall. The plant typically grows in woodlands, thickets, and along stream banks, preferring moist, well-drained soils. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and its flowers are white with five petals. The fruit is edible when ripe but is often used in jams and preserves due to its tart flavor."
