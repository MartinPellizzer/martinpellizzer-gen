    "intro": "Rubus tomentosus f. densus, commonly known as the dense-furred blackberry, is a compact, thorny shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It features dark green, serrated leaves that are densely covered with white, woolly hair, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in early spring, which are followed by dark purple to black berries in late summer. Its dense foliage and thick, hairy texture make it well adapted to moist, shaded environments. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a source of edible berries."
