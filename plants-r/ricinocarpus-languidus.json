    "intro": "Ricinocarpus languidus, commonly known as the silky oaks, is a member of the family Malvaceae and is native to Australia. It is a large, fast-growing tree that can reach heights of up to 40 meters. The leaves are alternate, simple, and have a distinctive silky texture due to a dense covering of fine hairs. The flowers are small, yellowish, and clustered in spike-like inflorescences, while the fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds. It plays an important ecological role in providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
