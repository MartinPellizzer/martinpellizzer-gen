It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
