    "intro": "Rorippa islandica var. microcarpa, commonly known as the island watercress, is a small, aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to coastal regions of the northern hemisphere. It typically grows in shallow, brackish or freshwater habitats, such as tidal marshes and mudflats. The plant has finely divided, feather-like leaves that are submerged or floating, and it produces small, white or pale yellow flowers. Its reproductive strategy involves wind pollination, and it is often found in association with other halophytic species. The variety microcarpa is distinguished by its smaller, more compact fruit compared to the typical form."
