    "intro": "Rosa urbica f. platyphylloides, commonly known as the flat-leafed dog rose, is a botanical variant of the common dog rose. It is characterized by its broader, flatter leaves compared to the typical form, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant pink flowers that bloom in early summer. It is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and is often found in woodland edges and hedgerows. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest in both horticulture and plant taxonomy."
