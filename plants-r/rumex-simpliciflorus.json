    "intro": "Rumex simpliciflorus, commonly known as narrow-leaved dock, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features upright, hairy stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a distinctive wavy margin. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in moist, fertile soils and is often found in meadows, along streambanks, and in woodland edges. Its leaves are edible but can be quite bitter, and it has been used historically in traditional medicine."
