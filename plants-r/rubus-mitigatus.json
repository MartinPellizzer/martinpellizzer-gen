    "intro": "Rubus mitigatus, commonly known as the soft-bristled blackberry, is a species of brambles native to parts of eastern North America. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically harvested in the fall. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight. Due to its hardy nature, it is often found in woodland edges and thickets."
