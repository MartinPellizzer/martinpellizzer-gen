    "intro": "Rheum palmatum f. rubiflorum, commonly known as the red-flowered rhubarb, is a cultivar of the rhubarb plant native to China. It is characterized by its striking red-pink flowers that appear in early summer, contrasting with its large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces thick, edible stalks that are used in cooking, though the leaves are toxic and should not be consumed. It thrives in cool climates and well-drained soil, often grown as an ornamental plant in gardens. This cultivar is valued for both its aesthetic appeal and culinary uses."
