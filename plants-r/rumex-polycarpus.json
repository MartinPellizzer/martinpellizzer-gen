    "intro": "Rumex polycarpus, commonly known as narrow-leaved dock, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its upright, ribbed stems and alternate, lance-shaped leaves with a waxy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish flowers that are borne on short stalks, typically in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine and as a vegetable, though they contain oxalic acid. Rumex polycarpus thrives in moist, fertile soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks."
