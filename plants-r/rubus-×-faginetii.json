    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 faginetii, commonly known as the blackberry raspberry, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Rubus ursinus (blackberry) and Rubus chamaemorus (cloudberry). It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows in temperate regions, particularly in the northern hemisphere. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are often red or black in color, depending on the variety. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it has thorny stems that help in its identification. The plant is valued for its edible fruits and is sometimes cultivated for both ornamental and culinary purposes."
