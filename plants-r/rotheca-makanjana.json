    "intro": "Rotheca makanjana, commonly known as the African firethorn, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, bright red berries that are highly ornamental. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for coastal and rocky garden settings. Its evergreen nature provides year-round interest, and it is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and visual appeal. The berries, while attractive, are toxic to humans and animals, so caution is advised when handling or consuming them."
