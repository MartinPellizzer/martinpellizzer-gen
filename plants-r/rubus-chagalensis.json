    "intro": "Rubus chagalensis, commonly known as the Chagal blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the highlands of Central America. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically harvested when fully ripe. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
