It belongs to the family Scrophulariaceae and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, tubular flowers. The plant is adapted to survive in dry environments, with hairy leaves that reduce water loss. Its flowers typically bloom in shades of pink or purple, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Rodrigueziella gomezoides is often found in sandy soils and is considered a rare species due to its limited geographic distribution."
