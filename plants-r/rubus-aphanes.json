    "intro": "Rubus aphanes, commonly known as the sand raspberry, is a low-growing shrub native to arid and rocky regions of North America. It has slender, often prostrate stems covered in fine, white hairs. Its small, pale yellow flowers appear in clusters and are followed by small, red berries that are edible but have a sharp, tart flavor. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, dry environments. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in sandy and gravelly habitats."
