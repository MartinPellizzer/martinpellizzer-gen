    "intro": "Rubus grayanus var. glaber, commonly known as the smooth bramble, is a variant of the Rubus genus native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, hairless stems and leaves, which distinguish it from other bramble species. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits known as drupes, typically red or black in color. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils. Due to its ornamental value and ecological role, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
