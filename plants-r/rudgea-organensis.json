    "intro": "Rudgea organensis, commonly known as the organensis rudgea, is a species of flowering plant native to the Andean region of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its woody stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, often with a slight fragrance. Rudgea organensis is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as cloud forests, where it thrives in the cool, humid climate. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a relatively rare and less-studied species."
