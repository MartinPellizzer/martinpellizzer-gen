    "intro": "Rhododendron subulosum, commonly known as the dwarf rhododendron, is a compact evergreen shrub native to the Himalayas. It features dense, dark green foliage with leathery, needle-like leaves that give it a unique appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to white, typically blooming in late spring. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soil and prefers partial shade to full sun. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and woodland plantings."
