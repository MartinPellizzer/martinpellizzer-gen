    "intro": "Rubus ammobius subsp. ammobius, commonly known as the coastal blackberry, is a species of bramble native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and thorny stems, which help it anchor to sandy or rocky soils. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the flowers are white with five petals. This subspecies is adapted to saline and coastal environments, making it a hardy plant in challenging conditions."
