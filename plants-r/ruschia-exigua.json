    "intro": "Ruschia exigua, commonly known as the dwarf firecracker, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features small, tubular leaves that are typically bluish-green with a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces vibrant orange to red flowers in late winter to early spring, attracting pollinators like bees and birds. It thrives in well-draining soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Due to its compact size and ornamental flowers, it is a popular choice for drought-tolerant landscaping."
