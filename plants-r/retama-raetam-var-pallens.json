    "intro": "Retama raetam var. pallens, commonly known as the pale retama, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its small, pale yellow flowers and trifoliate leaves, which are adapted to arid environments. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its growth habit is typically low and sprawling, with woody stems that can persist for several years. The pale retama plays a role in stabilizing soils in semi-arid regions and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
