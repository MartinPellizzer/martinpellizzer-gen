    "intro": "Ranunculus minimus, commonly known as the lesser celandine, is a low-growing perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features glossy, heart-shaped leaves and bright yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in early spring. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread rapidly, making it both a common weed and an indicator of disturbed soils. The flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and the plant is known for its early emergence in the growing season."
