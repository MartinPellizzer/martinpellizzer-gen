    "intro": "Rumex occidentalis var. nanus, commonly known as the dwarf dock, is a compact, herbaceous perennial native to the western United States. It features rosettes of dark green, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving them a velvety texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in dense clusters during the spring and early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows and along stream banks. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens as a low-maintenance plant."
