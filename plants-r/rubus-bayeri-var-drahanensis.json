    "intro": "Rubus bayeri var. drahanensis, commonly known as the Drahanensis blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to specific regions in Eastern Europe. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically harvested in late summer. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and less commonly cultivated species."
