    "intro": "Rubroshorea bullata, commonly known as the redshore flamebush, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking red and orange flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. The plant has woody stems with a rough, bark-like texture, and its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to saline environments, making it a resilient species in coastal habitats. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in gardens, though it remains primarily found in the wild."
