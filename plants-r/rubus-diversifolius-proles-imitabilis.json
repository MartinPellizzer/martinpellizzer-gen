It is characterized by its complex morphology, featuring leaves that closely resemble those of other Rubus species, aiding in its camouflage. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or orange, often mistaken for true raspberries. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, with five petals and numerous stamens. This species is native to specific regions in East Asia and is valued for its ornamental and potential medicinal properties."
