    "intro": "Reichantha cupularis, commonly known as the cupular reichanth, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often in late spring or early summer. Reichantha cupularis thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid tropical or subtropical regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in some areas."
