    "intro": "Rubus tauni, commonly known as the Taunie blackberry, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rosaceae. It is native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, particularly in parts of Europe and Asia. The plant is characterized by its thorny stems, compound leaves, and aggregate fruits that resemble blackberries. It produces small, white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by the development of its edible berries in late summer. Rubus tauni is often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils, where it thrives in partial shade."
