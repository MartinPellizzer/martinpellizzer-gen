It features slender, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of delicate, white or pale pink flowers that resemble snowflakes. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often found in rocky, well-drained soils. It blooms in late summer to early autumn, adding a unique ornamental value to gardens. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
