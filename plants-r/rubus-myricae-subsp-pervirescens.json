It is characterized by its biennial growth habit, with flowering occurring on the previous year's growth. The plant produces aggregate fruits that are typically red when mature, which are edible and often used in jams and preserves. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the stems are armed with stiff, curved prickles. This subspecies is valued for both its ornamental qualities and its culinary uses."
