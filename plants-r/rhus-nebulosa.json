    "intro": "Rhus nebulosa, commonly known as staghorn sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 5 to 11 pairs of serrated leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by red, fuzzy berries that are a food source for birds and mammals. Its bark is rough and fissured, often appearing staghorn-like, which gives it its common name. Rhus nebulosa thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in open woodlands, thickets, and disturbed sites."
