    "intro": "Rafflesia gadutensis, commonly known as the \"Gadutensis Rafflesia,\" is a rare and striking parasitic plant found in the rainforests of Indonesia. It is renowned for producing the world's largest individual flower, which can reach up to 1 meter in diameter. The plant lacks leaves, stems, and roots, relying entirely on its host vine for nutrients. Its flowers emit a strong, unpleasant odor reminiscent of decaying flesh, which attracts flies and other insects for pollination. Despite its dramatic appearance, Rafflesia gadutensis is extremely rare and faces threats from habitat loss and climate change."
