It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its tall, branched stems and showy yellow-orange flowers. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands. Its bloom period occurs in late spring to early summer, attracting various pollinators like bees and butterflies."
