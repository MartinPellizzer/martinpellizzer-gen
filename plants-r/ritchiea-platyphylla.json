    "intro": "Ritchiea platyphylla, commonly known as the flat-leaf cycad, is a unique species native to the tropical rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a dense crown of feathery, pinnate leaves that are broad and flat, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of cycads. Its slow growth rate and long lifespan make it a rare and valuable species in both ecological and horticultural contexts. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is listed as endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
