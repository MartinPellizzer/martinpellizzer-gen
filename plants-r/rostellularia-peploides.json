    "intro": "Rostellularia peploides, commonly known as the coastal sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial that thrives in sandy, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, and it is often found growing in dune environments. Rostellularia peploides plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and supporting local biodiversity."
