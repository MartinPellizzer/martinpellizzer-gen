    "intro": "Rumex dumosus var. dumosiformis, commonly known as the bushy sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features a rosette of broad, heart-shaped leaves with a reddish or purple underside, which are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in late spring, typically greenish-yellow in color, arranged in terminal spikes. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are edible but contain oxalic acid, making them suitable for use in moderation."
