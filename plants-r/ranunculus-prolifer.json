    "intro": "Ranunculus prolifer, commonly known as the spreading buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features delicate, palmate leaves and showy, yellow flowers with prominent black centers. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It spreads via rhizomes, forming dense colonies that can dominate the understory. Its botanical characteristics make it both a popular garden plant and an invasive species in some regions."
