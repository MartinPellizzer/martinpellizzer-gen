    "intro": "Rubus pallidisetus, commonly known as the pale-hairy raspberry, is a species of bramble native to parts of Asia, particularly China. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and thorny stems, which are covered in fine, pale hairs. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red when mature, similar to other raspberry species. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges and a hairy underside. Rubus pallidisetus is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along streambanks."
