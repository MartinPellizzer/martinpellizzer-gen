    "intro": "Rubus urophyllus, commonly known as the alpine raspberry, is a species of bramble native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits known as drupes, which are typically red or yellow in color. It thrives in alpine and subalpine habitats, preferring well-drained, rocky soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific environmental requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
