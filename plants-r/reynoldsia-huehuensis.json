    "intro": "Reynoldsia huehuensis, commonly known as the Huemul orchid, is a rare and endangered plant species native to the Andes of Chile and Argentina. It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its delicate, greenish-yellow flowers and upright, grass-like foliage. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky soils, thriving in cool and humid conditions. Its small size and limited distribution make it particularly vulnerable to habitat loss and climate change. Due to its rarity, it is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
