    "intro": "Radiovittaria minima, commonly known as the miniature fern, is a small, delicate fern species native to tropical regions. It features a compact rosette of leaves that are typically bright green and covered in fine, hairy structures. The plant produces small, spore-bearing leaves called sporangia, which are clustered along the margins of the fronds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistent moisture and well-draining soil. Due to its size and ornamental appeal, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens."
