It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its prickly stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or black in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
