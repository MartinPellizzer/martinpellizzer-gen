    "intro": "Rubus rosifolius f. monophyllus, commonly known as the single-leaved rosehip plant, is a unique variant of the rose family (Rosaceae). It is characterized by its simple, lance-shaped leaves that differ from the typical compound leaves of most Rubus species. The plant produces small, red, berry-like fruits known as rosehips, which are rich in vitamin C. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland or shrubland habitats. This form is notable for its horticultural interest and potential use in ornamental gardening."
