    "intro": "Rubus serpens var. cerchoviensis, commonly known as the Siberian blackberry, is a shrub native to the cold climates of Siberia and northern China. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and thorny stems, which help it anchor to the ground in harsh environments. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically harvested in late summer. Its leaves are compound, with three to five leaflets, and are covered in fine hairs. This variant is notable for its hardiness and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
