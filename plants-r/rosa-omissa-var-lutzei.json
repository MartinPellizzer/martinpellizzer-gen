    "intro": "Rosa omissa var. lutzei, commonly known as the Lutze's rose, is a rare and delicate species native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender stems and small, pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in cloud forests where humidity is high. Its leaves are simple and ovate, with a slightly hairy texture that helps retain moisture. Due to its limited habitat and threatened status, it is considered a conservation concern."
