    "intro": "Rea pinnata var. insignis, commonly known as the golden star hibiscus, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky white hair, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often with a contrasting central spot. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This species is popular in ornamental gardening for its vibrant blooms and unique foliage."
