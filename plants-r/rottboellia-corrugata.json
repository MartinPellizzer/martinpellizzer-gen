    "intro": "Rottboellia corrugata, commonly known as the African carpet grass, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and dense, low-growing foliage. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and have a distinctive corrugated texture, which gives it its scientific name. Rottboellia corrugata is often found in disturbed soils and is considered an invasive species in some areas."
