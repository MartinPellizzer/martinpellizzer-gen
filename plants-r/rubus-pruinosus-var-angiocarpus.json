It is characterized by its densely hairy, often reddish stems and broad, ovate leaves with a glossy upper surface. The plant produces small, white flowers that give way to dark purple to black berries, which are edible but have a tart flavor. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The berries are sometimes used in local cuisines and traditional medicine."
