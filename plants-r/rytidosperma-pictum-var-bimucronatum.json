    "intro": "Rytidosperma pictum var. bimucronatum, commonly known as the two-edged feather grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and long, narrow leaves with a distinct white stripe running along the midrib. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are often clustered at the base of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grassland and savanna habitats. Due to its ornamental appearance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate, feathery foliage."
