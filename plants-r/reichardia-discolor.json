    "intro": "Reichardia discolor, commonly known as the purple marshmallow, is a flowering plant native to wetland areas in North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its fuzzy, purple-tinged leaves and showy, dandelion-like yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist soils along stream banks and wet meadows. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, which help retain moisture in its wetland habitat. Reichardia discolor is an important part of the ecological balance in its native environment, providing food and habitat for various wildlife species."
