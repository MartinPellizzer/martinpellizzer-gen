    "intro": "Ribes setosum, commonly known as the rough gooseberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, tart berries that are typically harvested in late summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have serrated edges, contributing to its ornamental value. Ribes setosum is often found in moist, wooded areas and is valued for both its ecological role and its edible fruits."
