    "intro": "Rubus heterogeneus, commonly known as the heterogeneous blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the western United States. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, dark berries that ripen in late summer. The plant produces compound leaves with serrated edges and typically grows in shrubland habitats. It is closely related to other Rubus species, such as the common blackberry, but differs in its unique genetic variation. Botanically, it is of interest for its potential in horticulture and ecological studies."
