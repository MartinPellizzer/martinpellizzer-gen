    "intro": "Rubus corylifolius nemoralis, commonly known as the broad-leaved blackberry, is a species of bramble native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and thorny stems, which are typical features of the Rubus genus. The plant produces aggregate fruits composed of small, dark purple to black berries that are edible. It thrives in woodland edges and disturbed soils, often forming dense thickets. Botanically, it is distinguished by its complex inflorescence and the presence of persistent stipules along the stem."
