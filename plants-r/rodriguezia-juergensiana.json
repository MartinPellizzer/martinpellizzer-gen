    "intro": "Rodriguezia juergensiana, commonly known as the red hibiscus, is a tropical shrub native to Central America. It is characterized by its striking, velvety red bracts that resemble flowers, though they are actually modified leaves. The plant produces showy, five-petaled yellow flowers that bloom during the rainy season. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes in tropical and subtropical regions."
