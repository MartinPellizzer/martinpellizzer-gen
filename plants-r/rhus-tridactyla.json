    "intro": "Rhus tridactyla, commonly known as the three-toed sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are divided into three leaflets, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by red, fuzzy berries that are an important food source for birds and wildlife. Its bark is smooth and grayish, and it often has a spreading or upright growth habit. Rhus tridactyla is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in woodland edges and open areas."
