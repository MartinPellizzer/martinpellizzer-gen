    "intro": "Rumex peregrinus, commonly known as wandering dock, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its broad, arrow-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous and can become invasive in certain environments. Rumex peregrinus is often found in moist soils along streambanks and in wet meadows."
