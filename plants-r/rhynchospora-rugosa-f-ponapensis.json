    "intro": "Rhynchospora rugosa f. ponapensis, commonly known as the Ponapean rough sedge, is a variant of the rough sedge species native to the Pacific Islands. It is a perennial herb characterized by its rhizomatous growth and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and coastal areas, thriving in moist to submerged soils. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of small, three-lobed flowers, which are usually pale green to reddish in color. This subspecies is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique adaptations to island ecosystems."
