    "intro": "Ranunculus aquatilis subsp. radians, commonly known as the water buttercup, is a herbaceous aquatic plant characterized by its bright yellow flowers and finely divided leaves. It typically grows in shallow freshwater habitats such as ponds, streams, and wet meadows. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that helps it anchor in muddy substrates and absorb nutrients. Its flowers are often short-lived, blooming in early spring before the water temperature rises. The subspecies radians is distinguished by its slightly larger flowers and more robust growth compared to other forms of Ranunculus aquatilis."
