    "intro": "Rosa \u00d7 toddiae, commonly known as the Todd's rose, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Rosa rugosa and Rosa bracteata. It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its robust growth and thorny stems. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are dark green, glossy, and oval-shaped, providing a lush backdrop to the blossoms. Rosa \u00d7 toddiae is well-suited for coastal gardens due to its salt tolerance and ability to thrive in sandy soils."
