    "intro": "Ranunculus pensylvanicus subsp. napaulensis, commonly known as the Indian buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of Asia and the Middle East. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its bright yellow, petal-like sepals that resemble true petals. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and streambanks. Its leaves are palmately divided, and it produces small, clustered flowers in early spring. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly different leaf morphology and geographic distribution compared to the typical R. pensylvanicus."
