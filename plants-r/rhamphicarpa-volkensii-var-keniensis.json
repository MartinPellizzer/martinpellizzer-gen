    "intro": "Rhamphicarpa volkensii var. keniensis, commonly known as the Kenyan orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found primarily in Kenya. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in spring. The plant is a terrestrial orchid with a short, rhizomatous stem and broad, lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and is often found near streams or in humid mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss."
