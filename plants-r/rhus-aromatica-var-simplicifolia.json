    "intro": "Rhus aromatica var. simplicifolia, commonly known as smooth sumac, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It features compound leaves with 15 to 31 pairs of oval, serrated leaflets that turn bright red in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in upright clusters, which are followed by red, fuzzy berries that persist into winter. Smooth sumac thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established. Its aromatic foliage and ornamental berries make it a popular choice for native plant gardens."
