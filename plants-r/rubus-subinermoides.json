    "intro": "Rubus subinermoides, commonly known as the alpine blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and thornless stems, which distinguish it from many other Rubus species. The plant produces small, dark purple berries that are typically edible and have a tart flavor. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it thrives in cool, moist environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant in alpine ecosystems."
