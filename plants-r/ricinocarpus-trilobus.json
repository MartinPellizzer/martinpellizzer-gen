    "intro": "Ricinocarpus trilobus, commonly known as the three-lobed sea bean, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is a small, woody shrub that thrives in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are followed by distinctive three-lobed pods containing flat, bean-like seeds. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss in its salty, windy habitat. The plant plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
