    "intro": "Racosperma areolatum, commonly known as the spotted wattle, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its yellow, fluffy inflorescences that resemble a wattle. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and is often found in sandy or loamy soils. It produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Racosperma areolatum is well adapted to arid environments and is often used in revegetation projects due to its hardiness."
