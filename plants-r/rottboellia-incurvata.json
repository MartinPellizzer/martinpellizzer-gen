    "intro": "Rottboellia incurvata, commonly known as the broadleaf signalgrass, is a tropical and subtropical grass species native to regions across Africa, Asia, and the Americas. It is characterized by its erect, clump-forming growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions, including wetlands and agricultural fields. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it is sometimes considered a weed in cultivated areas."
