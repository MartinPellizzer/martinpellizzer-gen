    "intro": "Rhipidoglossum microphyllum, commonly known as the small-leaved marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces delicate, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinct three-lobed lip, typical of the Orchidaceae family. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, fens, and along the edges of ponds. Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator of healthy wetland ecosystems."
