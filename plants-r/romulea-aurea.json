It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its bulbous underground stem and showy, yellowish-orange flowers. The plant typically blooms in late summer, producing clusters of tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. Romulea aurea is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in Mediterranean climates."
