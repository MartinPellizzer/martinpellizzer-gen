    "intro": "Rubus insuetus, commonly known as the alpine blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, thorny stems and small, dark purple to black berries that ripen in late summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and its flowers are white with five petals. Due to its habitat preferences, it is relatively rare and considered a species of conservation concern in some areas."
