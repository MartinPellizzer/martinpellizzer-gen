    "intro": "Rosa elliptica var. leucantha, commonly known as the white-leafed rose, is a variant of the elliptic rose that exhibits distinctive botanical features. It is characterized by its elliptical, leathery leaves that are predominantly white or pale green, setting it apart from typical rose foliage. The plant produces fragrant, single or semi-double flowers in shades of white to pale pink, usually appearing in late spring to early summer. It is a shrub-like species native to certain regions of Asia, particularly China, where it thrives in temperate climates. Due to its unique leaf coloration and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
