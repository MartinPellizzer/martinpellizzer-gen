    "intro": "Rubus lasiostylus f. tomentosus, commonly known as the woolly blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant characterized by its dense, white tomentum covering its stems and leaves. It is native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States and thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically not as flavorful as other blackberry varieties. Its foliage is broad and serrated, with a hairy texture that distinguishes it from other Rubus species. This form is often found in woodlands and along streambanks, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife."
