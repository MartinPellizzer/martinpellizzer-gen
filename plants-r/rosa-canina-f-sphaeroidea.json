    "intro": "Rosa canina f. sphaeroidea, commonly known as the spherical rose or globe rose, is a botanical variant of the dog rose. It is characterized by its unique, round, and densely packed flower heads that resemble small globes. The plant produces yellow-orange hips that are smaller and more numerous than those of the typical Rosa canina. Its foliage is dark green and slightly hairy, with thorny stems typical of the Rosa genus. This form is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is used in horticulture for its distinctive floral display."
