    "intro": "Rubus costaricanus f. brevisetosus, commonly known as the short-stalked blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to Costa Rica. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and shorter, more robust stems compared to typical Rubus species. The leaves are usually trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the plant produces small, dark purple berries. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in shaded, moist environments. This form is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphological traits and potential ecological significance."
