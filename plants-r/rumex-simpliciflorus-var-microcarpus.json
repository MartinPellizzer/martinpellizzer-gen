    "intro": "Rumex simpliciflorus var. microcarpus, commonly known as the dwarf sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It features basal leaves that are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, with a reddish stem that becomes more prominent as the plant matures. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in spring, which are typically greenish-yellow and arranged in a loose inflorescence. Its leaves are edible and have a sour taste due to the presence of oxalic acid. This variety is often found in moist, shaded woodlands and is valued for its ornamental and culinary uses."
