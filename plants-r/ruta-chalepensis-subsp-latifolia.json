It features aromatic, lance-shaped leaves that are typically broader than those of the typical subspecies. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in umbels, which are followed by narrow, winged fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Due to its medicinal properties and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
