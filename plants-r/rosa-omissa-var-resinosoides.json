    "intro": "Rosa omissa var. resinosoides, commonly known as the resinous rose, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit and produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white. The plant is notable for its glandular hairs that secrete a resinous substance, giving it a distinctive appearance and aroma. Its leaves are typically narrow and have a slightly serrated edge, while its stems are covered in a dense layer of pubescent hairs. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique botanical features."
