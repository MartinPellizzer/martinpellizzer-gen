    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 ancistrophorus, commonly known as the blackberry bramble, is a hybrid species within the Rubus genus, characterized by its thorny stems and aggregate fruits. It is native to eastern North America and thrives in moist, wooded habitats. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically eaten by birds and other wildlife. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it has a vigorous growth habit. Due to its invasive potential, it is often managed in natural areas to prevent ecological disruption."
