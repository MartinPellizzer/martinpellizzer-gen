    "intro": "Rhynchospora cephalantha var. attenuata, commonly known as the slender swamp cord-grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in marshes, swamps, and other moist environments, where it forms dense stands. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often reddish or purple in color, especially at the base. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are clustered in groups, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers. This variant is distinguished by its attenuated (gradually tapering) leaf blades, which set it apart from other varieties within the species."
