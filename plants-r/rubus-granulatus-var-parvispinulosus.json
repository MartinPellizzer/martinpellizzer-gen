    "intro": "Rubus granulatus var. parvispinulosus, commonly known as the small-spined bramble, is a shrub native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its thorny stems and small, trifoliate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits known as drupes, which are typically red or black in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
