    "intro": "Rhinanthus maritimus, commonly known as the sea cowplant, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, characterized by its parasitic nature, though it can also photosynthesize. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shorelines, thriving in saline environments. It produces vibrant yellow flowers in late summer, which attract various pollinators such as bees and flies. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
