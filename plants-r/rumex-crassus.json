    "intro": "Rumex crassus, commonly known as broadleaf sorrel, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often reddish in color, especially when young. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early spring. Its leaves contain oxalic acid, giving them a tart, sour flavor. Rumex crassus is often found in moist, calcareous soils and can be used in cooking or as a medicinal herb."
