    "intro": "Rhinanthus alectorolophus subsp. aschersonianus, commonly known as the yellow rattle, is a flowering plant in the Orobanchaceae family. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially depends on other plants for water and nutrients. The plant is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It typically grows in grassland habitats and is often found in meadows and pastures. Its presence is an indicator of well-managed, biodiverse grassland ecosystems."
