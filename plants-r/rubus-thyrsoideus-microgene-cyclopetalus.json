    "intro": "Rubus thyrsoideus microgene cyclopetalus, commonly known as the microgene cyclopetalus raspberry, is a rare and unique species within the Rubus genus. It is characterized by its small, clustered inflorescences and distinctive, often fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as woodland understories, where it thrives in partial to full shade. Its leaves are usually trifoliate, with serrated edges, and its fruits are small, red berries that mature in late summer. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a botanically significant and ecologically rare species."
