    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus subsp. latifolius, commonly known as the broadleaf buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features basal leaves that are broadly ovate to heart-shaped with a waxy coating, and it produces showy yellow flowers with prominent white veins. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. Its flowers open in the morning and close by midday, a behavior known as nyctinasty. It is an important plant for pollinators and is often found in native plant gardens."
