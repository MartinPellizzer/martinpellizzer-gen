    "intro": "Ricinocarpus urostachyus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved ricin tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its lanceolate leaves and yellowish flowers. The plant produces a toxic latex sap, which contains ricin, a potent protein toxin. It is often found in lowland tropical forests and is valued for its hard wood. Due to its toxic properties, it requires careful handling and is not commonly cultivated for commercial purposes."
