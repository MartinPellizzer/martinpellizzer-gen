    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus subsp. trinus, commonly known as the golden buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It features bright yellow flowers with deeply lobed petals and a hairy stem, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in partial to full sunlight. Its leaves are palmately divided and often covered in fine, soft hairs. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant blooms."
