    "intro": "Rubus recurvans, commonly known as the creeping raspberry, is a perennial shrub native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its trailing stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits known as drupes, which are typically red or yellow when ripe. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it blooms with white to pink flowers in the spring. Rubus recurvans is often found in moist, wooded areas and is valued for its ornamental and ecological benefits."
