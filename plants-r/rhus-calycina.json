    "intro": "Rhus calycina, commonly known as the smooth sumac, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are divided into 10 to 30 pairs of oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by red, fuzzy berries that attract birds and other wildlife. Rhus calycina thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. Its botanical features make it a valuable component of native plant ecosystems."
