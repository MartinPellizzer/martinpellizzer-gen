    "intro": "Rubus silvaticus var. basalticarum, commonly known as the basaltic bramble, is a variant of the common blackberry species native to rocky, nutrient-poor soils. It is characterized by its dense, thorny growth habit and dark green, serrated leaves. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black in color. It thrives in acidic, well-drained environments, often found in mountainous or coastal regions. Due to its unique habitat preferences, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
