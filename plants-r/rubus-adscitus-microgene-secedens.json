    "intro": "Rubus adscitus microgene secedens, commonly known as the creeping raspberry, is a species of bramble native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit, with thin, wiry stems that root at the nodes. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits known as raspberries, which are typically red when ripe. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it thrives in moist, fertile soils. It is often found in woodland edges, hedgerows, and disturbed areas."
