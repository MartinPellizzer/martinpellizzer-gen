    "intro": "Rhipidoglossum longicalcar, commonly known as the long-spurred lily, is a member of the Orchidaceae family. It is a terrestrial herb with a short, creeping rhizome and produces a single, showy, spurred flower. The plant is characterized by its elongated, tubular spur that extends from the base of the lip, a feature typical of many orchids. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The flowers are usually pale green to yellowish in color, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species."
