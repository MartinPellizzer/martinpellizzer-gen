    "intro": "Rhipidoglossum montealenense, commonly known as the Montealegre fern, is a rare and endemic species native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically green with a slight bluish tinge. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in cloud forests at high altitudes. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. Due to its restricted habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change."
