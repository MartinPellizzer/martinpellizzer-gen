    "intro": "Rubus pseudosericatus, commonly known as the silverleaf blackberry, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, thorny stems and dark green, leathery leaves that often have a silvery underside. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that give way to edible, dark purple berries. Native to eastern North America, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and fruit, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and naturalized areas."
