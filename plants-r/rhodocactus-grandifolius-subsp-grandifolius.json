    "intro": "Rhodocactus grandifolius subsp. grandifolius, commonly known as the giant rhodocactus, is a striking member of the Cactaceae family native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, ribbed stems that can grow up to several meters in height, covered in clusters of sharp, spiny tubercles. The plant produces vibrant yellow to orange flowers during the dry season, which are typically borne in the axils of the spines. Its thick, fleshy stems are adapted to store water, making it well-suited for desert environments. Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for collectors and xerophytic gardens."
