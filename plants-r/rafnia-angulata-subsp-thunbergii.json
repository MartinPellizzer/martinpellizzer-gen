It is characterized by its distinctive, horn-like spines along the stems and leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by elongated, fleshy fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both horticultural and ecological studies."
