It is characterized by its smooth, dark green leaves that are glossy and have a somewhat oval shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by red, fleshy fruits that are attractive to birds. It is native to the southeastern United States and thrives in moist, acidic soils. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain environments."
