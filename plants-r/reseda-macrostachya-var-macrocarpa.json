    "intro": "Reseda macrostachya var. macrocarpa, commonly known as the large-fruited sickleweed, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, branching stems covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often covered in a whitish bloom. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by elongated, cylindrical seed pods. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to dry, sandy soils and full sun conditions. It is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its distinctive foliage and historical use in dye production."
