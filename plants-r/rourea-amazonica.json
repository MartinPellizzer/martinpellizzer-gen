    "intro": "Rourea amazonica, commonly known as the Amazonian rourea, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its roots and leaves contain compounds that have been studied for their potential medicinal properties. However, due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
