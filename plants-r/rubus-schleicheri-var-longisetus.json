It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, aggregate fruits. The leaves are usually serrated and covered with dense, stiff hairs, giving the plant its common name. The flowers are typically white or pale pink, and the fruits are edible, though they are often described as having a tart flavor. This variety is valued for both its ornamental qualities and its potential use in local cuisines."
