    "intro": "Rosa canina f. tomentella, commonly known as the woolly dog rose, is a botanical variant of the dog rose. It is characterized by its dense, white-tomentose (fuzzy) covering on the stems and leaves, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The flowers are typically pink to red, with five petals, and are produced in clusters. This form is often found in open habitats such as woodland edges and grasslands. It is a perennial shrub that produces edible hips, which are used in culinary and medicinal applications."
