    "intro": "Rhus trilobata var. trilobata, commonly known as the smooth sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern and central United States. It typically grows to a height of 6 to 15 feet, featuring compound leaves with three to five leaflets that are lobed and serrated. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red, fuzzy berries in the fall. Its leaves and berries contain toxic compounds, making it potentially harmful if ingested. The plant is often found in open woods, fields, and along roadsides, and it plays a role in supporting local wildlife."
