    "intro": "Rosa prostrata var. microtricha, commonly known as the creeping rose or dwarf climbing rose, is a low-growing shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink to white, typically blooming in spring. The plant has slender, trailing stems that can root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground or climb low structures. Its leaves are compound, with five to seven elliptical leaflets, and the foliage is often covered in fine, silky hairs. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partial shade with well-drained soil."
