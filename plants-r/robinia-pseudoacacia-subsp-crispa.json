    "intro": "Robinia pseudoacacia subsp. crispa, commonly known as the crisped false acacia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Balkan Peninsula. It is characterized by its distinctive, doubly serrated leaves that are often curled or crisped, giving it its subspecific name. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers in racemose inflorescences, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its wood is hard and durable, historically used for furniture and tool handles. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
