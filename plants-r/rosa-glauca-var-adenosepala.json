It is characterized by its distinctive blue-pink flowers, which are often more vibrant than those of the typical Rosa glauca. The plant is native to the mountainous regions of China and is known for its compact growth habit and dense foliage. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a decorative shrub. Due to its rarity and unique coloration, it is highly sought after by horticultural enthusiasts and botanists alike."
