    "intro": "Rosa graveolens var. calcarea, commonly known as the rock rose, is a perennial shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and clusters of fragrant, pink to deep red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is often found in rocky or coastal habitats. Its leaves are dark green, leathery, and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers have a strong, sweet fragrance. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and visual impact."
