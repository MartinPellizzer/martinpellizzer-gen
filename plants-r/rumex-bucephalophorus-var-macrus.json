    "intro": "Rumex bucephalophorus var. macrus, commonly known as the broad-leaved dock, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in drier conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish flowers that are typically arranged in a spike-like inflorescence. Its root system is fibrous and can form dense colonies, making it a common weed in disturbed soils. The plant is often found in moist environments such as meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges."
