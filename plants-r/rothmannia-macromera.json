    "intro": "Rothmannia macromera, commonly known as the giant rothmannia, is a striking member of the Rubiaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in woodland and savanna habitats. The plant is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 10 centimeters in diameter, typically displaying vibrant colors such as red, orange, and yellow. Its foliage consists of broad, glossy leaves that are often arranged in whorls around the stem. Rothmannia macromera is valued not only for its ornamental appeal but also for its ecological role in supporting local pollinators."
