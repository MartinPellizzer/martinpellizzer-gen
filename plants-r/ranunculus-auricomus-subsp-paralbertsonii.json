    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus subsp. paralbertsonii, commonly known as the golden buttercup, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its bright yellow petals and deeply lobed leaves, typical of the Ranunculaceae family. The subspecies paralbertsonii is distinguished by its slightly smaller flowers and more compact growth habit compared to the typical form. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. This plant is also notable for its early spring blooming period, making it an important early nectar source for pollinators."
