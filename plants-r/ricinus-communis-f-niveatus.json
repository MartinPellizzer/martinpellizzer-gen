    "intro": "Ricinus communis f. niveatus, commonly known as the white castor plant, is a cultivar of the castor oil plant characterized by its striking white to pale pink bracts. This ornamental plant features large, palmate leaves with a velvety texture and a distinctive reddish underside. The flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically appearing in clusters, while the bracts provide the plant's most notable visual appeal. It thrives in warm, sunny conditions and is often grown for its aesthetic value in gardens. The plant is related to the toxic castor oil plant but is primarily cultivated for its ornamental rather than its medicinal or industrial uses."
