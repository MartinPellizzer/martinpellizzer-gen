    "intro": "Rubus goetzenii var. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth-leaf blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to certain regions of South America. It is characterized by its smooth, less hairy leaves compared to other Rubus species, which distinguishes it botanically. The plant produces aggregate fruits composed of small, dark purple to black drupelets. Its growth habit includes thorny stems and dense, evergreen foliage. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil, making it a resilient shrub in its native habitat."
