    "intro": "Rebutia pygmaea var. mudanensis, commonly known as the Mudanensis Rebutia, is a compact, low-growing cactus native to China. It features short, cylindrical stems that are typically green or blue-green in color, often adorned with white or pale yellow spines. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of yellow, orange, or red during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires plenty of sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is a popular choice among succulent enthusiasts."
