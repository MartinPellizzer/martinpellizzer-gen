    "intro": "Rubus baruthicus, commonly known as Baruth's bramble, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or black in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in forested or shrubland habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species within its native range."
