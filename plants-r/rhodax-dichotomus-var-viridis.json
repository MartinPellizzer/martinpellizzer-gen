    "intro": "Rhodax dichotomus var. viridis, commonly known as the green dichotomous rhodax, is a variant of the dichotomous rhodax, a member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves that give it a delicate, lace-like appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Its botanical features make it an attractive and relatively easy-to-care-for plant for gardeners interested in native flora."
