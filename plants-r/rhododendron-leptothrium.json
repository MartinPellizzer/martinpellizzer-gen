    "intro": "Rhododendron leptothrium, commonly known as the slender-leaved rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and showy, tubular flowers that bloom in shades of pink to purple. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it thrives in partial to full shade. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to conserve moisture in its native habitat. The flowers are primarily pollinated by bees and other insects, contributing to its ecological role in forest ecosystems."
