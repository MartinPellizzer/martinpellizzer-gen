    "intro": "Rubus viridis subsp. preissmannii, commonly known as the green bramble, is a shrub native to parts of southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, thorny stems and trifoliate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by edible, raspberry-like fruits. It thrives in woodland edges and disturbed soils, preferring moist, well-drained conditions. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
