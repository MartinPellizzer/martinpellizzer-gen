    "intro": "Rubus ulmifolius var. albineus, commonly known as the white-berried blackberry, is a variant of the common bramble. It is characterized by its white or pale pink fruits, which contrast with the typical dark berries of its parent species. The plant is a perennial shrub with thorny stems and compound leaves that are similar to those of the elm. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges and hedgerows. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, and it produces edible fruit that is less common than other blackberry varieties."
