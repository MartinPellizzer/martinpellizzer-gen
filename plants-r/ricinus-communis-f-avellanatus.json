    "intro": "Ricinus communis f. avellanatus, commonly known as the walnut-leaved castor bean, is a variant of the castor oil plant characterized by its distinctive, broad, walnut-shaped leaves. This cultivar is notable for its striking foliage, which features a deep green color with a glossy texture and prominent veins. The plant produces spiny capsules that contain toxic seeds, similar to the parent species. While it is primarily cultivated for its ornamental value, it shares the same ecological and toxicological concerns as other Ricinus species. Its growth habit is typically upright, with a height ranging from 1 to 3 meters in optimal conditions."
