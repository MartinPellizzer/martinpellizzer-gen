    "intro": "Rhaphiolepis ferruginea var. serrata, commonly known as the roughleaf cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It features small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine, rusty-colored hairs, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. Its compact growth habit and seasonal color changes make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight."
