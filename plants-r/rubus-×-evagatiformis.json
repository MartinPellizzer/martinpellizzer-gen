It exhibits characteristics of both parent species, featuring thorny stems and compound leaves typical of the Rubus genus. The plant produces aggregate fruits that are typically red or black in color, with a juicy, flavorful pulp. It thrives in temperate climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental and culinary value, it is often cultivated in gardens and for fruit production."
