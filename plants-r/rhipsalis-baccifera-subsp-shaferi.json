    "intro": "Rhipsalis baccifera subsp. shaferi, commonly known as the silver mist cactus, is a species of epiphytic cactus native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its long, slender stems that are often covered in a dense layer of white, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant produces small, white flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for some animals but not for humans. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in greenhouses."
