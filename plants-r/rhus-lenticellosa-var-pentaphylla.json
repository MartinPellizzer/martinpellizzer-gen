    "intro": "Rhus lenticellosa var. pentaphylla, commonly known as the five-leaf sumac, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which typically consist of five to seven elliptical leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by red, fuzzy fruits that are a common food source for birds. Its bark is smooth and gray, with prominent lenticels that aid in gas exchange. This species is often found in open woodlands and along stream banks, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
