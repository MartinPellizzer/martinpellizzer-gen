It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its showy, yellow flowers with five to eight petals. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as marshes and wetlands. It has finely divided, fern-like leaves and is often found in coastal areas. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
