    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus subsp. angustisectus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features delicate, yellow flowers with five broadly spreading sepals that resemble petals. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along streambanks. Its leaves are palmately divided with narrow, elongated lobes, and it produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring. The species is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
