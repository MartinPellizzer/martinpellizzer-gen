    "intro": "Rungia arnottiana, commonly known as the red-flowered balsam, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Brunelliaceae and is characterized by its striking red, tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. The plant typically grows as an erect herb with opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds. Rungia arnottiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
