    "intro": "Rubus pubescens var. vulgaris, commonly known as common blackberry, is a species of brambles native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems, trifoliate leaves, and aggregate fruits that develop from multiple ovaria. The berries are typically dark purple to black when mature and are edible, though they can be quite tart. This plant thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in woodland edges, hedgerows, and disturbed areas. It plays an important role in supporting local wildlife, including birds and insects."
