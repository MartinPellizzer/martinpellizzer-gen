    "intro": "Restrepia kegelii, commonly known as the Kegel's orchid, is a rare and delicate epiphytic orchid native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and intricate, fragrant flowers. The plant typically produces small, greenish-yellow blooms with intricate patterns, often appearing in late winter or early spring. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, organic substrates for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
