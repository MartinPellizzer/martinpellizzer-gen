    "intro": "Ranunculus tenuifolius, commonly known as the slender-leaved buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features delicate, yellow flowers with five petals and a distinctive central pistil, typically blooming in early spring. The plant has finely divided, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. Ranunculus tenuifolius is also known for its medicinal properties, though it can be toxic if ingested in large quantities."
