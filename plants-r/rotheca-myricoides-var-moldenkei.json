    "intro": "Rotheca myricoides var. moldenkei, commonly known as the moldenkei rotheca, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its delicate, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils along the edges of swamps and pine flatwoods. It has small, narrow leaves and produces small, clustered flower heads that are often overlooked due to their modest appearance. This variety is noted for its ecological importance, providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a host plant for certain butterfly species."
