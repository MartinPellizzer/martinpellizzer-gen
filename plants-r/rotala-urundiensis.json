    "intro": "Rotala urundiensis, commonly known as the African waterwheel, is a aquatic plant native to Africa. It features whorled leaves that are often submerged, with some leaves floating on the water surface. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically borne on short stalks. It thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments and is often used in aquariums. Its rapid growth makes it effective for water filtration and oxygenation."
