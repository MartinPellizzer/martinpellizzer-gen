It is native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa, often found in dry, rocky habitats. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, and its leaves are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. Reseda canescens is known for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine. Its ecological role includes providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing soil in arid environments."
