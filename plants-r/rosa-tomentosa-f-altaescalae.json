    "intro": "Rosa tomentosa f. altaescalae, commonly known as the high-altitude woolly rose, is a subspecies of the woolly rose native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, white to greyish pubescence covering its stems and leaves, which helps protect it from harsh alpine conditions. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink to red, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its growth habit is shrub-like, with multiple stems that often form compact, bushy clumps. This subspecies is well adapted to cold, high-altitude environments and is often found in rocky or alpine meadows."
