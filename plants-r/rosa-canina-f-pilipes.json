    "intro": "Rosa canina f. pilipes, commonly known as the hairy rose or bristly dog rose, is a subspecies of the dog rose native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces fragrant, pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fruit, a red, hairy rose hip, is an important food source for wildlife and has been used in traditional medicine. The subspecies is often found in hedgerows, woodlands, and along riverbanks."
