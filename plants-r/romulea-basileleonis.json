    "intro": "Romulea basileleonis, commonly known as the Cyprus glory flower, is a bulbous perennial plant native to Cyprus. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy inflorescences that bloom in late spring. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces vivid yellow or orange flowers with a distinctive, spurred petal. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or limestone habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
