    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus subsp. inconspectiformis, commonly known as the golden shield buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It features bright yellow flowers with five petals, often surrounded by a distinctive, broad leaf that resembles a shield. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and thrives in woodland or meadow habitats. Its leaves are palmately lobed, and the flowers bloom in early spring. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly different leaf shape and flower structure compared to the typical form of Ranunculus auricomus."
