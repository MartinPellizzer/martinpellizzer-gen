It is characterized by its compound leaves that turn bright red in the fall, and its distinctive, rough, horn-like fruiting structures. The plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in disturbed soils along roadsides or in open woodlands. It has a spreading growth habit and can reach heights of up to 15 feet. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen, improving soil fertility."
