    "intro": "Rhus discolor, commonly known as the smooth sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically composed of 11 to 31 pairs of serrated leaflets. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by red, fuzzy berries that persist into the winter. Its bark is smooth and grayish, and it thrives in a variety of soil types, including dry and rocky conditions. Rhus discolor is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to attract wildlife."
