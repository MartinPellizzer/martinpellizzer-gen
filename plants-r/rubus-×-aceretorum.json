It is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Rubus ursinus (the raspberry) and Rubus chamaemorus (the cloudberry). This species is characterized by its dark red to black berries, which are typically smaller than those of pure blackberries. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in northern regions. It has a trailing growth habit and produces fragrant, white flowers in the spring."
