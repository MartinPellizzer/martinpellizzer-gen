    "intro": "Rubus neoebudicus, commonly known as the neoebudic raspberry, is a species of bramble native to the temperate regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or black in color. The plant has pinnately compound leaves with serrated margins and produces white or pale yellow flowers in the spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and underbrush. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
