    "intro": "Restio monocephalus, commonly known as the single-headed restia, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Restionaceae family, which includes many grass-like plants found in coastal and mountainous regions. The plant is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in fynbos vegetation. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
