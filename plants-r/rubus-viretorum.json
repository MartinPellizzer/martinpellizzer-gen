    "intro": "Rubus viretorum, commonly known as the greenleaf blackberry, is a species of bramble native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically a deep green with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, black berries that are edible but have a tart flavor. It thrives in woodland areas and prefers moist, well-drained soils. Rubus viretorum plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing food for wildlife and supporting pollinator activity."
