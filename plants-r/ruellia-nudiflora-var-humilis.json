    "intro": "Ruellia nudiflora var. humilis, commonly known as the small-flowered ruellia, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, branching stems that often grow close to the ground, and its leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are usually blue or purple in color, blooming from late spring to early fall. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for wetland gardens. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a valuable addition to native plant landscapes."
