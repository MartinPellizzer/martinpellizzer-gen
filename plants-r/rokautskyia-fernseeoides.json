    "intro": "Rokautskyia fernseeoides, commonly known as the Schomburgk's fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It features a compact, creeping rhizome with small, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a characteristic feature of ferns. It thrives in cool, moist, and shaded environments, often growing in rocky or forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
