It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, dark berries that ripen in late summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the flowers are white with five petals. The berries are used in local cuisines and have also been studied for their potential medicinal properties."
