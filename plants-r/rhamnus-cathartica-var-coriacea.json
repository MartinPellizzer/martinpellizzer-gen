    "intro": "Rhamnus cathartica var. coriacea, commonly known as common buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features dark green, oval leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during early spring, followed by black, egg-shaped berries in the fall. Its bark is thick, rough, and has a distinctive, almost leather-like texture. This species is known for its medicinal properties, particularly the use of its fruits for laxative effects."
