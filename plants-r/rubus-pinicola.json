    "intro": "Rubus pinicola, commonly known as the pineberry raspberry, is a species of bramble native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and small, yellowish-orange fruits that resemble raspberries but have a distinct, sweet flavor. The plant produces compound leaves with serrated edges and clusters of white flowers that bloom in early summer. Its fruits are typically harvested in late summer and are prized for their unique taste and nutritional value. Rubus pinicola is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and along stream banks."
