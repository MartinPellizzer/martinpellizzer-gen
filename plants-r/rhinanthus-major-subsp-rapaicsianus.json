    "intro": "Rhinanthus major subsp. rapaicsianus, commonly known as the Caucasian yellow rattle, is a flowering plant native to the Caucasus region. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially depends on host plants for water and nutrients. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as grasslands and roadsides. Its subspecific name honors the Caucasus region, reflecting its geographic origin."
