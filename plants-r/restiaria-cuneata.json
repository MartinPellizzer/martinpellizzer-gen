    "intro": "Restiaria cuneata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved restiaria, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on long, slender pedicels. Restiaria cuneata thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and rocky areas. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
