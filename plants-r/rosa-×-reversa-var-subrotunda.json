    "intro": "Rosa \u00d7 reversa var. subrotunda, commonly known as the double-flowered Rosa \u00d7 reversa, is a hybrid rose species characterized by its dense, layered petals that give it a full, almost peony-like appearance. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with thorny stems and dark green, lobed leaves. The plant produces fragrant, semi-double to fully double flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, depending on the cultivar. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, requiring regular watering and pruning to maintain its shape and encourage blooming. This variety is prized for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes."
