    "intro": "Rhaptopetalum depressum, commonly known as the dwarf rock heath, is a low-growing shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact form, with small, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with high salt exposure and strong winds. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
