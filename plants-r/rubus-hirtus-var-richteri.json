    "intro": "Rubus hirtus var. richteri, commonly known as the prickly blackberry, is a deciduous shrub native to parts of North America. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that ripen to a dark purple or black color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or thickets. Due to its hardy nature, it is both an important food source for wildlife and a persistent weed in agricultural settings."
