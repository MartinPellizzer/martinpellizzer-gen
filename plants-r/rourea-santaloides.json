    "intro": "Rourea santaloides, commonly known as the white-veined rourea, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its simple, opposite, and often lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellow, followed by woody capsules containing numerous seeds. It is often found in moist, shaded habitats and is valued for its ornamental leaves, which have a distinctive white or silver vein pattern. Due to its unique foliage, it is cultivated in some horticultural collections, though it is not widely used in commercial landscaping."
