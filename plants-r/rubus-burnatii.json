    "intro": "Rubus burnatii, commonly known as the Burnatii raspberry, is a species of bramble native to the Caucasus region. It is a shrub characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves, typical of the Rubus genus. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are usually red or yellow when ripe. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forested areas or along rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species within its native habitat."
