It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and dark green, serrated leaves. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, deep pink to crimson flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its flowers are typically borne in large, showy inflorescences, which can contain up to 50 or more individual blooms.
