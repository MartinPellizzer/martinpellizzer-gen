    "intro": "Ritterocereus montanus, commonly known as the Mexican night bloomer, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in white, woolly spines. The plant produces large, fragrant white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments. Ritterocereus montanus is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique flowering behavior."
