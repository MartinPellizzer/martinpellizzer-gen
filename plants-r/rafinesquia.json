    "intro": "Rafinesquia, commonly known as the \"Mexican sunflower,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. These plants are native to the southwestern United States and Mexico, where they thrive in rocky and arid environments. Rafinesquia species are characterized by their large, showy yellow or orange flower heads, which are surrounded by leaf-like bracts. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while the stems are often woody and branched. These plants are valued for their ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
