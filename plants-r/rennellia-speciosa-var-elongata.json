    "intro": "Rennellia speciosa var. elongata, commonly known as the long-stemmed beauty, is a striking tropical plant native to the island of Rennell in the South Pacific. It is characterized by its elongated, slender stems and large, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink and white. The leaves are broad and heart-shaped, often with a waxy texture that helps it retain moisture in its humid, coastal habitat. This variant is notable for its unique growth pattern, which includes a climbing habit and the ability to produce multiple flowering shoots from a single stem. Its botanical features make it a valuable subject for both horticultural study and ornamental gardening."
