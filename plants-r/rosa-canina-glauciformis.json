    "intro": "Rosa canina glauciformis, commonly known as the glaucous dog rose, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, red-orange hips that are rich in vitamin C and often used in traditional medicine. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with serrated edges, and the bark is smooth and grayish. Rosa canina glauciformis is adapted to harsh, arid environments and is valued for both its ornamental and medicinal properties."
