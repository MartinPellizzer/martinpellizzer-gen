    "intro": "Racosperma trigonophyllum, commonly known as the narrow-leafed acacia, is a shrub native to Australia. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod fruits. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its small, trifoliate leaves are arranged alternately along the stems, and it produces yellow flowers in clusters. Racosperma trigonophyllum is often used in reforestation and soil stabilization due to its hardy nature."
