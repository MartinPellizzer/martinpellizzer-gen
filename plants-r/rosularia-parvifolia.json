    "intro": "Rosularia parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved rosebush, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It features a dense, cushion-like growth habit with numerous small, fleshy leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces showy, daisy-like flowers in shades of yellow or orange, which bloom in late summer. Rosularia parvifolia is adapted to harsh environments, storing water in its thick leaves and stems. It is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
