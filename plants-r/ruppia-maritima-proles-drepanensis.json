    "intro": "Ruppia maritima proles drepanensis, commonly known as the Mediterranean seagrass, is a marine flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean Sea. It thrives in shallow, brackish waters and is characterized by its dense, ribbon-like leaves that form underwater meadows. The plant plays a crucial role in stabilizing sediment and providing habitat for various marine organisms. It reproduces through both sexual and asexual means, with floating seeds that can drift long distances. Its presence is an indicator of healthy coastal ecosystems."
