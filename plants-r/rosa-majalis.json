    "intro": "Rosa majalis, commonly known as the sweetbriar rose, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of fragrant, white or pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, red-orange hips that contain seeds, which are often used in traditional medicine. Its leaves are compound, consisting of five to seven oval leaflets with serrated edges. Rosa majalis thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it a popular choice for hedging and ornamental gardening."
