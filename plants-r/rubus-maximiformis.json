    "intro": "Rubus maximiformis, commonly known as the giant blackberry, is a species of brambles native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its large, thorny stems and its ability to form dense thickets. The plant produces dark purple to black fruits that are typically harvested in late winter to early spring. Its leaves are compound, with three to five leaflets, and the plant is often found in coastal and heathland environments. Due to its aggressive growth, it is considered a potential weed in some regions."
