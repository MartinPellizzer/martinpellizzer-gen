    "intro": "Rhododendron niveum, commonly known as the white rhododendron, is a species native to the Himalayas, particularly in regions of India and Nepal. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of white to pale pink flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in mountainous areas with high humidity. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, providing a striking contrast to the delicate white blooms. Rhododendron niveum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
