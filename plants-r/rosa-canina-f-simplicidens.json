    "intro": "Rosa canina f. simplicidens, commonly known as the simple-leaved dog rose, is a botanical variant of the common dog rose. It is characterized by its simpler, less lobed leaves compared to the typical form of Rosa canina. The plant produces fragrant pink or white flowers that bloom in spring. Its hips, which are the fruit, are similar to those of the common dog rose but may vary in size and color. This form is often found in woodland edges and open habitats across Europe."
