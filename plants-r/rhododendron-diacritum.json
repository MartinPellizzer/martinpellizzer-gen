    "intro": "Rhododendron diacritum, commonly known as the alpine rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense foliage, which helps it survive in harsh alpine conditions. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often blooming in late spring. Its leaves are typically evergreen, leathery, and arranged in whorls around the stem. Rhododendron diacritum is well adapted to high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil."
