    "intro": "Rhododendron ellipticum, commonly known as the Greek rhododendron, is a flowering shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It features dense, evergreen foliage with elliptical, leathery leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to red, which bloom in late spring. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands and rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens but is also considered an invasive species in some areas."
