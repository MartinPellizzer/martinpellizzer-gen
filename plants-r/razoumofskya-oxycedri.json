    "intro": "Razoumofskya oxycedri, commonly known as the lemon-scented cypress, is a species of coniferous evergreen tree native to the Caucasus region. It is characterized by its narrow, pyramidal shape and scale-like leaves that emit a distinct lemon fragrance when crushed. The plant produces small, blue to purple cones that mature in the second year. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens. Due to its limited natural range, it is considered a rare and endangered species in the wild."
