    "intro": "Rosa irysthonica, commonly known as the irysthonic rose, is a rare species native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant has compound leaves with serrated edges and produces thorny stems typical of many rose species. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sunlight to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
