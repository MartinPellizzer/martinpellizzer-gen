    "intro": "Racosperma filipes, commonly known as the slender-stemmed acacia, is a shrub native to Australia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its thin, wiry stems and small, bipinnate leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular clusters, which are followed by elongated, woody pods containing seeds. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with deep roots that help it survive in dry conditions. Racosperma filipes is often found in sandy soils and is used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature."
