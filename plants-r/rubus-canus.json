It is characterized by its slender, thorny stems and dark green leaves with a silvery underside. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, edible berries in the summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
