    "intro": "Rhinanthus crista-galli var. hirsutus, commonly known as the hairy common tickseed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in whorls along the stem, typically blooming from June to August. It thrives in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands and heaths. This variety is distinguished by its hairy stems and leaves, giving it a rugged appearance."
