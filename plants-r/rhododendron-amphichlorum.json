    "intro": "Rhododendron amphichlorum, commonly known as the dwarf rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Asia, particularly in China and the Himalayas. It is a compact shrub that typically grows to a height of less than one meter, featuring dense, leathery leaves that are dark green on the upper surface and pale or whitish on the underside. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to purple, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and requires partial shade to full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and woodland settings. Due to its ornamental value and habitat specificity, it is also considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
