    "intro": "Rubus idaeus f. erythrochlamydeus, commonly known as the red-chaliced raspberry, is a cultivar of the red raspberry plant. It is characterized by its strikingly red, showy flower clusters that contrast with the typical pink or white blooms of other raspberry varieties. The foliage is dark green and slightly hairy, typical of the Rubus genus. This form is often cultivated for its ornamental value rather than for fruit production. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes."
