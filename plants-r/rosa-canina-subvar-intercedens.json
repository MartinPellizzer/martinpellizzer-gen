    "intro": "Rosa canina subvar. intercedens, commonly known as the dog rose, is a shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of fragrant, pink or white flowers. The plant produces rosehips, which are the fruit and contain high levels of vitamin C. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often found in hedgerows and woodland edges. The botanical features of this variety make it both ornamental and ecologically valuable."
