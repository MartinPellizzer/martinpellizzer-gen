It is native to Central Asia and is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in open, sunny areas and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Roegneria oschensis is often found in disturbed soils and can be an indicator of soil conditions in its native habitat."
