    "intro": "Rubus kolbei var. rhodoleucos, commonly known as the white-flowered blackberry, is a variant of the Rubus genus native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black in color, though the variant is noted for its pale or white flowers. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and partial sunlight. Due to its ornamental value and unique floral characteristics, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens."
