    "intro": "Rumex ambiguus, commonly known as common sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive reddish color and a sour taste due to its high oxalic acid content. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its leaves are edible but should be consumed in moderation due to the presence of oxalates."
