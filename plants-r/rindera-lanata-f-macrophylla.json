    "intro": "Rindera lanata f. macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaved velvetleaf, is a variant of the velvetleaf plant characterized by its larger leaves and hairy texture. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. The plant has a robust root system that allows it to thrive in poor soil conditions. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped with a velvety surface, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers. This species is often considered a weed due to its rapid growth and ability to spread easily."
