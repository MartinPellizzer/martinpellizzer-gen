It features dense, thorny stems and is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves with rounded tips. The plant produces fragrant, pink to white flowers in late spring to early summer. It is well adapted to rocky and dry soils, often growing in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is cultivated in gardens in temperate climates."
