    "intro": "Ricinus communis var. badius, commonly known as the black castor oil plant, is a variant of the castor oil plant native to Africa. It is characterized by its dark green, palmate leaves and distinctive spiny calyces surrounding its flowers. The plant produces small, red, spiny fruits that contain toxic seeds, which are not suitable for human consumption. It thrives in warm, tropical climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The species is also noted for its ability to tolerate poor soil conditions and drought."
