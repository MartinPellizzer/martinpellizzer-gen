    "intro": "Rosa glauca var. bellevallis, commonly known as the Belleville bluebush rose, is a compact, shrub-like species native to the western United States. It features dense, rounded growth with small, pale blue to white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has dark green, leathery leaves that are usually covered in a fine, powdery bloom, giving it a distinctive appearance. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its hardiness and ability to attract pollinators."
