    "intro": "Rosa glauca var. typica, commonly known as the blue rose, is a rare and striking variant of the Rosa glauca species. It is characterized by its pale blue to lavender-colored flowers, which are a result of a genetic mutation affecting pigmentation. The plant is a deciduous shrub with thorny stems and compound leaves, typical of many rose species. It thrives in temperate climates and requires well-drained soil and full sun for optimal growth. Due to its unique coloration, it is highly sought after in horticulture and botanical collections."
