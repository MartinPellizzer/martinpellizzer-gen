    "intro": "Rosa montana, commonly known as the mountain rose, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces clusters of fragrant, semi-double pink or white flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant has dark green, serrated leaves that provide a striking contrast to its showy blooms. Rosa montana is relatively low maintenance and thrives in well-drained soil and full sun. It is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
