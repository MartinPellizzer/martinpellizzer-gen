    "intro": "Rosa arvensis var. pseudorepens, commonly known as the field rose or creeping wild rose, is a perennial shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, often prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread aggressively in disturbed soils. The plant produces small, fragrant pink or white flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are compound, consisting of five to seven oval leaflets with serrated edges. The fruits are pinkish-red hips that mature in autumn, containing seeds dispersed by animals and wind."
