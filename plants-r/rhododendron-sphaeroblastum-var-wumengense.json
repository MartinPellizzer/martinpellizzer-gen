    "intro": "Rhododendron sphaeroblastum var. wumengense, commonly known as the Wumeng rhododendron, is a rare and unique variant native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense clusters of bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and requires a cool, moist climate with high humidity. Its foliage consists of leathery, dark green leaves that provide a striking contrast to the vibrant floral display. Due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity, it is considered a valuable species for botanical study and conservation efforts."
