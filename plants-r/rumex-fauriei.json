    "intro": "Rumex fauriei, commonly known as the Faurie sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Polygonaceae family, which includes other familiar plants like rhubarb and buckthorn. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive reddish coloration on the underside, and it produces small, greenish flowers in clusters. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. The leaves are edible, though they have a sharp, tangy flavor similar to sorrel."
