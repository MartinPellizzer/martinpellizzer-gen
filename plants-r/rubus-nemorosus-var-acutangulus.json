It is characterized by its serrated, acuminate leaves and thorny stems, typical of many Rubus species. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are usually dark purple to black when mature. It thrives in temperate climates, often found in woodlands and disturbed soils. Its botanical features make it a common yet distinctive member of the Rubus family."
