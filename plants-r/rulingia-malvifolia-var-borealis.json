    "intro": "Rulingia malvifolia var. borealis, commonly known as the northern starflower, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic regions of North America. It is characterized by its small, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cold, high-altitude environments. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions. It plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique adaptations to extreme environments."
