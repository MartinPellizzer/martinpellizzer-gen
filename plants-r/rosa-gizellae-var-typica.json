    "intro": "Rosa gizellae var. typica, commonly known as the Gizella rose, is a rare and exquisite shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with slender stems and dense foliage of dark green leaves. The plant produces showy, single or semi-double flowers in shades of pink and white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its botanical features include fragrant, glandular hairs on the stems and leaves, typical of the Rosa genus. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable species in botanical research and conservation efforts."
