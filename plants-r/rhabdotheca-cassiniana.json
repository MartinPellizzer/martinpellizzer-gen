    "intro": "Rhabdotheca cassiniana, commonly known as the Cassin's spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family, which is characterized by its milky sap and often unique floral structures. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The flowers are small and clustered in cyathia, typical of the spurge family, and are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts."
