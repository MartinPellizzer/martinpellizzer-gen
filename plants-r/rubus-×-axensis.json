    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 axensis, commonly known as the blackberry raspberry, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Rubus occidentalis (blackberry) and Rubus idaeus (raspberry). It exhibits characteristics of both parent species, typically producing dark red to black berries that are larger and more flavorful than those of its parents. The plant is a deciduous shrub with thorny stems and pinnately compound leaves, typical of the Rubus genus. It thrives in temperate climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. The berries are often used in culinary applications, including jams, pies, and fresh consumption."
