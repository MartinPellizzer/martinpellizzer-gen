It produces aggregate fruits composed of small, drupe-like berries that turn dark purple to black when mature. The plant is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and thrives in well-drained soils. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, and it is often cultivated for its edible fruits. The subspecies is distinguished by its darker fruit color and slightly different morphology compared to other Rubus species."
