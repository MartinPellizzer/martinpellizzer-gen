    "intro": "Rosa arvensis depauperata, commonly known as the slender dog\u73ab\u7470, is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features narrow, dark green leaves and produces small, pale pink flowers with a delicate scent. The plant is typically found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is often considered a weed. It has a weak stem that lies close to the ground, and its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer. The species is notable for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions and its historical use in traditional medicine."
