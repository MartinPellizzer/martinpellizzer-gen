    "intro": "Rubus ischnophyllus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved blackberry, is a species of brambles native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, thorny stems and small, dark purple to black fruits that ripen in late summer. The plant produces trifoliate leaves with serrated edges, and its flowers are typically white or pale pink. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
