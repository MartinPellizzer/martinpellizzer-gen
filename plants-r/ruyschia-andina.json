    "intro": "Ruyschia andina, commonly known as the Andean ruyschia, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its striking blue or violet bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, often in mountainous regions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. Ruyschia andina is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique floral display."
