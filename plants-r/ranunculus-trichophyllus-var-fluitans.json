    "intro": "Ranunculus trichophyllus var. fluitans, commonly known as the floating water crowfoot, is a aquatic or semi-aquatic flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves that are divided into fine, thread-like segments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers with five petals, typically appearing in early spring. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and lakes. Its roots are often anchored to the bottom of water bodies, while its stems and leaves remain buoyant on the water's surface."
