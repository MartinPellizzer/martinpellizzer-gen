    "intro": "Rumex densiflorus, commonly known as denseflower sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features alternate, heart-shaped leaves with a reddish or purple underside, and it produces clusters of small, greenish flowers in late spring. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats. The leaves are edible but contain oxalic acid, which can be harmful if consumed in large quantities."
