    "intro": "Rhododendron prophantum, commonly known as the Himalayan rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Asia, particularly in Nepal, Bhutan, and northern India. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows at high elevations, often in moist, shaded forest environments. The plant features dense, leathery leaves and produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink and white during the spring. Its botanical characteristics include a woody stem, opposite leaf arrangement, and a preference for acidic soils. Rhododendron prophantum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in its native habitat."
