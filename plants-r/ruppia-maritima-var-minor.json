It is a halophyte, meaning it thrives in saline environments such as salt marshes and tidal flats. The plant has small, green leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer. Its roots are adapted to tolerate waterlogged and salty soils. It plays a role in stabilizing coastal sediments and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
