    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 burlatsensis, commonly known as the blackberry bramble, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Rubus fruticosus and Rubus ulmifolius. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves that are typically trifoliate or pinnate. The plant produces aggregate fruits composed of small, juicy drupes that are usually dark purple to black in color. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges, hedgerows, and disturbed soils. Due to its vigorous growth, it can become invasive in certain regions if not managed properly."
