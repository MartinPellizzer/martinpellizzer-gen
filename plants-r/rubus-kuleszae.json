    "intro": "[WRONG START] Rubus kuleszaa, commonly known as Kulesza's raspberry, is a species of bramble native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red when ripe, similar to other raspberries. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
