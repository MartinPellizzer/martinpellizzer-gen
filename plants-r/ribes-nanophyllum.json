    "intro": "Ribes nanophyllum, commonly known as the small-leaf gooseberry, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in length. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are followed by edible, tart berries in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
