    "intro": "Rhyncholacis unguifera, commonly known as the clawed rhyncholacis, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many species of shrubs and climbers. The plant is characterized by its distinctive, claw-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. Its small, clustered flowers are typically white or pale yellow, and it produces small, fleshy fruits that are adapted for dispersal by animals. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Rhyncholacis unguifera is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
