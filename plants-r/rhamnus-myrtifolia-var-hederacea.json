    "intro": "Rhamnus myrtifolia var. hederacea, commonly known as the creeping buckthorn, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing habit with dark green, oval leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by dark blue berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it adaptable to various environments. Its botanical features make it an important component of Mediterranean flora and a subject of ecological study."
