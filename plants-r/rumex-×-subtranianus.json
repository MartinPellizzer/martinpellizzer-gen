    "intro": "Rumex \u00d7 subtranianus, commonly known as the hybrid sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant that exhibits characteristics of both Rumex acetosa (common sorrel) and Rumex acetobipinus (broad-leafed sorrel). It typically features heart-shaped leaves with a reddish or purple tinge along the veins, and it produces small, greenish flowers in clusters. The plant thrives in moist, fertile soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. It is valued for its edible leaves, which have a tangy, sour flavor due to the presence of oxalic acid. However, due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural and natural settings."
