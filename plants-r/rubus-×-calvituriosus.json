    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 calvituriosus, commonly known as the California blackberry, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Rubus ursinus and Rubus pectoralis. It is a thorny shrub native to coastal areas of California, characterized by its trailing growth habit and dark purple to black berries. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically harvested when fully ripe for their sweet, tart flavor. Botanically, it features trifoliate leaves and has a complex reproductive system due to its hybrid origin. It is valued for both its ornamental appeal and its use in local agriculture."
