    "intro": "Rosa hystrix, commonly known as the prickly rose, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and clusters of fragrant, pink to red flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, with dark green, glossy leaves that are deeply lobed. Its botanical features include stipules that are often enlarged and leaf-like, and it produces red or orange hips that contain seeds. Rosa hystrix is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its visual and aromatic qualities."
