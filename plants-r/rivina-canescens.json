    "intro": "Rivina canescens, commonly known as the silverleaf rivina, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a shrub that typically grows in wetlands and along stream banks, thriving in moist, sandy soils. The plant produces small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are covered in fine, silvery hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Rivina canescens is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
