    "intro": "Rumex patientia subsp. recurvatus, commonly known as the recurved dock, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in wet meadows, stream banks, and marshy areas. The plant has alternate, lance-shaped leaves with a reddish or purple underside, and it produces small, greenish flowers in clusters during the spring. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a persistent weed in agricultural and natural habitats. The species is characterized by its distinctive recurved leaf tips and is valued for its historical use in herbal medicine."
