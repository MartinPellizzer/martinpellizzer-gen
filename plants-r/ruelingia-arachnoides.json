    "intro": "Ruelingia arachnoides, commonly known as the velvetleaf or spiderplant, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its hairy, waxy leaves that give it a distinctive velvety appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are often clustered in spikes. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Ruelingia arachnoides is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories."
