    "intro": "Rorippa \u00d7 schwimmeri, commonly known as the hybrid watercress, is a flowering plant in the Brassicaceae family. It is a natural hybrid between Rorippa amphibia and Rorippa islandica, characterized by its aquatic or semi-aquatic growth habit. The plant typically has finely divided, thread-like leaves that float on the water surface, supported by slender, branching stems. It produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by small, round pods containing seeds. This species is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and ditches."
