    "intro": "Richetia subcylindrica, commonly known as the slender rock cress, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in crevices or on slopes, and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant has a basal rosette of narrow, linear leaves and produces small, yellowish-white flowers in early spring. It is characterized by its subcylindrical stem, which is often covered in fine hairs. Richetia subcylindrica is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with similar floral structures."
