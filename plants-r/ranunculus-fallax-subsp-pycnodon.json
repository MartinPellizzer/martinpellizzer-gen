    "intro": "Ranunculus fallax subsp. pycnodon, commonly known as the narrow-leaved buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves that are typically dark green and slightly succulent. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with five broadly spreading petals, often with a distinctive central tuft of hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its ornamental value and unique foliage, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in some regions."
