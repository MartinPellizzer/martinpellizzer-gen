    "intro": "Rhizophora obtusa, commonly known as the broad-leaved mangrove, is a species of mangrove tree native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its extensive root system, which includes prop roots that help stabilize the tree in waterlogged, saline soils. The plant has thick, waxy leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in its salty environment. It produces small, red berries that are an important food source for various bird and marine species. Rhizophora obtusa plays a crucial role in coastal ecosystems by preventing erosion and providing habitat for aquatic life."
