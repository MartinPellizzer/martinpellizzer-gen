    "intro": "Rindera graeca var. incana, commonly known as the woolly rindera, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its hairy, silver-gray foliage, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or limestone-rich habitats. Its unique appearance and hardy nature make it a distinctive addition to alpine gardens."
