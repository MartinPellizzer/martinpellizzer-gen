    "intro": "Rosa tomentella var. woronowii, commonly known as the woolly rose, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and small, fragrant pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. Its leaves are covered in a thick layer of white to gray hairs, which help to reduce water loss in arid conditions. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in colder climates."
