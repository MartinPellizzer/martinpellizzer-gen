    "intro": "Rubus craponensis, commonly known as the Craponensian blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its prickly stems and clusters of small, dark purple to black berries. The plant produces compound leaves with serrated edges and white to pale pink flowers that bloom in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
