    "intro": "Rhynchospora rupicola, commonly known as the rock marsh sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh habitats in North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, commonly referred to as the sedge family, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish or brownish in color, which are pollinated by wind or insects. Rhynchospora rupicola thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in areas with standing water or saturated ground. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
