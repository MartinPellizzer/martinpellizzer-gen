It features dense, grass-like foliage with narrow, linear leaves that are typically bright green. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, often in shades of white or pale pink. It thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Its compact size and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and shaded borders."
