    "intro": "Rhinanthus angustifolius var. polycladus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved red clover, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its typical pea-like flowers and nitrogen-fixing ability. The plant has slender, erect stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy. It produces bright yellow flowers in clusters, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. This variant is distinguished by its narrower leaves compared to the typical form of Rhinanthus angustifolius."
