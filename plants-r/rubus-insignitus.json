It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces small, edible berries that are often used in local cuisines. Its leaves are simple, ovate, and have a slightly serrated edge. Rubus insignitus thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments."
