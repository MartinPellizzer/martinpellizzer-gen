    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 multiformis, commonly known as the trailing blackberry, is a hybrid plant within the Rubus genus. It is characterized by its thorny stems and aggregate fruits that develop from multiple ovaria. The plant is native to the western United States and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and streambanks. It has small, serrated leaves and produces dark purple to black berries that are typically edible. Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural and natural settings."
