    "intro": "Rhododendron canadense f. albiflorum, commonly known as the white-flowered Canadian rhododendron, is a variant of the Canadian rhododendron native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its broad, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces showy, clustered white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It prefers acidic, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its botanical interest lies in its distinctive floral coloration and its role in the natural flora of its native habitat."
