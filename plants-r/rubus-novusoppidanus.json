    "intro": "Rubus novusoppidanus, commonly known as the New Oppidan Raspberry, is a species of brambles native to the temperate regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or black in color. The plant has trifoliate leaves with serrated edges and thorny stems, typical of many Rubus species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant in its native habitat."
