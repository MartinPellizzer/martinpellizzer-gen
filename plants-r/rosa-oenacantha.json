    "intro": "Rosa oenacantha, commonly known as the narrowleaf rock rose, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, often thornless stems and small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces rose-like blooms in late spring to early summer, which are typically borne on long pedicels. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. Rosa oenacantha is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
