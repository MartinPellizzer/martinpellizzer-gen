    "intro": "Rosa urbica var. subglabra, commonly known as the smooth urban rose, is a variant of the common rose that thrives in urban environments. It is characterized by its smooth, hairless stems and leaves, which distinguish it from other Rosa species. The plant produces fragrant, pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is well adapted to withstand pollution and compacted soil, making it a hardy choice for city gardens. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for study in urban ecology and horticulture."
