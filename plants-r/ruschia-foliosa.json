It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white or silver hairs, giving it its distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of red, orange, or yellow during the warmer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements make it an ideal plant for arid climates."
