It features dense, dark green foliage with a distinctive silver-white underside, giving it a striking, almost metallic appearance. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink and white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for rock gardens and shaded borders. The f. amethystinum form is noted for its enhanced foliage coloration compared to the species."
