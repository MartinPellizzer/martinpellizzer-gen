    "intro": "Rhynchostele pygmaea, commonly known as the small-stemmed rhynchostele, is a rare and diminutive fern species characterized by its compact growth habit. It possesses a unique rhynchostele, a type of vascular bundle arrangement typical of certain primitive ferns, which is centrally located within its stem. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in tropical or subtropical regions with high humidity. Its fronds are usually small and delicate, with a feathery appearance, and it produces sporangia on the undersides of its leaves. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Rhynchostele pygmaea is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
