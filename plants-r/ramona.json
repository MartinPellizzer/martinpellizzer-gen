    "intro": "Ramona, commonly known as the Ramona plant or *Euphorbia ramonae*, is a succulent species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States. It features a short, woody stem with thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring, adding a subtle ornamental value. Its growth habit is compact, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a container plant. Due to its slow growth and drought tolerance, it requires minimal care once established."
