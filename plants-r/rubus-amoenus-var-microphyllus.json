    "intro": "Rubus amoenus var. microphyllus, commonly known as the miniature raspberry, is a compact shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its small, trifoliate leaves and clusters of tiny, red berries that ripen in late summer. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight. Its botanical features include thorny stems and a dense growth habit, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Due to its limited range, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
