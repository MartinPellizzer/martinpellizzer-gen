    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 consanguis, commonly known as the blackberry raspberry, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Rubus ursinus (the blackberry) and Rubus chamaemorus (the cloudberry). It is characterized by its thorny stems and aggregate fruits that develop from multiple ovaries. The plant thrives in temperate climates and is often found in moist, acidic soils. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it produces small, yellowish flowers in the spring. The fruit, which ripens in late summer, is prized for its tart flavor and is used in culinary applications."
