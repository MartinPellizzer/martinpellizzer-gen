It is native to the mountainous regions of Central America, particularly in countries like Guatemala and Honduras. The plant is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves, typical of the Rubus genus. It produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or black in color. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
