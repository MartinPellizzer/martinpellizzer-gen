    "intro": "Rainiera, commonly known as the blue rain flower, is a striking plant native to the coastal regions of southern California. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its vibrant blue and purple petals. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in its arid environment. Rainiera thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
