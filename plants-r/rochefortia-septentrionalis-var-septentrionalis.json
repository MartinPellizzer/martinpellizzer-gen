    "intro": "Rochefortia septentrionalis var. septentrionalis, commonly known as the desert bell, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as deserts and rocky slopes. The plant features showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are small, narrow, and often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to survive in harsh, dry conditions."
