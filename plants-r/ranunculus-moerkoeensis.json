It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family, known for its showy, often brightly colored flowers. The plant features delicate, palmate leaves and produces small, yellow flowers with numerous stamens. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its mountainous habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
