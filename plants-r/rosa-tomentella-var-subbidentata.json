    "intro": "Rosa tomentella var. subbidentata, commonly known as the woolly rose, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly gray foliage and small, fragrant pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rocky or alpine environments. Its stems are covered in a soft, fuzzy layer of hairs, which helps to retain moisture and protect against harsh weather. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with specific horticultural conditions."
