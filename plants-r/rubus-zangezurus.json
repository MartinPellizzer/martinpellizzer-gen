    "intro": "Rubus zangezurus, commonly known as the Zangezur raspberry, is a species of brambles native to the Caucasus region. It is characterized by its trailing or shrub-like growth habit and produces small, aggregate fruits. The plant has pinnately lobed leaves and thorny stems, typical of many Rubus species. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges and rocky areas. The fruits are edible and have a flavor similar to other raspberries, though they are less commonly cultivated."
