    "intro": "Rosa hezhangensis, commonly known as the Hezhang rose, is a rare and endemic species native to China. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its fragrant, pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in mountainous regions with cool, humid climates, often in forested areas. Its leaves are compound, with serrated edges, and its stems are covered in thorny projections. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Rosa hezhangensis is considered a conservation concern."
