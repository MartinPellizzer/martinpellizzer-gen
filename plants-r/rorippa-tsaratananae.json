    "intro": "Rorippa tsaratananae, commonly known as the Tsaratanana watercress, is a rare aquatic plant endemic to Madagascar. It is characterized by its small, floating leaves that are typically less than 1 centimeter in diameter. The plant produces tiny white flowers that bloom in late summer, and it is often found in freshwater habitats such as ponds and marshes. Its unique morphology and restricted distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered vulnerable and requires careful protection."
