It features small, rounded stems that are typically green with a slightly woolly texture. The plant produces clusters of delicate, violet-pink flowers during the spring and summer months. Its foliage is often covered in a fine layer of white to pale blue hairs, giving it a soft appearance. This cultivar is prized for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in a well-draining soil environment."
