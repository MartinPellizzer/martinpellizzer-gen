    "intro": "Ranunculus hydrocharoides var. natans, commonly known as water buttercup, is a floating aquatic plant native to freshwater habitats in Europe and Asia. It features small, yellow flowers with five petals and numerous stamens, typical of the Ranunculaceae family. The plant has broad, floating leaves that help it stay buoyant on the water's surface. Its root system is adapted for nutrient absorption from the water column. It plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and serving as a food source for waterfowl."
