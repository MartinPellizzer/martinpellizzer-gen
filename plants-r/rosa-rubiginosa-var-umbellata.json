It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and clusters of fragrant, pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, oval-shaped leaves with serrated edges, and its flowers are often borne in umbels, giving it its specific variety name. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for coastal and dry garden environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
