    "intro": "Rheum macrocarpum, commonly known as the giant rhubarb, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features large, waxy, arrowhead-shaped leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in length, with a deep green color and a hairy texture. The plant produces tall, reddish stems that bear clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring. Its rhubarb-like stalks are edible, though they are typically too fibrous and tart for culinary use. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its striking foliage."
