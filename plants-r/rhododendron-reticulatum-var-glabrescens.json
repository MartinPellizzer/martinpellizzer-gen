    "intro": "Rhododendron reticulatum var. glabrescens, commonly known as the glabrous rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, with a smooth, glabrous surface, giving it its varietal name. The flowers, which range in color from white to pink, are highly fragrant and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
