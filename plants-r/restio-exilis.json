It is a grass-like plant characterized by its narrow, cylindrical leaves and unbranched stems. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to sandy or rocky soils. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often clustered at the base of the stem. Due to its delicate appearance and ecological importance, it is often found in fynbos vegetation."
