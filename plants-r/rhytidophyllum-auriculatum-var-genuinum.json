    "intro": "Rhytidophyllum auriculatum var. genuinum, commonly known as the golden bell plant, is a rare and striking species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often resembling small bells. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is a prized specimen among collectors and botanists."
