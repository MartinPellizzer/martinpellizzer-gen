    "intro": "Rubus bavaricus var. ursinus, commonly known as the bearberry raspberry, is a shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or black in color, resembling raspberries but with a more acidic flavor. The plant has compound leaves with serrated edges and thorny stems, typical of the Rubus genus. It thrives in woodland areas and is often found in moist, shaded environments. The berries are edible but should be consumed in moderation due to their tartness and potential for causing digestive discomfort."
