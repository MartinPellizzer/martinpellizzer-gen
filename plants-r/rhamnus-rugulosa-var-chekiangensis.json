It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, giving them a distinctive, glossy appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by dark blue berries that are edible for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas or along streambanks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
