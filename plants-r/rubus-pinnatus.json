    "intro": "Rubus pinnatus, commonly known as the evergreen blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its thorny stems, trifoliate leaves, and small, dark purple to black berries. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in forest understories. Its berries are edible, though they are generally less flavorful compared to other blackberry species. The plant has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
