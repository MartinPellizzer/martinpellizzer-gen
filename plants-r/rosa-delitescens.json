    "intro": "Rosa delitescens, commonly known as the \"fading rose,\" is a species of climbing shrub native to China. It is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a subtle, almost translucent appearance. The plant produces small, oval leaves with a slightly serrated edge, and its stems are covered in fine, silken hairs. Rosa delitescens is known for its short blooming period, typically in spring, and its flowers tend to fade quickly, giving it its common name. It is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and unique floral characteristics."
