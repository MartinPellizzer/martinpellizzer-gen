    "intro": "Rubus bercheriensis, commonly known as the Bercher's blackberry, is a species of brambles native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically edible. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and partial shade. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and lesser-known member of the Rubus genus."
