    "intro": "Rubus tumularis, commonly known as the field raspberry, is a species of brambles native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows in open woodlands, grasslands, and along roadsides. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are usually red or yellow in color, with a tart flavor. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it has thorny stems that help in its identification. The plant is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions."
