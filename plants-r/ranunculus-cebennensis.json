    "intro": "Ranunculus cebennensis, commonly known as the alpine buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky habitats, thriving in cool, moist environments. The plant features basal leaves that are palmately lobed and bright yellow flowers with five to eight petals. It is part of the Ranunculaceae family, known for its showy, often colorful blooms. Due to its habitat preferences, it is often found at high altitudes where competition from other plants is limited."
