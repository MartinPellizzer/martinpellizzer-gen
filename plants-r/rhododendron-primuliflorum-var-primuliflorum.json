    "intro": "Rhododendron primuliflorum var. primuliflorum, commonly known as the alpine rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense foliage, often forming thickets in its natural habitat. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, blooming in early spring. Its leaves are typically dark green and leathery, providing a striking contrast to the flowers. This variety is well adapted to cool, moist environments and thrives in acidic, well-drained soils."
