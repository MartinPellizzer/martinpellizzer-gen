    "intro": "Rubus nitens, commonly known as the silverleaf bramble, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its finely hairy, silvery-gray leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers in the spring, followed by red, juicy berries in the summer. Its stems are thorny and covered with a dense layer of fine hairs. Rubus nitens thrives in moist, wooded areas and is often found in the understory of forests."
