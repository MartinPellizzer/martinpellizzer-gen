It features showy, bright yellow flowers with five to nine petals, typically borne on slender, branched stems. The plant has palmately lobed leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain environments."
