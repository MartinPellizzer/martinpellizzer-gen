    "intro": "Ricinocarpus carthagenensis, commonly known as the Caribbean beach hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in sandy or saline soils, often near the shoreline. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers that are usually pink or red in color, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a rough texture, while its fruits are capsule-like structures containing numerous seeds. Ricinocarpus carthagenensis is well adapted to coastal environments and plays a role in stabilizing dune ecosystems."
