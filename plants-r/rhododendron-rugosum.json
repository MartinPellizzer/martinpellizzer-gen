    "intro": "Rhododendron rugosum, commonly known as the roughleaf rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of western China. It is characterized by its leathery, often hairy leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces showy, clustered flowers in shades of pink to red, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers cool, moist climates. Rhododendron rugosum is often found in forested areas at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,500 meters."
