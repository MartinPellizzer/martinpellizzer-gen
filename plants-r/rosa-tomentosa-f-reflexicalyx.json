    "intro": "Rosa tomentosa f. reflexicalyx, commonly known as the woolly rose or the reflexed-leaf rose, is a unique cultivar of the Rosa tomentosa species. It is characterized by its dense, white to grayish pubescence covering the stems and leaves, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The leaves are typically compound, with five to seven oval leaflets that have a slightly serrated edge. The flowers are usually pink to red, with a subtle fragrance, and bloom in late spring to early summer. This variety is often grown as an ornamental plant for its attractive foliage and delicate blossoms."
