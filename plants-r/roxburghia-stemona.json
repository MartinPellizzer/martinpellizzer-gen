    "intro": "Roxburghia stemona, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and dark green, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by woody, egg-shaped fruits. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and rich reddish hue, though it is also listed as endangered due to overexploitation. The species plays an important ecological role in its native habitats, supporting various wildlife species."
