    "intro": "Rubus foliosus var. sparsipilus, commonly known as the sparse-hair raspberry, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, thornless stems and small, trifoliate leaves with a sparse covering of fine hairs. The plant produces small, red, aggregate fruits that are typically consumed by birds and other wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
