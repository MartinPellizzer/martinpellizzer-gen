    "intro": "Rhaponticum nanum, commonly known as dwarf rhapontic thistle, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows to a height of around 10\u201330 centimeters and features a dense, spiny stem covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in early summer, which are surrounded by a series of overlapping, leaf-like bracts. Its leaves are usually basal, narrow, and covered in short, stiff hairs. Rhaponticum nanum is often found in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to harsh, alpine environments."
