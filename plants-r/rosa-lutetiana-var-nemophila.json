    "intro": "Rosa lutetiana var. nemophila, commonly known as the woodland rose, is a rare and delicate species native to the temperate forests of Europe. It is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant prefers moist, well-drained soils and thrives in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Its leaves are simple, ovate, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions."
