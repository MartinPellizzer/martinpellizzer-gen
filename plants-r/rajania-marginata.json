It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, often brightly colored flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are broad and fleshy, adapted to store water in its natural habitat. The flowers bloom in clusters and are pollinated primarily by insects, contributing to its ecological significance in tropical ecosystems."
