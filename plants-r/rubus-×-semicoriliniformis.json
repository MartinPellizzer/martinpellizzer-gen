    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 semicoriliniformis, commonly known as the hybrid blackberry raspberry, is a botanical hybrid resulting from the cross between Rubus ursinus (the American blackberry) and Rubus chingii (the Chinese raspberry). This plant typically produces dark red to black berries that are smaller than those of pure blackberries but have a more intense flavor. It is a deciduous shrub with thorny stems and compound leaves, characteristic of many Rubus species. The flowers are usually white or pale pink, and the plant thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and edible fruits, though it can be challenging to cultivate due to its hybrid nature."
