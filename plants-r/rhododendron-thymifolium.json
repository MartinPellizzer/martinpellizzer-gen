    "intro": "Rhododendron thymifolium, commonly known as the thyme-leaved rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Asia, particularly in China, India, and Nepal. It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage that resembles the leaves of thyme, hence its common name. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers cool, moist climates with partial shade. Rhododendron thymifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and natural landscapes."
