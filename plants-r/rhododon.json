It is characterized by its showy, pink or red flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has slender, upright stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Rhododon is native to Europe, Asia, and North America, and it thrives in a variety of habitats, including wastelands and disturbed soils. It is often considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to colonize new areas."
