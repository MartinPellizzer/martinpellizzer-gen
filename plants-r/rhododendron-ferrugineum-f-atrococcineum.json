    "intro": "Rhododendron ferrugineum f. atrococcineum, commonly known as the purple leaved alpine rhododendron, is a rare and striking variant of the alpine rhododendron. It is characterized by its deep purple to almost black foliage, which contrasts vividly with its typical green leaves. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments, often found in mountainous regions of Europe. It produces small, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring. This form is particularly valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in specialized gardens."
