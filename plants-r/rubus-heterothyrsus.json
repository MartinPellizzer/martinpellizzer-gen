    "intro": "Rubus heterothyrsus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved blackberry, is a species of bramble native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and aggregate fruits that develop from multiple flowers. The plant typically grows in woodland edges, hedgerows, and disturbed soils, preferring moist, well-drained conditions. Its leaves are alternate, with a doubly serrated margin and a distinctive pubescent underside. The berries, which are dark purple to black when ripe, are edible and often used in jams and wines."
