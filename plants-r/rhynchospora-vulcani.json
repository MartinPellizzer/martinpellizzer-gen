It typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, often found in areas with nutrient-rich soils. The plant features slender, triangular stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are grass-like, with a smooth surface and a distinct midrib. Rhynchospora vulcani plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native environments and supports local biodiversity."
