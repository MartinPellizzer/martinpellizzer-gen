    "intro": "Rhus diversiloba, commonly known as the netleaf sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are divided into narrow, elongated leaflets that give it a feathery appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by red, fuzzy fruits that are edible for birds and some mammals. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and along dry streambanks. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to provide habitat for wildlife."
