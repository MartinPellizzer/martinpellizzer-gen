    "intro": "Raciborskanthos capricornis, commonly known as the Capricorn bellflower, is a unique flowering plant native to the subtropical regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its striking bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep purple, often with a contrasting throat. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
