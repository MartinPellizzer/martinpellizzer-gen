    "intro": "Ranunculus hicanostylus, commonly known as the Hicanostylus buttercup, is a member of the Ranunculaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central America, particularly in countries like Mexico and Guatemala. The plant features showy, yellow flowers with five to seven petals, and it has a distinctive, hairy stem. Its leaves are deeply lobed and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its high-altitude habitat. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate, spring-blooming flowers."
