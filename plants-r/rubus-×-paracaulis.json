    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 paracaulis, commonly known as the blackberry raspberry, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Rubus ursinus (blackberry) and Rubus idaeus (raspberry). It exhibits characteristics of both parent species, with thorny stems and aggregate fruits that are typically red or black when mature. The plant is a perennial shrub that thrives in temperate climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Its fruit is edible, though it is often used in jams and preserves due to its tart flavor. The botanical features of Rubus \u00d7 paracaulis make it a popular choice for cultivation in gardens and commercial agriculture."
