    "intro": "Ruschia ruralis, commonly known as the desert geranium, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a succulent shrub that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, characterized by its fleshy, water-storing stems and leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from red to pink, typically blooming in spring. Its adaptations to drought include a thick cuticle on the leaves and the ability to store water in its stems. Ruschia ruralis is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
