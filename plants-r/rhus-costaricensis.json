    "intro": "Rhus costaricensis, commonly known as the Costa Rican sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Central America. It belongs to the Anacardiaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like poison ivy and mango. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves, which are usually pinnately arranged with serrated edges. Its small, yellowish-green flowers are followed by red, fuzzy berries that mature in the fall. Rhus costaricensis is often found in dry forests and along forest edges, where it plays a role in local ecosystems."
