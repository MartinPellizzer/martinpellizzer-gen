    "intro": "Rhus spathulata, commonly known as smooth sumac, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern and central United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically trifoliate, with three leaflets that are broadly ovate to spatulate in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in panicles, followed by bright red, berry-like fruits that are clustered in pairs. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in dry, rocky soils. Smooth sumac is also notable for its use in traditional medicine and as a source of dye."
