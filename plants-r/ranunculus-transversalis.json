    "intro": "Ranunculus transversalis, commonly known as the Transverse buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features delicate, palmately lobed leaves and bright yellow flowers with five to eleven petals. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodland floors and stream banks. It is characterized by its short, stout stems and is often found in temperate climates. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
