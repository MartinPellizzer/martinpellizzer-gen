    "intro": "Rubus rubicundus f. longifolius, commonly known as the long-leaved blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its elongated, serrated leaves that are typically darker green and more robust than those of the typical species. The plant produces small, dark purple berries that are edible but less commonly cultivated than other blackberry varieties. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight. This form is often found in woodland edges and riparian areas, contributing to local biodiversity."
