    "intro": "Roegneria anthosachnoides var. scabrilemmata, commonly known as the rough-leaved wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, linear leaves with a rough, scabrous texture on the upper surface. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, two-lobed florets. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. This variety is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
