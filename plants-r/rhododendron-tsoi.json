    "intro": "Rhododendron tsoi, commonly known as the Tsoi rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia, particularly in China and Korea. It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its dense, leathery leaves and showy clusters of bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing pink to red flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Rhododendron tsoi prefers acidic, well-drained soils and thrives in partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value and adaptability to cooler climates contribute to its cultivation in horticultural settings."
