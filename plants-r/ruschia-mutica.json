    "intro": "Ruschia mutica, commonly known as the woolly ruschia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage covered in fine, soft hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or red, typically during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and low maintenance requirements make it an attractive addition to both indoor and outdoor collections."
