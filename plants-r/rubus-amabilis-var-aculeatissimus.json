    "intro": "Rubus amabilis var. aculeatissimus, commonly known as the Pacific blackberry, is a species native to the western coast of North America. It is a shrub that typically grows in moist, shady environments such as forests and streambanks. The plant features compound leaves with serrated edges and produces small, white to pink flowers in the spring. Its fruits, which are aggregate berries, are usually dark purple to black when ripe and are edible. The variety is distinguished by its particularly dense and sharp prickles, which are more pronounced than in other Rubus species."
