    "intro": "Rumicastrum corrigioloides, commonly known as the Mexican firebush, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and clusters of bright red, tubular flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its leaves are typically small, oval-shaped, and covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds."
