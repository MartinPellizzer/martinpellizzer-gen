    "intro": "Ranunculus pauperculus, commonly known as the poor man's buttercup, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features delicate, palmately lobed leaves and produces showy, yellow flowers with five to seven petals. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. It is often found in alpine meadows and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value."
