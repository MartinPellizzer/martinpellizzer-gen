    "intro": "Rumex maricola, commonly known as mountain sorrel, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, preferring well-drained soils. The plant features alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are small and clustered in loose inflorescences, producing seeds that are dispersed by wind. Rumex maricola is valued for its edible leaves, which have a tart, sour flavor similar to rhubarb."
