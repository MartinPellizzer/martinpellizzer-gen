    "intro": "Roepera humillima, commonly known as the dwarf roepera, is a small, herbaceous plant native to South America. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. The plant features delicate, trifoliate leaves and small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in the spring. Its roots are fibrous and help it anchor in rocky or clay soils. Roepera humillima is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with appropriate conditions."
