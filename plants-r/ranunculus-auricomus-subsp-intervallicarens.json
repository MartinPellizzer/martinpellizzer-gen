    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus subsp. intervallicarens, commonly known as the alpine buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky areas, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant features bright yellow flowers with five to seven petals, which are often adorned with a distinctive white or greenish border. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a hairy surface that helps reduce water loss in high-altitude environments. This subspecies is characterized by its unique flowering pattern, where flowers open in a staggered manner over several days."
