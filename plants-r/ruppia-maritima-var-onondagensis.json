    "intro": "Ruppia maritima var. onondagensis, commonly known as the Onondaga sea rocket, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments. It typically grows in brackish or saltwater habitats, such as tidal flats and estuaries. The plant has small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss in its saline environment. Its flowers are unisexual, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants. This variety is native to coastal regions of North America and plays a role in stabilizing sediment in aquatic ecosystems."
