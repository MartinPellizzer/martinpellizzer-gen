    "intro": "Rhizophora mucronata var. stylosa, commonly known as the mangrove apple or red mangrove, is a species of mangrove tree native to the Indo-Pacific region. It is characterized by its distinctive aerial roots, which provide structural support and facilitate gas exchange in waterlogged soils. The plant produces small, red, fleshy fruits that are dispersed by water and birds. Its leaves are alternate,\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. This variant is adapted to saline environments and plays a crucial role in coastal ecosystems by stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species."
