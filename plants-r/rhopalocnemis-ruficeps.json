    "intro": "Rhopalocnemis ruficeps, commonly known as the red-headed longhorn beetle, is a species of beetle belonging to the family Cerambycidae. It is characterized by its distinctive red head and elongated body, which are typical features of longhorn beetles. The plant-related aspects of this species primarily involve its role as a herbivore, feeding on the bark and wood of various trees. Its life cycle includes a larval stage that develops within the wood of host plants, contributing to the decomposition process in forest ecosystems. This beetle is often found in temperate and tropical regions where its preferred host trees are present."
