    "intro": "Rulingia densiflora, commonly known as the dense-flowered rulingia, is a shrub native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and is often found in high-altitude environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, giving it its common name. Its leaves are typically leathery and evergreen, adapted to the cool, humid conditions of its habitat. Rulingia densiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
