    "intro": "Rosa pocutica, commonly known as the Turkish rose, is a shrub native to Turkey and parts of the Balkans. It is characterized by its thorny stems and fragrant, pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or dry habitats, demonstrating a degree of drought tolerance. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, red fruits that contain seeds. Rosa pocutica is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its historical use in perfumery."
