    "intro": "Rhinorchis pickelii, commonly known as the Pickel's rhinorchis, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to specific regions in South America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pale pink. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in cloud forests at high elevations. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the surrounding soil and air, making it highly sensitive to environmental changes. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Rhinorchis pickelii is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
