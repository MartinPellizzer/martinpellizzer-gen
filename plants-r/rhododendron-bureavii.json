It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in acidic, well-drained soils and thrives in shaded to partially shaded environments. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardeners in temperate climates. However, it is important to note that it can be invasive in certain regions if not managed properly."
