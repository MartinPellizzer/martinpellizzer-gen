    "intro": "Rhododendron degronianum, commonly known as the De Gr\u00f6ningen rhododendron, is a rare and endangered species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it thrives in acidic, well-drained soils. Its ornamental value has led to increased interest in cultivation, though its conservation status remains critical due to habitat loss. Due to its rarity, it is often found in specialized botanical gardens and conservation programs."
