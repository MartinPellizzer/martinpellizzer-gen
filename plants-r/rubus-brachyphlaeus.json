    "intro": "Rubus brachyphlaeus, commonly known as the short-stemmed blackberry, is a species of bramble native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its dense, thorny growth and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that ripen to a deep black color, typically in late summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands and thickets. Due to its hardy nature, it is a common sight in many native plant gardens."
