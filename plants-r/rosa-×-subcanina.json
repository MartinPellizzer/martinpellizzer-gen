    "intro": "Rosa \u00d7 subcanina, commonly known as the evergreen shrub rose, is a hybrid species within the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, thorny growth habit and dark green, leathery foliage that remains throughout the year. The plant produces fragrant, semi-double to fully double flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, typically blooming in spring. It is well-suited for coastal gardens due to its tolerance of salt spray and mild frost. Rosa \u00d7 subcanina is also valued for its ornamental appeal and use in hedging and landscape design."
