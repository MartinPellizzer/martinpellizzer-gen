    "intro": "Romulea dichotoma, commonly known as the two-branched sandroot, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces tall, flowering stems that bear clusters of pale yellow to orange flowers with a distinctive, spurred petal. Its bulbs are adapted for survival in arid environments, allowing it to store water and nutrients. Romulea dichotoma thrives in well-drained sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland fynbos habitats."
