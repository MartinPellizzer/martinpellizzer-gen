    "intro": "Rosa mollis f. reclinatella, commonly known as the creeping shrub rose, is a compact, low-growing shrub characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine, soft hairs, giving them a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of pale pink to white flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its thorny stems and aromatic foliage make it suitable for use as a ground cover or in rock gardens. This cultivar is well-suited to moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight."
