It typically grows along riverbanks and moist soils, exhibiting a spreading habit with multiple stems. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin. Its flowers are small, greenish-yellow, and clustered in catkins, which are characteristic of the Salicaceae family. Richterago riparia is valued for its ability to stabilize stream banks and provide habitat for wildlife."
