    "intro": "Rhus ludoviciana, commonly known as the sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern and central United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and turn vibrant red in the fall. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by red, fuzzy fruit clusters that contain seeds. Rhus ludoviciana is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in woodland edges, fields, and disturbed areas. It plays an important role in supporting local wildlife, providing food and habitat for birds and insects."
