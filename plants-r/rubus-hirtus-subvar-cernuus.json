    "intro": "Rubus hirtus subvar. cernuus, commonly known as the creeping raspberry, is a shrub native to eastern North America. It features arching stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or yellow when mature. Its leaves are trifoliate, with hairy surfaces that give it a rough texture. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
