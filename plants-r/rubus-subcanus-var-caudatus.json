    "intro": "Rubus subcanus var. caudatus, commonly known as the long-stemmed blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to North America. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and thorny stems, which help it to climb and spread across various habitats. The leaves are typically trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the flowers are white with five petals. Its fruit, a dark purple to black berry, is edible and often used in jams and desserts. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and thickets."
