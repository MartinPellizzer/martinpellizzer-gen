    "intro": "Rhododendron ciliilobum, commonly known as the woolly rhododendron, is a species native to the Himalayas, particularly in regions of India, Nepal, and Bhutan. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and showy, bell-shaped flowers that typically bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forested areas at high altitudes. Its leaves are broad and leathery, with a distinctive waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. The flowers, which come in shades of pink to white, are an important nectar source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
