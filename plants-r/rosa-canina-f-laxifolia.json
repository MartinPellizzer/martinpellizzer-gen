    "intro": "Rosa canina f. laxifolia, commonly known as the laxifolia rose, is a botanical variant of the dog rose. It is characterized by its slender, arching stems and smaller, more delicate flowers compared to the typical Rosa canina. The plant produces yellowish-orange hips, which are rich in vitamin C and used in traditional medicine. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges or hedgerows. Its foliage is typically dark green with finely serrated leaves, contributing to its ornamental value."
