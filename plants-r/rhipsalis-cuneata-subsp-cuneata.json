    "intro": "Rhipsalis cuneata subsp. cuneata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed rhipsalis, is a species of epiphytic cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems covered in small, soft spines. The plant produces delicate, white or pale pink flowers that bloom during the rainy season. Its leaves are narrow and often shed after flowering, which is a common trait in many rhipsalis species. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often cultivated as a decorative plant in greenhouses or terrariums."
