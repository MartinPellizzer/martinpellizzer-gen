    "intro": "Richetia laxa, commonly known as the narrowleaf richetia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes plants like carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a slightly hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in its native habitat."
