    "intro": "Ranunculus pankakoskii, commonly known as the Pankakoskii crowfoot, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, palmately divided leaves and showy, yellow flowers with a distinctive black center. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. It is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal. Due to its restricted distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species in its native range."
