    "intro": "Rubus ramifer, commonly known as the creeping raspberry, is a shrub native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, red or yellow berries. The plant has compound leaves with serrated edges and produces fragrant white flowers in the spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The berries are edible but can be quite tart, making them suitable for jams and preserves."
