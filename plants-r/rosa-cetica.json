It is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. The plant has woody stems and produces small, rounded leaves with a slightly serrated edge. Rosa cetica thrives in saline and sandy soils, making it well adapted to coastal environments. It is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and resilience to harsh maritime conditions."
