    "intro": "Rosa pendulina f. ovoidea, commonly known as the oval-fruited climbing rose, is a unique cultivar characterized by its pendulous growth habit and distinctive fruit morphology. The plant features long, arching stems that are often trained against supports, making it ideal for vertical gardening. Its flowers are typically pink to red, with a rich fragrance, and they bloom in late spring to early summer. The fruits, or hips, are notably oval in shape, differing from the more rounded hips of the species Rosa pendulina. This form is prized in horticulture for its ornamental value and adaptability to various climates."
