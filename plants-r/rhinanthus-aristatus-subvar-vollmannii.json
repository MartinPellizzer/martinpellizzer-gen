    "intro": "Rhinanthus aristatus subvar. vollmannii, commonly known as the yellow rattle, is a flowering plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is typically found in grasslands and meadows, where it plays a role in promoting plant diversity by reducing the dominance of grasses. Its nectar-rich flowers attract a variety of pollinators, including bees and butterflies."
