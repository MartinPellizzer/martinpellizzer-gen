    "intro": "Rhodostachys leiboldiana, commonly known as the yellow lichen orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique yellowish-green inflorescence and small, intricate flowers. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or rocks in high-altitude areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires careful conservation efforts. Its botanical significance lies in its role as an indicator species for cloud forest ecosystems."
