    "intro": "Racinaea grantii, commonly known as the Grant's racinaea, is a rare and striking member of the Araceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Central America, particularly found in the humid lowland forests of Nicaragua and Costa Rica. The plant is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 3 feet in diameter, with a deep green color and prominent veins. Its inflorescence consists of a spadix surrounded by a colorful spathe, which adds to its ornamental appeal. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Racinaea grantii is considered a threatened species, making it a valuable subject for botanical study and conservation efforts."
