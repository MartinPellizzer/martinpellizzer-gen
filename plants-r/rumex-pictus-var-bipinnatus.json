    "intro": "Rumex pictus var. bipinnatus, commonly known as the bi-pinnate sorrel, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of Asia. It features attractive, doubly pinnate leaves that are often bright green with a reddish tinge, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along streambanks. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
