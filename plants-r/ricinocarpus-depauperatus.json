    "intro": "Ricinocarpus depauperatus, commonly known as the slender sea palm, is a unique marine plant found in shallow coastal waters. It belongs to the family Zosteraceae and is characterized by its delicate, ribbon-like leaves that are often submerged or partially exposed. The plant lacks true roots and instead relies on rhizoids for anchorage and nutrient absorption. Its structure is adapted to withstand turbulent aquatic conditions, and it plays a role in stabilizing coastal sediments. Despite its simple appearance, it is an important component of intertidal ecosystems."
