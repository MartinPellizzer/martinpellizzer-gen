    "intro": "Rosa canina f. subcuneata, commonly known as the narrow-angled dog rose, is a botanical variant of the common dog rose. It is characterized by its narrow, acute leaflets and smaller, more delicate flowers compared to the typical form. The plant produces bright red, single or semi-double flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its hips, like those of the common dog rose, are edible and contain high levels of vitamin C. This subspecies is often found in woodland edges and open habitats across Europe."
