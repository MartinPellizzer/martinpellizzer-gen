    "intro": "Rubus serpens var. lencanus, commonly known as the Mexican blackberry, is a species of brambles native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and thorny stems, which help it to climb and spread across vegetation. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically harvested when fully ripe. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the flowers are white with five petals. This variant is closely related to other Rubus species and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks."
