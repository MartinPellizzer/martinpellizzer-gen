    "intro": "Ribes rotundifolium var. villosum, commonly known as the woolly gooseberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its rounded, lobed leaves that are densely covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are followed by edible, red berries in late summer. Its growth habit is typically compact, with multiple stems arising from the base. The woolly gooseberry is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks."
