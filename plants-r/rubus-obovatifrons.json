    "intro": "Rubus obovatifrons, commonly known as the broad-fruited blackberry, is a species of bramble native to western North America. It is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit, with thorny stems and compound leaves that are typically oval in shape. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that develop from the fusion of multiple drupelets, which are often dark purple to black in color. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, loamy soils in full sun to partial shade. The botanical features of Rubus obovatifrons make it an important species in both ecological and horticultural contexts."
