    "intro": "Robinia mollissima, commonly known as the silky acacia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and covered in a soft, silvery down that gives it its common name. The plant produces fragrant, yellow, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it adaptable to various environmental conditions. Its ornamental value and ability to fix nitrogen make it both ecologically and horticulturally significant."
