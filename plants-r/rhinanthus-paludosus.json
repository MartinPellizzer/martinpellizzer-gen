    "intro": "Rhinanthus paludosus, commonly known as the marsh woundwort, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in Europe. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, which includes many parasitic and hemiparasitic species. The plant typically grows in damp, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in marshes, fens, and along the edges of water bodies. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Rhinanthus paludosus plays an important ecological role by supporting pollinators and contributing to the biodiversity of wetland ecosystems."
