    "intro": "Rosa pendulina f. fraxinifolia, commonly known as the goldenbark rose, is a unique hybrid rose with distinctive botanical features. It is characterized by its elongated, pendulous growth habit and golden-yellow bark that peels in thin, papery layers. The leaves are compound, with elongated, lance-shaped leaflets that give the plant a delicate, fern-like appearance. Its flowers are typically pink to red, with a fragrant scent, and bloom in late spring to early summer. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is well-suited to warm, sunny climates."
