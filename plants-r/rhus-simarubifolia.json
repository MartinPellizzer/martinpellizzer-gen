    "intro": "Rhus simarubifolia, commonly known as the smooth sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically pinnately arranged with 11 to 31 leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in panicles, which are followed by red, fuzzy berries that attract birds and other wildlife. Rhus simarubifolia thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in suitable climates."
