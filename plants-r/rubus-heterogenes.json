    "intro": "Rubus heterogenes, commonly known as the alpine blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and produces small, dark berries that are often used in local cuisines. The plant has compound leaves with serrated edges and produces white to pale yellow flowers in early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitats."
