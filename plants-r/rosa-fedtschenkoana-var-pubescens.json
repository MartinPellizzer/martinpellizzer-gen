    "intro": "Rosa fedtschenkoana var. pubescens, commonly known as the Ussuri rose, is a rare and endangered species native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its dense, pubescent foliage and clusters of fragrant, pale pink to white flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or forested areas, and prefers cool, moist conditions. Its botanical features include thorny stems, compound leaves, and a long flowering period that extends into early summer. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
