    "intro": "Rotala andamanensis, commonly known as the Andaman waterwheel, is a semi-aquatic plant native to the Andaman Islands. It features whorled leaves that are typically bright green, with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, often floating on the water's surface. It thrives in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Rotala andamanensis is often cultivated in aquariums and ponds for its ornamental value and ability to oxygenate water."
