    "intro": "Rubus lejeunei var. dissociatus, commonly known as the dissociated blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry species native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, dark berries that are typically less tart than those of other Rubus species. The plant has compound leaves with three to five leaflets, and its stems are often thorny. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and somewhat obscure member of the Rubus genus."
