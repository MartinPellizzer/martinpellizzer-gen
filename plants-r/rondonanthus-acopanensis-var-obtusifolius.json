    "intro": "Rondonanthus acopanensis var. obtusifolius, commonly known as the Acop\u00e1n starfruit, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the tropical regions of Mexico. It belongs to the family Meliaceae, which includes various trees and shrubs known for their medicinal properties. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and distinctive, star-shaped fruits that resemble those of the common starfruit. Its leaves are typically broad and rounded, with a smooth texture and a glossy surface. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native environment."
