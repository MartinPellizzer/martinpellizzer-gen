    "intro": "Rubus leuciscanus, commonly known as the white-stemmed blackberry, is a species of bramble native to parts of eastern North America. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces aggregate fruits, typically red or black berries, which are edible but have a tart flavor. It thrives in moist, wooded areas and is often found in the understory of forests. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and declining species in its native range."
