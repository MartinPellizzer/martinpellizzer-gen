    "intro": "Rubus fuscoater subsp. absconditus, commonly known as the blackberry subsp. hidden or concealed, is a lesser-known variant of the Rubus genus. It is characterized by its dark, almost black fruits, which are typically smaller than those of its more common relatives. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in woodlands or underbrush. Its leaves are typically trifoliate, with a rough, serrated edge. While not widely cultivated, it plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing food for various wildlife species."
