    "intro": "Rubus abbreviatus, commonly known as the short-stemmed blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, thorny stems and small, dark purple berries that ripen in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, wooded areas and thrives in partial shade. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and its flowers are white with five petals. The berries are edible, though often tart, and are used in local foraging and culinary practices."
