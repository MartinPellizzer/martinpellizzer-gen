    "intro": "Rhamnus martini, commonly known as the Canary Island buckthorn, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the family Rutaceae and is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and small, elliptical leaves. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by small, dark berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in coastal and rocky habitats, often forming dense thickets in its native range. Due to its hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in warmer climates."
