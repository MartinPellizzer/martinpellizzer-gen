    "intro": "Ranunculus franconicus, commonly known as the Franconian buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to Central Europe. It features a basal rosette of finely divided, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of soft, silky hairs. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with five to seven petals, typically blooming from May to July. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and protected species in many regions."
