    "intro": "Rosa uriensis var. heteracantha, commonly known as the Rocky Mountain rose, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and thorny stems, with dark green, ovate leaves that have a slightly serrated edge. The plant produces fragrant, pink to red flowers in late spring to early summer, which are borne on long pedicels. Its botanical features include compound leaves with three to five leaflets and a deep root system that helps it thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in mountainous environments."
