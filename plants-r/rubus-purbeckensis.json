    "intro": "Rubus purbeckensis, commonly known as the Purbeck bramble, is a species of flowering plant in the rose family, Rubiaceae. It is native to the British Isles, particularly found in the Purbeck area of Dorset, England. The plant is characterized by its thorny stems, trifoliate leaves, and small, aggregate fruits that develop from its flowers. It thrives in woodland and hedgerow environments, often in acidic soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected species in the UK."
