    "intro": "Rumex acmophorus, commonly known as the narrowleaf dock, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant has alternate, lanceolate leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, greenish flowers in clusters. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense stands. The species is valued for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally in herbal remedies."
