    "intro": "Rhododendron eudoxum subsp. mesopolium, commonly known as the Himalayan rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Asia, particularly in Nepal and India. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically thrives in cool, humid climates and is often found in forested areas at high elevations. Its leaves are evergreen, leathery, and dark green, providing a striking contrast to its vibrant floral display. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with appropriate care."
