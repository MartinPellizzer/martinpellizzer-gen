    "intro": "Rosa canina f. pontiacensis, commonly known as the Pontiac rose, is a rare and distinctive form of the dog rose. It is characterized by its pale yellow to orange flowers, which are often more showy than those of the typical Rosa canina. The plant is native to the northeastern United States, particularly in areas of New England and New York. It typically grows in open woods and along stream banks, preferring well-drained soils. Its botanical features include thorny stems, pinnate leaves, and hips that are smaller and more conical than those of the common dog rose."
