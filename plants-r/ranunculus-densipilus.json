    "intro": "Ranunculus densipilus, commonly known as the dense-hairy buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features upright, hairy stems that bear trifoliate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with numerous petals and a central cluster of stamens. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in some regions."
