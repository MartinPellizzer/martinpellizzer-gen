    "intro": "Ritchiea chlorantha, commonly known as the green-leafed cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the tropical rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that are typically bright green. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. Ritchiea chlorantha is listed as endangered due to habitat loss and over-collection, making it a conservation priority. Its unique morphology and ecological role highlight its importance in the biodiversity of its native environment."
