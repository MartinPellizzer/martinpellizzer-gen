    "intro": "Rumicastrum pumilum, commonly known as the dwarf thornbush, is a low-growing shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It features small, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for some wildlife. Its thorny stems provide protection against herbivores, and its root system is adapted to efficiently absorb moisture from the soil. Rumicastrum pumilum plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and supporting local biodiversity."
