    "intro": "Rumex sanguineus var. viridis, commonly known as the green dock, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features broad, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a waxy coating, and it produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in the summer. The plant thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks. It has a robust root system that allows it to spread vegetatively and is sometimes considered invasive in certain regions. Its botanical characteristics make it an important species in ecological studies and wetland restoration projects."
