    "intro": "Roldana donnell-smithii, commonly known as the Donnell-Smith's roldana, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Ecuador. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats within cloud forests, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are small and yellowish, arranged in dense clusters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Roldana donnell-smithii is considered a vulnerable species."
