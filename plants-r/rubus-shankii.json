    "intro": "Rubus shankii, commonly known as the Shanks' blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically harvested in late summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
