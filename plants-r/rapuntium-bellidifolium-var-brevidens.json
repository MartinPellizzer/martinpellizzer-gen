    "intro": "Rapuntium bellidifolium var. brevidens, commonly known as the short-leaved bellidifolium, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and segmented seed pods. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its leaves are lanceolate and densely packed, forming a basal rosette, while its flowers are usually pale yellow or white. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
