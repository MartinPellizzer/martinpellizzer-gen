    "intro": "Rhynchospora puncticulata, commonly known as the punctuated flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, clustered inflorescences that produce tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often in marshes and swamps. Its root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion in these habitats. Rhynchospora puncticulata plays an important ecological role in supporting aquatic and wetland biodiversity."
