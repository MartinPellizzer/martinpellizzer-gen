    "intro": "Rubus albicans, commonly known as the white-bracted raspberry, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its biennial growth habit, with the first year producing vegetative growth and the second year bearing flowers and fruits. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits called drupes, which are typically white or pale yellow in color. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species in certain regions."
