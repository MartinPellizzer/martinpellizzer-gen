It is characterized by its slender, branching stems that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom during the rainy season, followed by small, red berries. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks. Due to its unique appearance and growth habit, it is a popular choice for indoor cultivation."
