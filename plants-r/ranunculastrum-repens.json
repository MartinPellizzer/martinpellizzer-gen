    "intro": "Ranunculastrum repens, commonly known as the creeping buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features a low-growing, sprawling habit with hairy stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread aggressively. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in early spring. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a distinctive lobed structure, and it thrives in moist, disturbed soils. Ranunculastrum repens is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks."
