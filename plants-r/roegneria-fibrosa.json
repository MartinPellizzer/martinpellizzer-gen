    "intro": "Roegneria fibrosa, commonly known as slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of Asia and North America. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are arranged in a loose panicle, producing small, wind-pollinated flowers. Roegneria fibrosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping or as a forage plant for livestock."
