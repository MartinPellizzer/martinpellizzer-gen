    "intro": "Rumex longisetus, commonly known as the long-hair dock, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in dense, long hairs, giving it its common name. The plant produces tall, slender flowering stems that bear clusters of small, greenish flowers. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. Rumex longisetus is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used historically in traditional medicine."
