    "intro": "Rusbya pearcei, commonly known as the Cape York pearsonia, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of northern Australia. It typically grows in coastal and sandy soils, often in areas with high humidity and salt spray. The plant features narrow, leathery leaves that are arranged in a spiral pattern along its stems. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by red, fleshy berries. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Rusbya pearcei is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
