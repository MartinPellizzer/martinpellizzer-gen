    "intro": "Rauvolfia canescens var. typica, commonly known as Indian snakeroot, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Pacific Islands. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its woody stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by capsule fruits containing elliptical seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its medicinal properties, it has been historically used in traditional medicine for its hypotensive effects."
