It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces aggregate fruits, known as blackberries, which are dark purple to black when ripe. These fruits are borne on the ends of the stems and are typically harvested in the summer. The plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils."
