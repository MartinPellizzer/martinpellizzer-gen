    "intro": "Rotheca aurantiaca f. faulkneri, commonly known as the Falkner's orange rotheca, is a rare and striking plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and showy inflorescences. The plant is distinguished by its vivid orange to reddish-orange flowers, which bloom in late summer to early autumn. Its foliage consists of narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. Due to its limited distribution and unique appearance, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
