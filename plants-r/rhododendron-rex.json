    "intro": "Rhododendron rex, commonly known as the \"King of the Rhododendrons,\" is a striking evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage that ranges from deep green to almost black in color. The plant produces showy, clustered flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Rhododendron rex thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and requires partial to full shade for optimal growth. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for garden landscapes and rockeries."
