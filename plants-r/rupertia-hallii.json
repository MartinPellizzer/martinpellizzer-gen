    "intro": "Rupertia hallii, commonly known as the Sierra violet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky habitats, such as cliffs and slopes, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance. Rupertia hallii is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
