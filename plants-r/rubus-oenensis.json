    "intro": "Rubus oenensis, commonly known as the Spanish blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, dark purple to black fruits. The plant produces aggregate fruits composed of tiny drupelets, which are typically harvested when fully ripe. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
