    "intro": "Rouhamon brevifolium, commonly known as the short-leaved rouhamon, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a dense rosette. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink, which bloom during the late spring and early summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil. Due to habitat loss, Rouhamon brevifolium is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs."
