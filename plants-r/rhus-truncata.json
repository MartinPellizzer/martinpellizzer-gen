    "intro": "Rhus truncata, commonly known as staghorn sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern and central United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and turn bright red in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in panicles, followed by red, fleshy fruits that are edible for birds and some mammals. Its bark is thick and rough, with a distinctive, rugged texture that gives it its common name. Rhus truncata is often found in dry, open woodlands and thrives in full sun to partial shade."
