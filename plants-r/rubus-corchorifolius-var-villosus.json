    "intro": "Rubus corchorifolius var. villosus, commonly known as the hairy bramble, is a variant of the bramble family with distinctive botanical features. It is a shrub characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves, which are often covered in a dense layer of fine, soft hairs. The leaves are typically trifoliate, meaning they consist of three leaflets, and are arranged alternately along the stem. Its flowers are small, white or pink, and clustered in dense inflorescences, while the fruit is a red, aggregate berry. This plant is native to parts of Asia and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed areas."
