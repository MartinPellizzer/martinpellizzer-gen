    "intro": "Rubus carneus, commonly known as the pink raspberry, is a species of bramble native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its biennial growth habit, with the first year producing leaves and the second year bearing flowers and fruit. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically pink to red in color, which are edible but often tart. Its leaves are palmately compound, with serrated edges, and the stems are covered in fine, hooked hairs. Rubus carneus thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or hedgerows."
