    "intro": "Rubus genevieri var. vestitus, commonly known as the hairy bramble, is a variant of the bramble genus Rubus. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and thorny stems, typical of many Rubus species. The plant is native to parts of Europe and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils. Its flowers are small and white, with five petals, and it produces edible berries that are similar to other Rubus species. The hairy vestiture on its leaves and stems is a distinguishing feature of this particular variety."
