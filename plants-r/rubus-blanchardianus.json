    "intro": "Rubus blanchardianus, commonly known as the Blanchard's blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the Andes Mountains in South America. It is characterized by its thorny stems and aggregate fruits composed of small, dark red to black drupelets. The plant produces fragrant white flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by the development of its edible berries. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and somewhat obscure member of the Rubus genus."
