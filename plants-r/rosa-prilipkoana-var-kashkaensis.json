    "intro": "Rosa prilipkoana var. kashkaensis, commonly known as the Kashka Mountain rose, is a rare and ornamental shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and clusters of fragrant, pink to red flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces small, oval-shaped leaves with serrated edges, typical of many rose species. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a hardy ornamental in temperate climates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable but endangered species in its native range."
