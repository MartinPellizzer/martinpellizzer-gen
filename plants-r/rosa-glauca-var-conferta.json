    "intro": "Rosa glauca var. conferta, commonly known as the dense blue rose, is a compact shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with dense clusters of small, pale blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring. The foliage is typically gray-green, with hairy leaves that provide a distinctive appearance. This variety is well-suited for rock gardens and borders due to its hardy nature and ornamental value. It requires well-drained soil and full sun to thrive."
