    "intro": "Rubus littoralis, commonly known as the coastal blackberry, is a perennial shrub native to coastal regions of North America. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines and is adapted to salt spray and wind exposure. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are edible but often have a tart flavor. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and its stems are covered in stiff, prickly hairs. This species plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
