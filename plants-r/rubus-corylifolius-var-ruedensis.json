    "intro": "Rubus corylifolius var. ruedensis, commonly known as the Ruedensian raspberry, is a variant of the raspberry plant native to certain regions of Central Europe. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically trifoliate or pinnate, with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are usually red when mature, similar to other Rubus species. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland or shaded areas. This variant is valued for both its ornamental qualities and potential culinary uses."
