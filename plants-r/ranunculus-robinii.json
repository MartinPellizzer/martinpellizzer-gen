    "intro": "Ranunculus robinii, commonly known as the sandstone buttercup, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its delicate, yellow flowers with five petals and a hairy, upright stem. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are palmately lobed and covered in fine, silky hairs. Ranunculus robinii is a short-lived perennial that blooms in early spring, contributing to the ecological diversity of its native habitat."
