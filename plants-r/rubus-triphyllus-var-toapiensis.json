    "intro": "Rubus triphyllus var. toapiensis, commonly known as the Toapi blackberry, is a shrub native to the high-altitude regions of South America, particularly in Ecuador. It is characterized by its thorny stems and trifoliate leaves, which are typically small and elliptical in shape. The plant produces aggregate fruits composed of small, dark purple to black berries, which are often used in local traditional medicine. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to rocky or forested habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
