It typically grows to a height of about 30\u201360 cm, featuring a basal rosette of silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow composite flowers in late summer, which are surrounded by bracts that give it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable plant for ecological studies and traditional herbal use."
