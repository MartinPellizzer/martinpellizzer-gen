    "intro": "Rubus micans var. saltuiformis, commonly known as the silverleaf bramble, is a shrub native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its finely hairy, dark green leaves that often have a silvery underside, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers in clusters, which are followed by red, edible berries. It thrives in woodland edges and disturbed soils, preferring partial shade to full sun. Its thorny stems and aromatic foliage make it a distinctive and ecologically important species in its native habitat."
