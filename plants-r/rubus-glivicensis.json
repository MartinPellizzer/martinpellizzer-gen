    "intro": "Rubus glivicensis, commonly known as the Moldovan blackberry, is a species of bramble native to eastern Europe. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically harvested in late summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
