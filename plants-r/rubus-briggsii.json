    "intro": "Rubus briggsii, commonly known as the briggs' blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the western United States. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves, typical of the Rubus genus. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black when mature. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
