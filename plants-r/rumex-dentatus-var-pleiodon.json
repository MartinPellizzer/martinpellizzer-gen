    "intro": "Rumex dentatus var. pleiodon, commonly known as the broad-leaved dock, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features prominently veined, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered with a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a common weed in disturbed soils. The leaves are often used in traditional medicine and as a vegetable in some cuisines."
