    "intro": "Ranunculus pinardii, commonly known as the Pinard's buttercup, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its showy, yellow petals and finely divided leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils. It produces small, green fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
