    "intro": "Rosa chlorina, commonly known as the evergreen musk rose, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, thornless stems and dark green, leathery leaves that remain on the plant year-round. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves and flowers are often used in traditional medicine for their aromatic properties. Rosa chlorina is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
