It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits known as drupes, which are typically red or black in color. It thrives in woodland edges and disturbed soils, often forming dense thickets. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas."
