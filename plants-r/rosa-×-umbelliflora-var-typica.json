    "intro": "Rosa \u00d7 umbelliflora var. typica, commonly known as the sweet briar rose, is a hybrid shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, thorny growth and clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has compound leaves with five to seven oval leaflets, and its stems are typically covered in fine, velvety hairs. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for ornamental and hedging purposes. The rose is also valued for its historical use in hedgerows and as a source of cut flowers."
