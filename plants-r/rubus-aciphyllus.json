It is characterized by its thorny stems and small, dark red to black berries that ripen in late summer. The plant produces compound leaves with a narrow, leathery texture, and its flowers are typically white or pale pink. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The fruit is edible but has a tart flavor and is sometimes used in local cuisines."
