    "intro": "Ribes \u00d7 arcuatum, commonly known as the hybrid currant, is a deciduous shrub native to North America. It is a cross between Ribes aureum (golden currant) and Ribes hirtellum (tartarian gooseberry), resulting in a plant with unique botanical characteristics. The shrub typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters and features alternate, ovate leaves with serrated edges. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, clustered in racemes, and the fruit is a small, edible berry that ripens in late summer. This hybrid is valued for its ornamental value and culinary uses in horticulture."
