    "intro": "Rhodanthe spicata, commonly known as the coastal rattlebox, is a flowering plant native to southern Australia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in coastal dunes and sandy soils. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers that are clustered in spikes, giving it its common name. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it is well adapted to salty and wind-prone environments. Rhodanthe spicata is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
