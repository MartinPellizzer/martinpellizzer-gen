    "intro": "Rhinanthus bicolor, commonly known as the common yellowtop, is a flowering plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, which includes many parasitic and semi-parasitic species. The plant is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. It grows in open habitats such as grasslands, heaths, and woodland edges, often in nutrient-poor soils. Rhinanthus bicolor is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from the roots of other plants while still performing photosynthesis."
