    "intro": "Romulea uliginosa var. maritima, commonly known as the coastal romulea, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It produces striking, showy flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, arranged in a dense, umbel-like cluster. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to saline and well-drained environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often covered in a fine layer of white wax. This variety is notable for its resilience to coastal conditions and is often found in dune ecosystems."
