    "intro": "Rosa borealis, commonly known as the Arctic rose, is a species of flowering plant native to the Arctic regions of North America and Eurasia. It is a low-growing shrub that typically reaches heights of less than 30 centimeters, with woody stems and dense foliage. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and red, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and covered in a fine layer of white hairs that help reduce water loss in cold climates. Rosa borealis is adapted to harsh environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a resilient component of Arctic ecosystems."
