It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves, which are typically trifoliate or pinnately divided. The plant produces aggregate fruits, known as drupes, which are edible and highly valued for their flavor. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in hedgerows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils. Due to its vigorous growth, it can become invasive in certain regions."
