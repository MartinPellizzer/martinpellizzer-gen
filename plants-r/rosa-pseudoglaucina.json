    "intro": "Rosa pseudoglaucina, commonly known as the Sierra Valley rose, is a species of flowering plant native to California and Nevada. It is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit and produces clusters of fragrant, pink to reddish-pink flowers. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are compound, with ovate to lanceolate leaflets, and its stems are covered in fine, pale hairs. Rosa pseudoglaucina is valued for its ornamental qualities and is also of interest in ecological studies due to its limited distribution."
