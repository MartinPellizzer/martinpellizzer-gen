    "intro": "Rinorea semigyrata, commonly known as the spiral vine, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive spiral growth pattern, where the stems twist around supporting structures in a helical manner. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale blue, arranged in clusters. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a rough texture. Rinorea semigyrata is valued in horticulture for its unique appearance and ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments."
