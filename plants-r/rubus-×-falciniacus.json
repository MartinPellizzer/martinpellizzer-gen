It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves, typical of many bramble species. The plant produces aggregate fruits, commonly referred to as berries, which are typically dark purple to black in color. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils. Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits a range of morphological variations, making it a subject of interest in botanical studies."
