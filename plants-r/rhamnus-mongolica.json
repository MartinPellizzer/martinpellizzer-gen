    "intro": "Rhamnus mongolica, commonly known as the Mongolian buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually oval to elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by small, red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in steppe and forest-steppe ecosystems. Rhamnus mongolica is also valued for its hardy nature and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
