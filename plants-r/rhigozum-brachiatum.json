    "intro": "Rhigozum brachiatum, commonly known as the narrowleaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in the southern United States. It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in length, and it produces small, white or pale green berries. The plant relies on its host for water and some nutrients, while it photosynthesizes to some extent on its own. Its seeds are dispersed by birds, which consume the berries and later excrete the seeds onto new host trees."
