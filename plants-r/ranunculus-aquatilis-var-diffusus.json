    "intro": "Ranunculus aquatilis var. diffusus, commonly known as the water crowfoot, is a aquatic or semi-aquatic plant characterized by its delicate, floating or submerged leaves. It typically features bright yellow flowers with numerous stamens, which bloom from spring to early summer. The plant thrives in freshwater environments such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. Its leaves are usually divided into fine, thread-like segments, and it often forms dense mats on the water surface. Ranunculus aquatilis var. diffusus plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
