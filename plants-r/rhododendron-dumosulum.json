    "intro": "Rhododendron dumosulum, commonly known as the dwarf rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is a compact shrub characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and showy, tubular flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, preferring acidic, well-drained soils. Its floral structure is adapted for pollination by specific insect species, and it plays a role in the local ecosystem by providing nectar and habitat. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it remains relatively rare in horticultural trade."
