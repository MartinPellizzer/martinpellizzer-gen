    "intro": "Ranunculus acaulis, commonly known as the cushion buttercup, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit, forming a cushion-like structure that helps it survive in harsh alpine conditions. The plant produces showy, cup-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, white, and red, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually divided into lobes and covered in a fine layer of silky hairs, which aid in reducing water loss. Ranunculus acaulis is often found in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons."
