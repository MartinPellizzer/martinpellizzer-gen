    "intro": "Rhododendron album var. splendidum, commonly known as the White Rhododendron, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in acidic, well-drained soil and thrives in shaded to partially shaded environments. Its leaves are elliptical, leathery, and dark green, providing a striking contrast to the white blooms. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and botanical gardens."
