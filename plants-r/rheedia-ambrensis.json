It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking yellow-orange blooms. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and surrounding substrate. Rheedia ambrensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological balance of its native habitat."
