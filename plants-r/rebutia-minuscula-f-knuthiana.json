    "intro": "Rebutia minuscula f. knuthiana, commonly known as the Knuth's miniature rebutia, is a compact, low-growing cactus native to southern Africa. It features small, cylindrical stems that are typically green or blue-green in color, adorned with white or pale yellow flowers during the summer months. The plant is highly succulent, adapted to arid environments with minimal rainfall. Its stems are often covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and ease of cultivation in well-drained soil."
