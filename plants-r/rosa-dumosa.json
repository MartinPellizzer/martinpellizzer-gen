    "intro": "Rosa dumosa, commonly known as the prickly rose, is a species of flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, fragrant pink or white flowers. The plant produces rose hips, which are the fruit containing the seeds. Rosa dumosa thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils. Its botanical features make it well adapted to drought conditions and harsh climates."
