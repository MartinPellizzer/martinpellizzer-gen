    "intro": "Rumex fennicus, commonly known as the northern dock, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to northern Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils along riverbanks, wet meadows, and other damp habitats. The plant has large, heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture and prominent veins, and it produces small, greenish flowers in clusters during the summer months. Its roots are rhizomatous, allowing it to spread vegetatively and form dense colonies. The species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
