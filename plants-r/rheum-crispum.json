    "intro": "Rheum crispum, commonly known as the rhubarb plant, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stalks and large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces tall, sparsely branched flowering stems that bear small, yellowish-green flowers. Rheum crispum is known for its edible stalks, which are used in cooking, though the leaves contain toxic compounds and should not be consumed. It thrives in cool climates and is often cultivated in gardens for both ornamental and culinary purposes."
