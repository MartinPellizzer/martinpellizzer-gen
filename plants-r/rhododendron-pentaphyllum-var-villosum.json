    "intro": "Rhododendron pentaphyllum var. villosum, commonly known as the silky-leaved rhododendron, is a compact evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage that gives it a soft, velvety appearance. The plant produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to red, typically blooming in late spring. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to form thickets, providing both visual interest and habitat for wildlife."
