    "intro": "Rhodamnia cinerea var. macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaf ghost gum, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to northern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale grey bark that peels away to reveal a lighter underlayer. The leaves are ovate to elliptical, with a glossy upper surface and a pale, often hairy underside. It produces small, pale green flowers in clusters, which are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. This species is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient and drought-tolerant plant."
