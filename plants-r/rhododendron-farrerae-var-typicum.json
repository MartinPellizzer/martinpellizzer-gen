    "intro": "Rhododendron farrerae var. typicum, commonly known as the Sierra Leone rhododendron, is a rare and endemic species native to the tropical rainforests of Sierra Leone. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to deep red. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 10 meters in its natural habitat. Its flowers bloom during the wet season, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts."
