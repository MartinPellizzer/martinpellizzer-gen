    "intro": "Rhynchospora corymbosa var. minor, commonly known as the small-corymbous bog sedge, is a perennial herb native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in acidic, nutrient-poor soils, often found in bogs, fens, and other moist environments. The plant features slender, grass-like stems with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of small, three-lobed flowers, which are usually pale green to reddish in color. This variety is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize wetland soils."
