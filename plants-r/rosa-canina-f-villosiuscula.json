    "intro": "Rosa canina f. villosiuscula, commonly known as the hairy rose or bristly dog rose, is a botanical variant of the dog rose. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which distinguish it from the typical Rosa canina. The plant produces small, pale pink flowers that bloom in spring. Its fruits are red, hairy berries that mature in late summer. This subspecies is often found in woodland edges and scrublands across Europe."
