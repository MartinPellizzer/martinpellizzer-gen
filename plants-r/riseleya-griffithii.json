It is characterized by its striking violet to purple flowers and is typically found in rocky or alpine environments. The plant has a pseudobulb structure that stores water and nutrients, aiding its survival in harsh climates. Its flowering period occurs during the warmer months, usually between June and August. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
