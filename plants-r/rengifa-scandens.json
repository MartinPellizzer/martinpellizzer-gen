    "intro": "Rengifa scandens, commonly known as the climbing rengifa, is a tropical vine native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its long, trailing stems that can climb using adventitious roots. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers clustered in umbels, followed by small, elliptical berries that turn red when mature. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Rengifa scandens is often found in humid, shaded environments such as rainforests and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
