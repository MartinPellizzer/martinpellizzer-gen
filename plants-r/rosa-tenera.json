    "intro": "Rosa tenera, commonly known as the soft rose, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of South America, particularly in countries like Chile and Argentina. The plant is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to deep pink. Its leaves are usually simple and alternate, with a hairy texture that helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. Rosa tenera is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its beauty and fragrance."
