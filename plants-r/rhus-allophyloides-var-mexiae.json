    "intro": "Rhus allophyloides var. mexiae, commonly known as the Mexican buckthorn, is a shrub native to central Mexico. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often pubescent on the underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in catkins, followed by small, red berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. This variant is distinguished by its unique leaf morphology and geographic distribution compared to other Rhus species."
