    "intro": "Rubus fuscus var. papyraceus, commonly known as the paper raspberry, is a perennial shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender stems and small, elliptical leaves with a distinctive waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of white to pale pink flowers in the spring, followed by red, hairy berries that ripen in the summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its fibrous leaves and stems have historically been used for papermaking, giving it its common name."
