    "intro": "Ranunculus pallasii var. spetsbergensis, commonly known as the Spetsbergensis buttercup, is a rare and distinctive flowering plant native to the Arctic regions of Russia. It is characterized by its delicate, yellowish-orange flowers with five petals and a hairy, glandular stem. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky habitats and is adapted to the harsh, cold environments of its native range. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it blooms during the short summer season. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
