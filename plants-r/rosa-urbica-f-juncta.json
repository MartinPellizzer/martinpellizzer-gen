It is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often found in urban environments. The plant typically has pale pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are serrated and have a slightly hairy texture, typical of many rose species. This form is well adapted to thrive in disturbed soils and can be a resilient addition to urban landscaping."
