    "intro": "Ramium calophlebum, commonly known as the African marsh grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and along riverbanks, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant has slender, erect stems that bear small, linear leaves arranged alternately along the stem. Its flowering spikes produce tiny, white or pale green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Ramium calophlebum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
