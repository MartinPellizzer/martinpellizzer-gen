    "intro": "Rubus nocivus, commonly known as the poison ivy vine, is a member of the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. It produces bright red berries that are toxic to humans and animals, containing urushiol, a potent allergen. The plant is typically found in moist, shaded areas and can grow as a climbing vine or shrub. Its leaves are usually three-lobed, with a rough texture and a distinctive scent when crushed. Despite its harmful properties, it plays a role in certain ecosystems by providing food for specific wildlife species."
