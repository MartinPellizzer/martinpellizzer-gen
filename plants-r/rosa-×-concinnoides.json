    "intro": "Rosa \u00d7 concinnoides, commonly known as the everblooming shrub rose, is a hybrid rose species resulting from crosses between Rosa rugosa and Rosa chinensis. It is characterized by its dense, thorny growth habit and its ability to produce flowers continuously throughout the growing season. The plant typically features small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, often with a high degree of variability in color and form. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for garden borders and hedges. Due to its hardiness and continuous blooming, it is well-suited for temperate climates and requires minimal maintenance."
