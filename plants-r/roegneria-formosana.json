    "intro": "Roegneria formosana, commonly known as the Japanese false brome, is a perennial grass native to East Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Roegneria formosana is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to form dense, attractive clumps."
