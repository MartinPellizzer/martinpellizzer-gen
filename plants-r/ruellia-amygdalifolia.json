    "intro": "Ruellia amygdalifolia, commonly known as the almond-leaved ruellia, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that have a slightly almond-like scent when crushed. The plant produces clusters of tubular, blue to purple flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Ruellia amygdalifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and blooms."
