    "intro": "Rubus macrostachys var. scabridus, commonly known as the rough-stemmed blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its rough, hairy stems and leaves, which give it its varietal name \"scabridus.\" The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically tart and less sweet compared to common blackberries. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in shaded, moist environments. Due to its unique appearance and flavor, it is occasionally cultivated for ornamental or culinary purposes."
