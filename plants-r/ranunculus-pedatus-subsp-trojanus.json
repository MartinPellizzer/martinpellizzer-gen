It features showy, yellow flowers with five to seven petals, typically blooming in early spring. The plant has palmately lobed leaves and prefers moist, well-drained soils in partial shade. It is often found in woodland edges and meadows, and it is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens. Its subspecific name, *trojanus*, alludes to its historical association with the Trojan region."
