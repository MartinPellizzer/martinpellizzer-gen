    "intro": "Racosperma piligerum, commonly known as the hairy wattle, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its yellow floral spikes and feathery leaves. The plant is typically found in sandy or rocky soils in arid and semi-arid regions. It produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Racosperma piligerum is often used in revegetation projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
