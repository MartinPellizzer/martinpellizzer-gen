    "intro": "Racosperma aphyllum, commonly known as the leafless acacia, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its lack of leaves, with photosynthesis occurring through its green stems. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in globular inflorescences. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability. Racosperma aphyllum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for native pollinators."
