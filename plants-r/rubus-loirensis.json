It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves, typical of the Rubus genus. The plant produces small, dark purple berries that are often used in local culinary traditions. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial shade. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species within its native habitat."
