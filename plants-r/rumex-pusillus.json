It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features a basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves with a distinctive reddish or purple coloration on the underside. Its small, greenish flowers are clustered in loose spikes and bloom in the spring. Rumex pusillus is often used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported diuretic and anti-inflammatory properties."
