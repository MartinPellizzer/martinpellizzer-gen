    "intro": "Rubus meijerianus, commonly known as Meijer's blackberry, is a species of brambles native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its thorny stems and aggregate fruits that ripen to a deep, dark purple color. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by the development of its edible berries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and thickets. The botanical features of Rubus meijerianus make it an important component of its native ecosystem."
