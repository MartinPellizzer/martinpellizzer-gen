    "intro": "Rhododendron anthopogon var. haemonium, commonly known as the Crimson Flame Rhododendron, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of China. It features striking, showy flowers that are typically a vibrant red or pink, with five to seven petals. The plant has leathery, dark green leaves that are elliptical in shape and arranged in whorls around the stems. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soil and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period, which extends from late spring to early summer."
