    "intro": "Rubus hebecaulis microgene nanus, commonly known as the dwarf raspberry, is a compact shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its small, trailing growth habit and produces small, red berries that ripen in late summer. The plant has trifoliate leaves with serrated edges and pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
