It belongs to the family Rytigyniaceae and is characterized by its smooth, dark-brown bark and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, followed by red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
