    "intro": "Rubus rigidus var. rigidus, commonly known as the prickly rose or brambles, is a shrub native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its thorny stems, which provide structural support and deter herbivores. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits called drupes, typically red or yellow in color, which are edible but often tart. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and its flowers are pink or white, appearing in early summer. Rubus rigidus var. rigidus is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of habitats, including woodlands and hedgerows."
