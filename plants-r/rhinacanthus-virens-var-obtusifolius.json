It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically smooth and glossy. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer, followed by bright red, flame-like fruits. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its striking foliage and vibrant fruit. The species is adapted to warm, humid climates and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
