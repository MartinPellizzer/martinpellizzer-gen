    "intro": "Rubus raduliformis, commonly known as the alpine raspberry, is a species of bramble native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its thorny stems and aggregate fruits that develop from multiple ovaria. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and its flowers are white with five petals. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
