    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 bavaricifolius, commonly known as the blackberry-loganberry hybrid, is a deciduous shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is a cross between the blackberry (Rubus ursinus) and the loganberry (Rubus \u00d7 loganobaccus), resulting in a plant with distinctive botanical features. The leaves are typically trifoliate, with a serrated margin and a dark green, glossy upper surface. Its flowers are small, white, and clustered in dense inflorescences, while the fruit is a large, dark purple to black aggregate berry. This hybrid is valued for its vigorous growth, adaptability to various soil types, and the production of flavorful, edible berries."
