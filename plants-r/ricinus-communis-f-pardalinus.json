    "intro": "Ricinus communis f. pardalinus, commonly known as the spotted castor bean, is a variant of the castor oil plant characterized by its distinctive foliage. The leaves are large, palmately lobed, and often have a striking pattern of red, purple, or brown spots. This cultivar is primarily grown for its ornamental value rather than for oil production. It thrives in warm climates and requires well-drained soil and full sun. The plant is toxic due to the presence of ricin in its seeds, so caution is necessary when handling it."
