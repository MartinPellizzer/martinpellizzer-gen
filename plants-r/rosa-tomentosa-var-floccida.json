    "intro": "Rosa tomentosa var. floccida, commonly known as the woolly rose, is a compact, shrub-like species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, grayish-white pubescence covering the stems, leaves, and flowers, giving it a distinctive, fluffy appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink to white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic, with a soft, velvety texture, and the plant is generally hardy in temperate climates. Rosa tomentosa var. floccida is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique, fuzzy foliage."
