    "intro": "Rubus latens, commonly known as the creeping raspberry, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and thorny stems, which help it spread across the ground. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits known as raspberries, which are typically red when ripe. Its leaves are alternate, trifoliate, and have serrated edges. Rubus latens thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
