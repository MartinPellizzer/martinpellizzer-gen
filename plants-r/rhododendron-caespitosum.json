    "intro": "Rhododendron caespitosum, commonly known as the mountain rhododendron, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Asia, particularly in China and the Himalayas. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and produces clusters of bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, and white. The plant thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers cool, moist environments with partial to full shade. Its leaves are typically dark green, leathery, and arranged in whorls around the stems. Rhododendron caespitosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its vibrant floral display."
