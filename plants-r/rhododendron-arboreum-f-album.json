It is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that bloom in spring, contrasting beautifully with its dark green, leathery foliage. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils and thrives in shaded to semi-shaded environments. Its leaves are elliptical and have a velvety texture, while its stems are robust and often covered in fine hairs. This cultivar is prized for its ornamental value in gardens and its role in the ecological systems of its native habitat."
