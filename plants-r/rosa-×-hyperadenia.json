    "intro": "Rosa \u00d7 hyperadenia, commonly known as the everblooming rose, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Rosa rugosa and Rosa multiflora. It is characterized by its ability to produce flowers continuously throughout the growing season, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. The plant typically features dark green, glossy foliage and produces clusters of fragrant, pink to red flowers. It is relatively disease-resistant and thrives in a variety of soil types, although it prefers full sun. Due to its hardiness and continuous blooming habit, it is well-suited for coastal and urban environments."
