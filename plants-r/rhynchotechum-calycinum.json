    "intro": "Rhynchotechum calycinum, commonly known as the golden star moss, is a rare and delicate liverwort belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as rock crevices or forest floors. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a thick layer of translucent cuticle, which helps reduce water loss. Rhynchotechum calycinum is primarily distributed in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and is often associated with calcareous substrates. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a specialist species with conservation concerns."
