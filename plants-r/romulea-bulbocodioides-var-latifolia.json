    "intro": "Romulea bulbocodioides var. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved romulea, is a perennial bulbous plant native to southern Africa. It features a cluster of fleshy, bulb-like structures that store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with a distinctive hooded shape, typical of the Iridaceae family. Its leaves are broad and grass-like, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes."
