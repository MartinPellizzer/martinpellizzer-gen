    "intro": "Rhysolepis macrorhiza, commonly known as the large-rooted sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its triangular, grass-like stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spike-like clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense stands, contributing to soil stabilization in marshy environments. Rhysolepis macrorhiza is often found in shallow water or saturated soils, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
