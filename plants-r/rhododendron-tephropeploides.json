    "intro": "Rhododendron tephropeploides, commonly known as the snow-capped rhododendron, is a rare and high-altitude species native to the Himalayas. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and showy, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, often found in forested areas at elevations above 3,000 meters. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, while its flowers range in color from white to pale pink. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species facing threats from climate change and habitat loss."
