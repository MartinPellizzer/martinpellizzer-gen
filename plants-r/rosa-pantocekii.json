    "intro": "Rosa pantocekii, commonly known as the Pantocek's rose, is a rare and delicate species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its fragrant, semi-double pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, with slender, thorny stems and dark green, serrated leaves. Its flowers are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological significance. Due to its limited natural range and habitat specificity, Rosa pantocekii is considered a conservation concern."
