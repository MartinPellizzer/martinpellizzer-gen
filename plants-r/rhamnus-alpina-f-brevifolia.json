    "intro": "Rhamnus alpina f. brevifolia, commonly known as the alpine buckthorn, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are usually less than 2 cm in length, giving it a compact appearance. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are followed by small, dark berries. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific environmental requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
