    "intro": "Rosa adenoclada, commonly known as the desert rose or rock rose, is a species of flowering plant native to arid regions of North Africa and the Middle East. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces showy, pink or red flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are small, oval, and often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, hard seeds."
