    "intro": "Rinorea batangae, commonly known as the Bornean rinorea, is a flowering plant native to the rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its showy, pentapetalous flowers. The plant typically grows as an understory shrub, with opposite, simple leaves that are often pubescent. Its flowers, which are usually pink or purple, bloom in clusters and attract various pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Rinorea batangae is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
