    "intro": "Rubus cornubiensis, commonly known as the Cornish bramble, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is native to the United Kingdom, particularly found in the county of Cornwall. The plant is characterized by its thorny stems, trifoliate leaves, and clusters of white flowers that bloom in early summer. Its fruit, a small, edible berry, is similar to other raspberries but is less commonly cultivated. The Cornish bramble plays an important role in local ecosystems, providing food and habitat for various wildlife species."
