    "intro": "Rhus ciliata, commonly known as smooth sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically arranged in pairs along the stems, and its clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces red, fuzzy berries that are a food source for birds and other wildlife. Rhus ciliata thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in woodland edges, thickets, and open areas. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a common sight in many eastern North American habitats."
