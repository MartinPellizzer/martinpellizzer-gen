    "intro": "Ricinocarpus neomexicanus, commonly known as the New Mexican ricin tree, is a rare and unique plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its woody structure and distinctive, palm-like leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by the development of its toxic, bean-like seeds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a unique example of plant adaptation in arid environments."
