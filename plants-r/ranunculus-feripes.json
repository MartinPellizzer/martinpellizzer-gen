    "intro": "Ranunculus feripes, commonly known as the alpine buttercup, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It features a basal rosette of lance-shaped, hairy leaves that are often tinged with silver. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky soils. Due to its delicate nature, it is sensitive to environmental changes and is considered a rare species in many areas."
