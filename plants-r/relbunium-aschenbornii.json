    "intro": "Relbunium aschenbornii, commonly known as the Aschenborn's relbunium, is a species of flowering plant belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. Native to southern Europe, this plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as rocky slopes and grasslands. The leaves are pinnately compound, with a distinctive serrated edge, and the plant is often found in Mediterranean climates. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and somewhat obscure member of the carrot family."
