    "intro": "Rothia indica subsp. australis, commonly known as the Australian rock fig, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and produces small, fleshy fruits that are an important food source for native wildlife. The plant is well adapted to dry conditions, with deep roots that allow it to access groundwater. It is often found in rocky outcrops and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for rehabilitation of degraded lands. Its botanical features make it an important component of local ecosystems and a valuable plant for ecological restoration projects."
