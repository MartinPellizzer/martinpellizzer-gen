    "intro": "Ridan alba, commonly known as the white dandelion, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of pale green, hairy leaves and a single, bright yellow flower that develops into a spherical seed head. The plant is often found in meadows, roadsides, and disturbed soils, thriving in full sun. Its flowers bloom from spring to early summer, and the plant is known for its rapid growth and ability to spread through wind-dispersed seeds. Ridan alba has no significant economic value but is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
