    "intro": "Rosa canina f. oxyodonta, commonly known as the sharp-lobed dog rose, is a botanical variant of the dog rose species. It is characterized by its distinctive, sharply toothed leaves and fragrant, pinkish-red flowers. The plant typically grows in shrub form, reaching heights of up to 2 meters. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in woodland edges and scrublands. Its hips, like those of the common dog rose, are edible and used in culinary and medicinal applications."
