    "intro": "Rhinanthus ponticus, commonly known as the Pontic yellowtop, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, commonly referred to as the broomrape family, and is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. Its small, lance-shaped leaves and showy inflorescence make it a distinctive member of its ecological community."
