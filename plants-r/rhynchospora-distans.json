    "intro": "Rhynchospora distans, commonly known as the distant spikerush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in the eastern United States. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and rushes, and is characterized by its triangular stems and spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, arranged in dense clusters, and it plays a role in supporting local biodiversity. Rhynchospora distans is an important indicator species for wetland health and ecological stability."
