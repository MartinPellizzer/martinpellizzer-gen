    "intro": "Rosifax, commonly known as the rosebay willowherb, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North America. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that often grow up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces showy pink to red flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its seeds are dispersed by wind. Rosifax is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in open fields."
