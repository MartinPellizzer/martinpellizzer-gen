    "intro": "Rumex azoricus, commonly known as Azorean sorrel, is a perennial herb native to the Azores. It features alternate, broadly ovate to elliptic leaves with a distinctive reddish or purplish coloration on the underside. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in dense, terminal clusters during the spring and early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. The leaves are edible and have a slightly tart flavor, similar to other members of the Rumex genus."
