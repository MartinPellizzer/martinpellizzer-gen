    "intro": "Rumex parvifolius, commonly known as narrow-leaved dock, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features basal leaves that are narrow and lance-shaped, with a rough, hairy texture on both surfaces. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in dense clusters during the summer months. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in wet meadows. Its leaves and stems are sometimes used in traditional medicine for their astringent properties."
