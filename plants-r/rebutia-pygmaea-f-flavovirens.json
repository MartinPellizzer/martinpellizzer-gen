It features a globular or cylindrical stem with a smooth, pale green to yellowish-green surface. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red during the spring and early summer. It is well-suited for rock gardens and containers due to its compact size and drought tolerance. Its foliage and flowers provide a striking contrast, making it a popular choice for succulent enthusiasts."
