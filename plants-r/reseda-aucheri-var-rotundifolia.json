    "intro": "Reseda aucheri var. rotundifolia, commonly known as the roundleaf reseda, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It features basal rosettes of rounded, fleshy leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its ornamental value comes from its compact growth habit and long-lasting blooms."
