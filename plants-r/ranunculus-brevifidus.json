    "intro": "Ranunculus brevifidus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features delicate, cup-shaped flowers with yellow stamens and a white or yellow center, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has palmately divided leaves that are usually lobed and have a slightly hairy surface. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in some environments."
