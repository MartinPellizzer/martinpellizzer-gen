    "intro": "Rafnia perfoliata, commonly known as the perfoliate ragwort, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its basal rosette of dark green, hairy leaves that are often perforated at the base, giving it its common name. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months, which attract various pollinators. Rafnia perfoliata is typically found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid conditions. It is considered a perennial species, often growing in open areas with well-drained soils."
