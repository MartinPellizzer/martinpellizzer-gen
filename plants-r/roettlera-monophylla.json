    "intro": "Roettlera monophylla, commonly known as the single-leaf roettlera, is a rare and striking member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its single, large, palmate leaf that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces small, white to yellowish flowers arranged in a flat-topped cluster, which bloom in the summer months. Native to the arid regions of South Africa, it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts of rare plants."
