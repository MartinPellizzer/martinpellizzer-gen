It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many other mustard family plants. The plant is characterized by its small, white or yellowish flowers and its distinctive, undulating leaf margins. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in degraded landscapes."
