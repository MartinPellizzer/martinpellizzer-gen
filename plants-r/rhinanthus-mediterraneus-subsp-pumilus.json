    "intro": "Rhinanthus mediterraneus subsp. pumilus, commonly known as the dwarf yellow-rattle, is a flowering plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on its host plants for water and nutrients. This subspecies is typically found in grasslands and open habitats across southern Europe. The plant produces small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom from late spring to early summer. Its presence can influence the structure and diversity of the surrounding vegetation by reducing the competitiveness of dominant grasses."
