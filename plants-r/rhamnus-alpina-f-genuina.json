    "intro": "Rhamnus alpina f. genuina, commonly known as the alpine buckthorn, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its small, glossy leaves and produces clusters of yellowish-green flowers in early spring. The plant is adapted to harsh alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. Its fruit is a small, dark reddish-brown drupe that ripens in late summer. This subspecies is notable for its ecological importance in stabilizing soil and providing food for wildlife in high-altitude habitats."
