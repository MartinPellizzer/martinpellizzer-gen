    "intro": "Rubus idaeus var. gracilipes, commonly known as the slender-fruited raspberry, is a variant of the red raspberry species. It is characterized by its delicate, elongated fruits that are typically smaller and more fragrant than those of the standard raspberry. The plant produces biennial canes that grow from perennial rootstocks, with the flowering and fruiting occurring on the second-year stems. Its leaves are compound, with three to five leaflets, and the flowers are white with five petals. This variety is often cultivated for its unique flavor and is valued in both culinary and ornamental horticulture."
