    "intro": "Rapuntium decurrens, commonly known as the creeping buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a spreading growth habit with rhizomes that allow it to colonize moist, disturbed soils effectively. The plant has alternate, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces bright yellow flowers with five petals. It is known for its ability to thrive in wet environments such as marshes and stream banks. However, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid spread and competitive nature."
