    "intro": "Rosa corymbifera var. umbrosa, commonly known as the shade rose, is a compact shrub native to the forests of eastern North America. It features dark green, elliptical leaves that are often densely packed, providing a lush, shaded appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its growth habit is upright and bushy, with thorny stems that offer structural interest. This variety is well-suited for woodland gardens due to its preference for partial to full shade and moist, well-drained soil."
