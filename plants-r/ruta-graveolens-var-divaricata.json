    "intro": "Ruta graveolens var. divaricata, commonly known as the fragrant rue, is a variant of the common rue plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is a shrub characterized by its aromatic, pinnately compound leaves and small yellowish-green flowers. The plant contains volatile oils, including thujone, which contribute to its strong, bitter odor. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or dry environments. Due to its toxic properties, it is typically cultivated with caution."
