    "intro": "Rubus lloydianus var. setosoglandulosus, commonly known as the hairy glandular blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to certain regions of North America. It is characterized by its thorny stems and dark purple to black berries that mature in the fall. The leaves are typically compound, with three to five leaflets that have a serrated edge. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, which are pollinated by insects. Its berries are edible but often have a tart flavor, making them suitable for jams and pies."
