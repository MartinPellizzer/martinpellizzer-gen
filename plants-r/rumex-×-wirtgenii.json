    "intro": "Rumex \u00d7 wirtgenii, commonly known as the hybrid sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Polygonaceae family. It is a natural hybrid between Rumex acetosa (common sorrel) and Rumex acetobulus (broad-leaved sorrel), resulting in a plant with distinctive morphological features. The leaves are typically heart-shaped with a serrated margin and a reddish or purple underside, which can be a distinguishing trait. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks. This hybrid is valued for its edible leaves, which have a tart flavor similar to other sorrels."
