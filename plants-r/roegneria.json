    "intro": "Roegneria, commonly known as false brome, is a genus of grasses belonging to the family Poaceae. These plants are typically found in temperate regions and are characterized by their tufted growth habit and slender, often blue-green foliage. Many species of Roegneria are perennial and can form dense mats, making them useful for erosion control. They produce small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. The genus includes several species, some of which are cultivated for ornamental purposes due to their attractive appearance and hardiness."
