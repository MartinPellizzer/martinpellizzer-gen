It is a member of the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its woody stems and dense, sprawling growth habit. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by small, three-lobed fruits. Its leaves are typically opposite, elliptic to ovate in shape, and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Rhigozum linifolium is often found in moist, disturbed soils along stream banks and in woodland edges."
