    "intro": "Rungia crenata, commonly known as the wax plant or waxleaf hibiscus, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, typically blooming during the summer months. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Rungia crenata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and vibrant floral display."
