    "intro": "Robinia pseudoacacia var. rozynskiana, commonly known as the Rozynskiana false acacia, is a variant of the honey locust tree native to Europe. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically longer and more slender than those of the standard Robinia pseudoacacia. The plant produces yellowish-green pods that contain flattened, edible seeds. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in open woodlands or along roadsides. Its botanical features make it a notable species in both horticulture and ecological studies."
