It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring thorny stems and dark green, ovate leaves with glandular dots. The plant produces fragrant, pink to red flowers in late spring to early summer, which are borne on long pedicels. Its foliage is often covered with small, glandular hairs, giving it its common name. Rosa semiglandulosa is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens for its beauty and hardiness."
