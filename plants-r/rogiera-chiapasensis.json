    "intro": "Rogiera chiapasensis, commonly known as the Chiapas rogiera, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the high-altitude cloud forests of southern Mexico. It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, which bloom during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are evergreen, leathery, and densely arranged, providing a dense canopy that helps retain moisture in its humid habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Rogiera chiapasensis is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and climate change."
