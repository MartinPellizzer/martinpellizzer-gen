    "intro": "Ruehssia altissima, commonly known as the giant ruehssia, is a striking evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, upright growth habit and broad, leathery leaves that are dark green on top and silver-white underneath. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its unique appearance and ornamental value make it a popular choice for rock gardens and as a specimen plant in botanical collections. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in controlled environments to ensure its survival."
