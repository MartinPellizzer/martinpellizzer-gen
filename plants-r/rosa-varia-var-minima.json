    "intro": "Rosa varia var. minima, commonly known as the miniature rose or dwarf shrub rose, is a compact, deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has finely cut, dark green leaves and produces red or orange hips in the autumn. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a hedge plant. Due to its small size, it is well-suited for container gardening and small spaces."
