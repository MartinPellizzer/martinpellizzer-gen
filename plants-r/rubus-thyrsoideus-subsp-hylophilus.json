    "intro": "Rubus thyrsoideus subsp. hylophilus, commonly known as the red raspberry bush, is a species of bramble native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its thorny stems, trifoliate leaves, and clusters of small, red, edible berries. The plant typically grows in moist, wooded areas and thrives in partial to full shade. Its flowers are white with five petals, and the berries are often used in jams and culinary applications. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly smaller leaves and more compact growth habit compared to other Rubus species."
