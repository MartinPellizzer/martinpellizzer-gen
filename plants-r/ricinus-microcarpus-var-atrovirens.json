    "intro": "Ricinus microcarpus var. atrovirens, commonly known as the black-leaved castor, is a variant of the castor oil plant characterized by its dark green to black foliage. It is a perennial shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in parts of Africa and Asia. The plant produces distinctive spiny capsules that contain toxic seeds, which are used in traditional medicine and as a source of castor oil. Its leaves are palmately lobed and can grow up to 30 cm in length, contributing to its ornamental value. Due to its toxicity, it requires careful handling and is often cultivated in controlled environments."
