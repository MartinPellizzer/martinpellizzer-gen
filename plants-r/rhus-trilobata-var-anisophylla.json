    "intro": "Rhus trilobata var. anisophylla, commonly known as the three-lobed sumac, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves that are trifoliate, with three leaflets that are often asymmetrical, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in upright clusters, which are followed by red, fuzzy berries that are a food source for birds. Its leaves and fruits contain compounds that have been used in traditional medicine, though it can be toxic in large quantities. The shrub thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodland edges and thickets."
