    "intro": "Rubus sulcatus var. cuspidatus, commonly known as the sharp-fruited blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically tart and less sweet compared to common blackberries. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. The botanical features of this variant make it distinct from other Rubus species, particularly in its fruit structure and leaf morphology."
