It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its erect, herbaceous stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in swampy areas or along the edges of lakes.
