    "intro": "Rubus hirtus var. grandiflorus, commonly known as the large-flowered blackberry, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its prickly stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces aggregate fruits, known as blackberries, which are typically dark purple to black when mature. These berries are edible, though they are often tart and require cooking or processing for consumption. It thrives in woodland edges and disturbed soils, preferring partial to full sun."
