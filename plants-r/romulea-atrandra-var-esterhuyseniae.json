    "intro": "Romulea atrandra var. esterhuyseniae, commonly known as the Esterhuysenia romulea, is a perennial bulbous plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its striking, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, rounded bulbs that help it survive in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long-lasting blooms and unique foliage structure."
