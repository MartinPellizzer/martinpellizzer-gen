    "intro": "Racosperma littoreum, commonly known as the coastal wattle, is a shrub native to coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom during the spring and summer seasons. The plant has small, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, adapting to the salty and windy conditions of its habitat. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found along shorelines and dunes. Racosperma littoreum plays an important role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for native wildlife."
