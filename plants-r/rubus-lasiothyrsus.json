    "intro": "Rubus lasiothyrsus, commonly known as the woolly blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the western United States. It is characterized by its woody stems and trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black when mature. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, sunny locations. Due to its thorny growth habit, it is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and forest edges."
