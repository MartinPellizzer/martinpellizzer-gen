    "intro": "Ryticaryum oleraceum, commonly known as the common groundsel, is a flowering plant native to Europe, western Asia, and northern Africa. It is an annual herb that grows up to 60 cm tall, featuring hairy stems and alternate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by spherical, rough-seeded fruits. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
