    "intro": "Rubus chlorostachys f. tremulinus, commonly known as the silver-leaved blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant characterized by its distinctive silvery-white undersides on its leaves. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is native to parts of Asia, particularly China. The plant produces small, dark purple berries that are edible but often less flavorful compared to other blackberry varieties. Its leaves are typically ovate with a serrated edge, and the stems are covered in fine, white hairs. This form is notable for its ornamental value due to its striking foliage."
