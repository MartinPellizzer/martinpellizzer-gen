    "intro": "Ranunculus palustris subsp. macrophyllus, commonly known as the broadleaf water buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features showy, yellow flowers with five petals and numerous stamens, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has alternate, heart-shaped leaves that are often larger than those of the typical *Ranunculus palustris*. It thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Due to its preference for wet environments, it plays a role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
