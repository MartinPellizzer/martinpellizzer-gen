    "intro": "Rosa remensis, commonly known as the swamp rose, is a deciduous shrub native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in swampy areas, along stream banks, and in other moist environments. The plant features arching stems with simple, pinnately compound leaves that have serrated edges. Its flowers are usually pink to red, with five petals and numerous stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer. Rosa remensis produces rose hips that are reddish-orange and contain seeds, contributing to its ecological role in supporting wildlife."
