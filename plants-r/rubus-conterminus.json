    "intro": "Rubus conterminus, commonly known as the coastal blackberry, is a shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, dark purple berries that are typically edible and have a tart flavor. It thrives in coastal areas with sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in moist, temperate climates. Rubus conterminus plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing food for wildlife and stabilizing coastal dunes."
