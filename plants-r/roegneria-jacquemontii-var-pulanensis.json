    "intro": "Roegneria jacquemontii var. pulanensis, commonly known as the Pulan wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Tibetan Plateau. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear florets with pale yellow to brown flowers. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool temperatures and well-drained soils. This variety is valued for its hardiness and is often used in ecological restoration projects in arid and semi-arid regions."
