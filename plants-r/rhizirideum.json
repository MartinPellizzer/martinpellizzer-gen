    "intro": "Rhizirideum, commonly known as the swamp buttercup, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It features a basal rosette of broad, waxy leaves that help retain moisture in its moist habitat. The plant produces yellow flowers with five petals, typical of the Ranunculaceae family. Its roots form a dense network that aids in soil stabilization and nutrient absorption. Rhizirideum is often found in marshes, bogs, and along the edges of ponds."
