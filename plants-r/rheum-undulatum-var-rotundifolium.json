It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in the Tian Shan and Pamir Mountains. The plant produces tall, stout stems that bear clusters of yellowish-green flowers in late spring. Its leaves are large, heart-shaped, and often used in traditional medicine for their medicinal properties. This variety is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its potential health benefits."
