    "intro": "Rubus anglohirtus, commonly known as the hairy bramble, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is native to parts of Europe and is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of white or pale yellow flowers. The plant produces small, red, edible berries that are similar to raspberries but have a distinct, slightly tart flavor. It thrives in woodland edges and disturbed soils, often forming dense thickets. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas."
