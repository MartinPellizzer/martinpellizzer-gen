    "intro": "Rumex \u00d7 rhaeticus, commonly known as the red sorrel, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Rumex acetosa (common sorrel) and Rumex acetobipinatus (greater sorrel). It is characterized by its distinctive reddish stems and heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in loose clusters, typically blooming in early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along the edges of wetlands. The leaves are edible but contain oxalic acid, so they should be consumed in moderation."
