It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers that bloom from June to August. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on the roots of other plants for nutrients. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as grasslands and heaths. Its small, delicate flowers are often visited by bees and other pollinators."
