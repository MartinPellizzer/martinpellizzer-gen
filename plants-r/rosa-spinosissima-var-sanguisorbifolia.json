    "intro": "Rosa spinosissima var. sanguisorbifolia, commonly known as the bloodroot rose, is a hybrid shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and large, velvety leaves that resemble those of the sanguisorba plant, hence its botanical name. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers in late spring to early summer. Its foliage turns a striking red in the fall, adding to its ornamental value. It is typically grown in well-drained soil and requires full sun to thrive."
