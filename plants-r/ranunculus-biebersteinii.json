    "intro": "Ranunculus biebersteinii, commonly known as the Siberian buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features delicate, palmately lobed leaves and bright yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in early summer. The plant prefers well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. It has a short stem and produces small, hairy fruits that disperse its seeds by wind. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
