    "intro": "Rhamnus alaternus f. longifolia, commonly known as the long-leaved buckthorn, is a shrub characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, oval-shaped leaves. The leaves are typically longer and more elongated compared to the typical form of Rhamnus alaternus, giving it a distinct appearance. It produces yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by small, dark blue berries that are edible but often bitter. This plant is native to southern Europe and is often found in rocky or dry habitats. It has been used historically in traditional medicine for its astringent properties."
