    "intro": "Racosperma graniticum, commonly known as the granite acacia, is a shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted stems and bipinnate leaves that are reduced to small, scale-like structures. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense, globular clusters, which are typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand extreme drought conditions. Racosperma graniticum plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and provides shelter for various small animals."
