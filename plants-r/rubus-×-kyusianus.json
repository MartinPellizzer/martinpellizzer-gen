    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 kyusianus, commonly known as the blackberry raspberry, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Rubus ursinus (the common blackberry) and Rubus idaeus (the red raspberry). It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces aggregate fruits, known as drupes, which are typically dark purple to black in color when mature. These fruits are valued for their sweet-tart flavor and are commonly used in culinary applications. The plant thrives in temperate climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
