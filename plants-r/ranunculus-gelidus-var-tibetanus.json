    "intro": "Ranunculus gelidus var. tibetanus, commonly known as the Tibetan buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau. It features delicate, yellow flowers with five petals and numerous stamens, typical of the Ranunculaceae family. The plant thrives in cold, moist environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of alpine meadows. Its leaves are palmately divided, and the stems are hairy, providing some insulation against the cold. It plays a vital role in the local ecosystem, supporting pollinators and contributing to the biodiversity of its habitat."
