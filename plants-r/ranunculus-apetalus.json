The plant typically produces clusters of bright yellow stamens surrounded by a ring of leaf-like structures. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. The species is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique floral structure."
