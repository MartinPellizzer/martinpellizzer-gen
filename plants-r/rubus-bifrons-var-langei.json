    "intro": "Rubus bifrons var. langei, commonly known as the Lange's blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to certain regions of South America. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that ripen to a dark purple or black color, typically in late summer. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
