    "intro": "Rhododendron capitatum, commonly known as the alpine rhododendron, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, preferring well-drained, acidic soils and cool, moist climates. Its floral display is often vibrant, ranging from pink to red, and it plays an important role in its native ecosystems. Rhododendron capitatum is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental qualities and adaptability to specific garden conditions."
