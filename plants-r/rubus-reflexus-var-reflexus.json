    "intro": "Rubus reflexus var. reflexus, commonly known as the reflexed blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its thorny stems, trifoliate leaves, and small, aggregate fruits that mature to a dark purple or black color. The plant produces white to pale yellow flowers in the spring, which are clustered in umbels. Its botanical features include hairy stems and leaves, and it thrives in moist, wooded areas. This variant is notable for its relatively small size compared to other Rubus species."
