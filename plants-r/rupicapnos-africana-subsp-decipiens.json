It is characterized by its woody stems and compound leaves with a feathery appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by small, red berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely known outside of its native range."
