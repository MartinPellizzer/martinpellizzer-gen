    "intro": "Rubus karafutoanus, commonly known as the Sakhalin raspberry, is a species of bramble native to the Russian Far East and parts of northern Japan. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red when ripe, though they can vary in color. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in moist, shaded areas such as forests and shrublands. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical studies."
