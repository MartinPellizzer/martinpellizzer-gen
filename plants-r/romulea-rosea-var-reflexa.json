It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that bloom in spring. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces spikes of pale pink to white flowers with reflexed petals. It thrives in wet, marshy environments and is often found in damp grasslands or along water margins. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
