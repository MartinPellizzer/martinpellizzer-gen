It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and dark green, leathery leaves covered in a fine silvery down. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by edible blackberries in late summer. Its fruit is typically small, tart, and often used in jams or desserts. The silverleaf blackberry is well adapted to rocky and arid environments, thriving in full sun."
