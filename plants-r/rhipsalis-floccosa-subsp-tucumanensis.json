    "intro": "Rhipsalis floccosa subsp. tucumanensis, commonly known as the Tucum\u00e1n Rhipsalis, is a species of cactus native to South America, particularly in Argentina and Bolivia. It is characterized by its soft, hair-like stems that are often covered in a dense, white, woolly coating. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically borne in clusters along the stems. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in tropical forests. Due to its unique appearance and slow growth, it is a popular choice for indoor cultivation."
