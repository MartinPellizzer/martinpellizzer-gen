    "intro": "Ranunculus microflorus, commonly known as the dwarf buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features delicate, bright yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in early spring. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are hairy beneath, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained, moist soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its small size and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and rockeries."
