    "intro": "Rhinanthus columnae, commonly known as the columnar yellow-rattle, is a flowering plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on its host plants for water and nutrients. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. It is native to western Europe and thrives in open habitats such as grasslands and heaths. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
