It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its daisy-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky and sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid regions. It produces small, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
