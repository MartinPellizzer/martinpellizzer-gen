    "intro": "Rubus anglosaxonicus var. setulosus, commonly known as the brambles or blackberries, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its thorny stems, trifoliate leaves, and aggregate fruits that develop from multiple ovaria. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it thrives in a variety of soil types, particularly in moist, well-drained conditions. It produces edible berries that are widely used in culinary applications, though the plant itself can be invasive in certain regions. The flowers are typically white or pink, and they bloom in the spring before the foliage emerges."
