    "intro": "Rubus longicuspis, commonly known as the long-cusped blackberry, is a species of bramble native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its thorny stems and aggregate fruits, which are typically dark purple to black in color. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by the development of its edible berries in the summer. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the plant thrives in moist, wooded areas. Rubus longicuspis is an important food source for wildlife and has been used in traditional herbal medicine."
