    "intro": "Rosa communis var. virginea, commonly known as the sweet briar rose, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems, fragrant pink or white flowers, and compound leaves with five to seven leaflets. The plant produces rose hips, which are the fruit containing seeds. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often found in hedgerows and woodland edges. Its ornamental value and historical use in hedging and perfume-making make it a notable botanical species."
