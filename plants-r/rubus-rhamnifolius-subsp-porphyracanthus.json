    "intro": "Rubus rhamnifolius subsp. porphyracanthus, commonly known as the red-stemmed blackberry, is a shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its thorny stems, which are often reddish in color, and its compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, white flowers that give way to dark purple or black berries in the fall. These berries are edible, though they are generally less sweet and more tart compared to other blackberry varieties. It thrives in moist, woodland environments and is often found in the understory of forests."
