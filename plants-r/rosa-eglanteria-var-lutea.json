    "intro": "Rosa eglanteria var. lutea, commonly known as the yellow prickly rose, is a deciduous shrub native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces showy yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are followed by red, hairy fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often found in hedgerows and woodland edges. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
