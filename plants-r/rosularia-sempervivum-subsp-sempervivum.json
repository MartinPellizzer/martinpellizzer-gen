    "intro": "Rosularia sempervivum subsp. sempervivum, commonly known as the common stonecrop, is a low-growing perennial plant characterized by its rosette-forming leaves. It belongs to the family Crassulaceae and is native to Europe and parts of Asia. The plant features fleshy, often blue-green or silver-gray leaves that are covered in a waxy cuticle, helping it retain moisture in arid conditions. It produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the summer months. This species is well adapted to rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or mountainous regions."
