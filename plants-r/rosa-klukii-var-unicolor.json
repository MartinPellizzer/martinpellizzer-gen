    "intro": "Rosa klukii var. unicolor, commonly known as the single-flowered rose, is a rare and unique variant of the Rosa klukii species. It is characterized by its single, large, and showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink to white. The plant is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in the Altai Mountains. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
