    "intro": "Rubus abactus, commonly known as the alpine raspberry, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and thorny stems. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or black in color, similar to other raspberries. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
