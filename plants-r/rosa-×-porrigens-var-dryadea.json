    "intro": "Rosa \u00d7 porrigens var. dryadea, commonly known as the dryad's rose, is a hybrid shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its dense, thornless growth habit and clusters of fragrant, pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces oval, dark green leaves with a slightly hairy texture, and its stems are covered in fine, silvery pubescence. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. This variety is also valued for its hardiness and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
