    "intro": "Roepera ammophila, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, often blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune environments, where it plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes. It is a perennial herb with a low-growing habit, featuring narrow, linear leaves that are adapted to withstand coastal conditions. Roepera ammophila is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable drainage."
