    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 obtusicaulis, commonly known as the Pacific blackberry, is a hybrid plant species native to western North America. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces aggregate fruits, which are typically dark purple to black in color when mature. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, moist environments. Due to its invasive potential, it is often found in disturbed areas and along forest edges."
