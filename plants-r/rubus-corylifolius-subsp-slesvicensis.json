    "intro": "Rubus corylifolius subsp. slesvicensis, commonly known as the Slesvician bramble, is a shrub native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically trifoliate or pinnate, and its small, aggregate fruits that develop from multiple flowers. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, and it produces achenes that are dispersed by wind. This subspecies is notable for its horticultural value and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
