    "intro": "Rhynchosia arenaria, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid and coastal regions of Africa, the Americas, and Australia. It is a herbaceous annual or perennial that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, showcasing its adaptability to harsh environments. The plant produces small, showy flowers that range in color from white to purple, often arranged in clusters at the ends of its branches. Its leaves are usually narrow and hairy, which helps reduce water loss in dry conditions. Rhynchosia arenaria is also valued for its role in stabilizing soil and supporting local pollinator populations."
