    "intro": "Ribes album, commonly known as white currant, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by edible berries that ripen in late summer. The plant is characterized by its alternate, simple leaves with serrated edges and a woody stem that becomes more prominent with age. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for gardens and hedgerows. Ribes album is also valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
