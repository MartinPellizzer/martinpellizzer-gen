    "intro": "Riedelia exalata, commonly known as the silverleaf riedelia, is a flowering plant native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is a member of the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its spiny stems and clusters of yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. Riedelia exalata is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its unique appearance and resilience."
