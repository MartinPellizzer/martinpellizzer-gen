    "intro": "Rubus adamsii, commonly known as Adams' blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves, typical of the Rubus genus. The plant produces small, dark red berries that are edible and often used in local cuisines. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
