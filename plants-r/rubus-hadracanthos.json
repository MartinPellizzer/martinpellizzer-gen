    "intro": "Rubus hadracanthos, commonly known as the rough thimbleberry, is a species of bramble native to North America. It is characterized by its trailing or climbing growth habit and produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant's leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and its fruit is a red, edible berry similar to raspberries. It thrives in moist, wooded areas and is often found in the Pacific Northwest. The rough thimbleberry is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
