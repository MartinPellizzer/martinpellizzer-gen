    "intro": "Rhus aromatica, commonly known as smooth sumac, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and turn bright red in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in panicles, followed by red, fuzzy fruits that are a common food source for birds. Smooth sumac thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in dry, disturbed soils. Its aromatic leaves and fruits make it a distinctive and ecologically important species in woodland habitats."
