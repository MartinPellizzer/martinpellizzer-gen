It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and cylindrical, hairy pods that contain edible seeds. The plant is often grown for its protein-rich seeds, which are used in local cuisines. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is adapted to poor soil conditions. Rhynchosia punctata also plays a role in nitrogen fixation, improving soil fertility."
