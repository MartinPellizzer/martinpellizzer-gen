    "intro": "Rumohra berteroana, commonly known as the grass tree or *Punga*, is a distinctive plant native to the Pacific Islands, including Hawaii, Tahiti, and other parts of Oceania. It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its tall, narrow leaves that form a dense rosette. The plant produces small, spadix-like inflorescences that are often surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Rumohra berteroana is adapted to coastal and rocky environments, often growing in areas with high salt exposure and strong winds. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in its native ecosystems."
