    "intro": "Richardia macrocarpa, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter, floating on the surface of still or slow-moving freshwater bodies. The plant produces showy white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its roots are anchored in the sediment at the bottom of the water body, while its rhizomes spread horizontally to form dense mats. The leaves have a waxy cuticle that prevents water from penetrating, allowing the plant to thrive in aquatic environments."
