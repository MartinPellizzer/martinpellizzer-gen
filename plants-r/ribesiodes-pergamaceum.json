    "intro": "Ribesiodes pergamaceum, commonly known as the velvetleaf or false velvetleaf, is a tropical plant characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is native to regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.
