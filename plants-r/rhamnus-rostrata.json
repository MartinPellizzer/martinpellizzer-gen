    "intro": "Rhamnus rostrata, commonly known as the red-leafed buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that turn a striking red or orange in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by dark blue berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and thickets. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
