    "intro": "Rhamnus carpinifolia, commonly known as the common buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of 2\u20134 meters and features dark green, oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by dark blue berries that are a food source for birds. It is often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and stream banks. Rhamnus carpinifolia is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in dye production."
