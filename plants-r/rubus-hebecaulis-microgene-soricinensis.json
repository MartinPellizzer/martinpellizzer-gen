    "intro": "Rubus hebecaulis microgene soricinensis, commonly known as the Soricin's bramble, is a rare shrub native to specific regions of Eastern Europe. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its slender, thorny stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces white to pale pink flowers in late spring, followed by red, hairy berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival. Its botanical features make it a unique and ecologically significant species in its native environment."
