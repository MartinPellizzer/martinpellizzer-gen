    "intro": "Rosa tomentella var. microphylla, commonly known as the miniature rugosa rose, is a compact shrub native to China. It is characterized by its densely hairy stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white, typically blooming in early summer. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and hardy nature. Due to its small size, it is well-suited for rock gardens or as a container plant."
