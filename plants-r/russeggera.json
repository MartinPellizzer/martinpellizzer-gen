It is native to regions of South America, particularly in the Andes, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plants are characterized by their striking, often velvety, blue or purple flowers that bloom in spring. Russeggera species are shrubs or small trees with woody stems and alternate, simple leaves.
