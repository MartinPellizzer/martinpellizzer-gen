    "intro": "Rosa grata, commonly known as the sweetbriar rose, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of fragrant, white or pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, red-orange hips that contain seeds, which are often used in herbal remedies. Rosa grata typically grows in woodland edges, hedgerows, and moist soils, and it can reach heights of up to 2 meters. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with five to seven oval-shaped leaflets that are glossy and dark green."
