    "intro": "Rumicastrum polyandrum, commonly known as the desert star, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to survive in harsh, drought conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are usually small, linear, and covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss. The species is valued for its resilience and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
