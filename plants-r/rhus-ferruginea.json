    "intro": "Rhus ferruginea, commonly known as the rusty winged sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and have a serrated margin. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by red, fuzzy fruits that are a source of food for birds and small mammals. Its bark is thick and fissured, often appearing reddish-brown, and it thrives in dry, sandy soils. Rhus ferruginea is also notable for its ability to tolerate harsh environmental conditions, making it a hardy species in its native habitat."
