    "intro": "Racinaea lymansmithiana, commonly known as the Lymansmith's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent leaves and a single, striking white or pale purple flower that blooms infrequently. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its unique morphology and habitat requirements make it highly sensitive to environmental changes. Due to its rarity and specific ecological needs, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
