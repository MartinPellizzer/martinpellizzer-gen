    "intro": "Robinia pseudoacacia f. crispa, commonly known as the crisped false acacia, is a cultivar of the black locust tree characterized by its uniquely crinkled or wavy leaves. This ornamental feature is a result of genetic variation and is most pronounced on the upper surface of the foliage. The plant retains the typical growth habits of Robinia pseudoacacia, including its rapid growth and compound leaves, but the leaf morphology sets it apart. It is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal in gardens and landscapes. The species is native to the southeastern United States, but the cultivar is widely grown in temperate regions for its ornamental value."
