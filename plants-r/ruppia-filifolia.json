    "intro": "Ruppia filifolia, commonly known as the slender waterplantain, is a halophytic species that thrives in brackish and saline wetlands. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves that are often submerged or floating, adapted to aquatic environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are typically arranged in spike-like clusters. Ruppia filifolia is widely distributed across coastal regions and estuaries in temperate zones. Its ecological importance includes stabilizing sediment and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
