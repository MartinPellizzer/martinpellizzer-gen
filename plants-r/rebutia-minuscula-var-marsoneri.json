    "intro": "Rebutia minuscula var. marsoneri, commonly known as the Marsoner's Rebutia, is a compact cactus native to South America. It features short, cylindrical stems that are often ribbed and covered in small, white to pale green spines. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It is well-suited for rock gardens and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its slow growth rate makes it an ideal choice for container gardening."
