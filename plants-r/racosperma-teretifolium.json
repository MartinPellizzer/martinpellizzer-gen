    "intro": "Racosperma teretifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved wattle, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, often zigzagging stems and small, bright yellow flowers. The plant has bipinnate leaves that are narrow and linear, giving it a distinctive appearance. It is typically found in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to thrive in arid environments. Racosperma teretifolium is often used in revegetation projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen and stabilize soil."
