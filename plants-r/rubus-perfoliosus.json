    "intro": "Rubus perfoliosus, commonly known as the hooked bramble, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with three to five leaflets. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in early summer, which are followed by red, edible berries. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, acidic conditions. Rubus perfoliosus is often found in woodlands, hedgerows, and disturbed areas, where it plays a role in supporting local wildlife."
