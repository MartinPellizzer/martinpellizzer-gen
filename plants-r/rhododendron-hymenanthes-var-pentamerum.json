    "intro": "Rhododendron hymenanthes var. pentamerum, commonly known as the five-merous rhododendron, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and showy, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters, preferring well-drained, acidic soils. Its flowers, which are usually pink to reddish in color, bloom in late spring to early summer. The variety is distinguished by its five stamens, a feature that sets it apart from the typical eight-stamen form of the species."
