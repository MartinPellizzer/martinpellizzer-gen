    "intro": "Rubus bujedanus, commonly known as the Bujedan blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves, typical of the Rubus genus. The plant produces small, dark purple berries that are often used in local traditional medicine. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
