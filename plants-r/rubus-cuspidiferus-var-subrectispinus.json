    "intro": "Rubus cuspidiferus var. subrectispinus, commonly known as the prickly blackberry, is a variant of the common blackberry species native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its thorny stems and dark purple to black berries that ripen in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, wooded areas and thrives in partial to full sun. Its foliage consists of trifoliate leaves with serrated edges, and it produces compound inflorescences with small, white flowers. This variety is valued for its hardiness and is often found in naturalized settings across its native range."
