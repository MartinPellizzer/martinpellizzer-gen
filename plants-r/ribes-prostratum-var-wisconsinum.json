It features small, oval leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly rough texture. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by edible, tart berries that ripen in late summer. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. This variety is valued for its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine."
