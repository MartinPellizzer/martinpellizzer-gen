    "intro": "Rosa dumalis f. insignis, commonly known as the alpine rose, is a rare and ornamental plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a compact shrub with dark green, leathery leaves and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant is adapted to harsh alpine conditions, thriving in well-drained soil and full sun. Its unique floral characteristics and hardy nature make it a prized specimen in specialized gardens. Due to its limited distribution and conservation status, it is often cultivated in controlled environments."
