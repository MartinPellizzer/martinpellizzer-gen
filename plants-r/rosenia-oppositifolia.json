    "intro": "Rosenia oppositifolia, commonly known as the opposite-leaved rosenia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its opposite arrangement of small, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces clusters of tiny, fragrant white flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
