It is characterized by its distinctive silvery-white undersides on its leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically edible. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and streambanks. Rubus irroratus is a perennial shrub that can grow up to 3 meters tall, with thorny stems and compound leaves."
