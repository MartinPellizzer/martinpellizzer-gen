It is characterized by its thorny stems, trifoliate leaves, and aggregate fruits composed of small, dark red to black berries. The plant thrives in moist, temperate climates and is often found in coastal areas and riparian zones. Its flowers are white or pale pink, and they appear in clusters during the spring. The fruit is edible, though some varieties may have a tart or astringent flavor."
