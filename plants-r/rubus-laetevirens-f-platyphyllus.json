    "intro": "Rubus laetevirens f. platyphyllus, commonly known as the broad-leaf raspberry, is a variant of the evergreen bramble characterized by its large, elliptical leaves. It is native to the mountainous regions of southern China and is known for its vigorous growth and thorny stems. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or orange when mature. Its foliage is dense and often used in traditional Chinese medicine. This form is distinguished by its broader leaves compared to the typical species, making it a notable cultivar in horticultural collections."
