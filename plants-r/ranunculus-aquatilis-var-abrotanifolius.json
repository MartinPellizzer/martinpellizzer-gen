    "intro": "Ranunculus aquatilis var. abrotanifolius, commonly known as the water crowfoot, is a aquatic plant characterized by its finely divided, trifoliate leaves that float on the water surface. It typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and lakes. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers with five petals, which bloom in early spring. Its roots are rhizomatous, allowing it to spread vegetatively and form dense colonies. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and fish."
