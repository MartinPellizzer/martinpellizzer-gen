It is native to parts of Asia and has been introduced to other regions for its edible berries. The plant typically grows as a shrub, reaching heights of up to 2 meters, with dark green, serrated leaves. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, and the fruit develops into a juicy, sweet-tart berry. The botanical features of Rubus \u00d7 melanothyrsus make it both an ornamental and a commercially valuable plant."
