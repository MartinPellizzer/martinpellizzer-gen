    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus subsp. platybasis, commonly known as the broadleaf buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features showy, yellow flowers with broad, palmately divided leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. Its flowers bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The subspecies is distinguished by its broader leaf blades compared to the typical form of *R. auricomus*."
