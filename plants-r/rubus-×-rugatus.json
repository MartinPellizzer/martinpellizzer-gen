    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 rugatus, commonly known as the blackberry raspberry, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between a blackberry (Rubus fruticosus) and a raspberry (Rubus idaeus). It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves, typical of the Rubus genus. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or black in color, depending on the variety. It thrives in temperate climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits a range of traits from both parent species, making it a popular choice for cultivation in gardens and for commercial fruit production."
