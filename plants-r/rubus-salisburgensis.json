    "intro": "Rubus salisburgensis, commonly known as the Salzburg raspberry, is a species of bramble native to Central Europe. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and produces small, edible berries that are typically red when ripe. The plant has compound leaves with serrated edges and produces white to pale pink flowers in the spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along streambanks. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
