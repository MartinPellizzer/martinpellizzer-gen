It is a shrub that produces small, dark purple berries that are often used in local cuisines. The plant has compound leaves with serrated edges and thorny stems typical of the Rubus genus. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodland edges and hedgerows. The flowers are white and appear in the spring, followed by the development of its characteristic berries."
