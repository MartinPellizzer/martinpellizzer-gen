    "intro": "Rubus strigosus var. borealis, commonly known as the Arctic bramble, is a shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America and Europe. It is characterized by its small, prickly stems and dark green, leathery leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in the summer, followed by red, juicy berries that are an important food source for birds and small mammals. It thrives in harsh, cold environments and is adapted to grow in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its limited range and specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
