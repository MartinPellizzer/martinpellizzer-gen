    "intro": "Rinorea subintegrifolia, commonly known as the white-flowered rinorea, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its simple, opposite, and often hairy leaves that are elliptical to ovate in shape. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on short pedicels. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that contain several seeds. Rinorea subintegrifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate foliage and flowering habit."
