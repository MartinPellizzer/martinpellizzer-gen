    "intro": "Ranunculus henriquesii, commonly known as the Henriques' buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It features delicate, showy flowers with five to nine yellow petals and a prominent central pistil, typically blooming in spring. The plant has a basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves that are hairy and covered in fine glands. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in its native range."
