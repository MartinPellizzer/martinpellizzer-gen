    "intro": "Ruellia adhaerens, commonly known as the creeping ruellia, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It features opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are usually hairy and have a distinct reddish or purple underside. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically blue or purple, blooming throughout the growing season. Ruellia adhaerens is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its rapid growth and spreading habit make it both a useful ground cover and a potential weed in certain areas."
