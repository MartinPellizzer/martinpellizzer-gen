    "intro": "Rosa abietina var. sancti-martinii, commonly known as the San Martin's rose, is a rare and delicate shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, clustered flowers that range from white to pale pink. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing fragrant, semi-double petals. Its leaves are dark green, glossy, and arranged in an alternate pattern along the stems. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a botanically significant and endangered species."
