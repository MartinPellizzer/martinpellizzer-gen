    "intro": "Rubus insularis, commonly known as the island blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and produces small, dark berries that are typically edible. The plant has trifoliate leaves and thorny stems, typical of the Rubus genus. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed areas. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species in certain regions."
