    "intro": "Ranunculus \u00d7 valesiacus, commonly known as the Valesiacean buttercup, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Ranunculus ficifolius and Ranunculus sceleratus. It is a herbaceous perennial with showy, cup-shaped flowers that typically range in color from yellow to orange. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It is native to Central Europe and is often found in wet meadows and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens but requires specific conditions to flourish."
