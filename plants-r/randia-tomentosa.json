    "intro": "Randia tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly randia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, often with a slight fragrance. Its leaves are typically ovate to elliptical in shape and may have a waxy texture. Randia tomentosa is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests or along stream banks."
