    "intro": "Rhipsalis cribrata, commonly known as the lace cactus, is a species of epiphytic cactus native to Brazil. It features a branched, trailing stem covered with small, translucent, waxy tubercles. The plant produces clusters of white or pale green flowers that bloom during the rainy season. Its leaves are reduced to small, hair-like structures, and it lacks true leaves. Rhipsalis cribrata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and ability to thrive in humid environments."
