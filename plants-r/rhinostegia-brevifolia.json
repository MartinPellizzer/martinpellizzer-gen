    "intro": "Rhinostegia brevifolia, commonly known as the short-leaved rhinostegia, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant features small, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its flowers are typically pale blue or purple, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Rhinostegia brevifolia is adapted to survive in low-nutrient soils and can withstand periods of drought."
