It is a shrub that typically grows in rocky and high-altitude environments, often in the Andes. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are usually red or yellow in color, with a distinctive, slightly acidic flavor. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the plant has thorny stems typical of the Rubus genus. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
