It belongs to the Restionaceae family and is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in coastal and sandy environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often clustered in spike-like inflorescences. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental appearance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its drought tolerance and unique foliage."
