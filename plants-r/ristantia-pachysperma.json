    "intro": "Ristantia pachysperma, commonly known as the broad-seeded watergrass, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its seeds are encased in a fleshy, thickened pericarp, which aids in dispersal by water. Ristantia pachysperma is often found in wetland habitats and can tolerate fluctuating water levels."
