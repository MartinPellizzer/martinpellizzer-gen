    "intro": "Ranunculus pumilio var. pilulifer, commonly known as the alpine buttercup, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features small, delicate yellow flowers with 5 to 15 petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has a basal rosette of hairy, lance-shaped leaves that help it retain moisture in cold, high-altitude environments. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in meadows and mountain slopes. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to harsh alpine conditions."
