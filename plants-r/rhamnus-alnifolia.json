    "intro": "Rhamnus alnifolia, commonly known as the alderleaf buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the northern regions of the United States and Canada. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 3 to 5 lobed, and its small, dark red berries that are an important food source for birds and mammals. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in streamside habitats and forest edges. It has been historically used in traditional medicine for its astringent properties."
