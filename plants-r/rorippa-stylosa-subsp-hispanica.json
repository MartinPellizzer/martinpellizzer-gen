    "intro": "Rorippa stylosa subsp. hispanica, commonly known as Spanish watercress, is a flowering plant in the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, heart-shaped leaves that are typically submerged or floating in water. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, contributing to its ornamental value. It thrives in wetland environments and is often found in shallow water or along the edges of ponds and streams. This subspecies is valued for its edible leaves, which have a peppery flavor similar to watercress."
