    "intro": "Rosa glauca var. serrata, commonly known as the serrated blue rose, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, serrated leaves and produces pale blue to lavender flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique color and fragrance. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, thriving in cooler climates. Due to its limited natural range, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species in the wild."
