    "intro": "Rhipidoglossum polyanthum, commonly known as the clustered tongue grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Africa. It features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences that are typically pale green to white in color. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in sandy or rocky soils. It has a fibrous root system that helps it retain moisture in dry conditions. Its flowers are primarily wind-pollinated, and it is often used in traditional medicine in its native regions."
