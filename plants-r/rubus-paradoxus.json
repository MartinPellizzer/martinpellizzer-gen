    "intro": "Rubus paradoxus, commonly known as the paradoxical raspberry, is a species of bramble native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its thorny stems and aggregate fruits, which are typically red or yellow when ripe. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by the development of its edible berries. It thrives in moist, woodland environments and is often found in shaded areas with well-drained soil. The botanical features of Rubus paradoxus make it an important plant for both ecological studies and local biodiversity."
