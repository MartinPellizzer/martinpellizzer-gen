It is characterized by its morphological variation in leaf shape and size, which can range from elliptical to ovate. This form is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and streambanks. The plant produces small, black berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Its presence in certain ecosystems can indicate specific soil and moisture conditions."
