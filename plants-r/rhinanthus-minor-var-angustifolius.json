    "intro": "Rhinanthus minor var. angustifolius, commonly known as narrow-leaved yellow rattle, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients while also performing photosynthesis. Its slender, angular stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves distinguish it from other species in the genus. It often grows in grasslands and meadows, contributing to biodiversity by supporting pollinators and other wildlife."
