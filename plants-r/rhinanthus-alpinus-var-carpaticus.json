    "intro": "Rhinanthus alpinus var. carpaticus, commonly known as the Carpathian yellowtop, is a flowering plant native to the Carpathian Mountains. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from the roots of other plants. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and forest clearings. Its flowers are tubular and attract various pollinators, including bees and flies."
