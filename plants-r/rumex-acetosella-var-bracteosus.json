    "intro": "Rumex acetosella var. bracteosus, commonly known as the bracted sorrel, is a variant of the common sorrel plant. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its distinctive heart-shaped leaves and reddish stems. The plant typically thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodland or heathland environments. Its flowers are small and clustered, producing a yellowish-green color, and it is known for its edible leaves, though they are somewhat tart. This variant is notable for its unique bract-like structures that surround the flower clusters, distinguishing it from other forms of sorrel."
