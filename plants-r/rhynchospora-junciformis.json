It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, rushes, and grass-like plants. The plant typically grows in marshes, bogs, and other moist environments, often forming dense colonies. Its slender, grass-like stems are usually less than 30 cm tall, with small, triangular leaves. The flowers are arranged in spikelets, and the plant plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
