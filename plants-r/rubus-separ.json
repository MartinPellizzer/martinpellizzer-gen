    "intro": "Rubus separ, commonly known as the trailing blackberry, is a species of bramble native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and thorny stems, which help it to climb and spread across ground surfaces. The plant produces small, dark berries that are typically edible, though they may vary in taste depending on the specific variety. Its leaves are typically trifoliate, with three leaflets that are serrated along the edges. The trailing blackberry is often found in woodland edges, hedgerows, and other disturbed habitats where it can thrive in partial shade."
