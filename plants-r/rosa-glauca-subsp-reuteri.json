    "intro": "Rosa glauca subsp. reuteri, commonly known as the alpine rose, is a species of flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces showy, pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white, waxy hair, which helps reduce water loss in its alpine habitat. It is often found in rocky soils and open meadows at high elevations. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and beauty."
