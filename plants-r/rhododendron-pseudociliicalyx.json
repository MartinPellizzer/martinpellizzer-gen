    "intro": "Rhododendron pseudociliicalyx, commonly known as the Guangxi rhododendron, is a species native to southern China, particularly Guangxi Province. It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and elliptical in shape. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
