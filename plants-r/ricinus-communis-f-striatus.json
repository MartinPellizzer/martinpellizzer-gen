    "intro": "Ricinus communis f. striatus, commonly known as the striped castor bean, is a variant of the castor oil plant characterized by its distinctive leaf patterns. The leaves are typically broad, palmately lobed, and feature prominent white or pale green stripes along the veins. This ornamental plant is native to tropical regions and thrives in warm, humid climates. It produces spiny capsules containing toxic seeds, which are used in traditional medicine and as a source of castor oil. Due to its striking appearance, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in gardens and greenhouses."
