    "intro": "Rubus tereticaulis subsp. subalpinus, commonly known as the alpine blackberry, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, thorny stems and small, dark red to black berries that ripen in late summer. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it produces white to pale pink flowers in early summer. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its edible fruits."
