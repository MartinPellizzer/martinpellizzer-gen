    "intro": "Roegneria sirouana, commonly known as the Sirouan's wheatgrass, is a grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, cylindrical stems that often form dense clumps. The plant produces spikelets that are typically arranged in a compact panicle, with each spikelet containing several small, awned lemmas. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration that becomes more pronounced in cooler climates. Roegneria sirouana is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage and resilience to harsh environmental conditions."
