It is characterized by its slender, often thornless stems and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces oval, reddish-brown hips that are edible and contain seeds. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a finely toothed margin. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and compact growth habit."
