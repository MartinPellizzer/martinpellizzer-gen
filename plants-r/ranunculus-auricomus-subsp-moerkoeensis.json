It typically grows in moist, nutrient-poor soils in tundra and alpine environments. The plant features delicate, palmately divided leaves and yellow flowers with prominent, showy petals. It is adapted to cold climates and has a short growing season. Its botanical characteristics reflect its evolutionary response to harsh, high-latitude habitats."
