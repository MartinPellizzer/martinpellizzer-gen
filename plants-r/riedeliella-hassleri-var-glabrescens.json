    "intro": "Riedeliella hassleri var. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth-leaved riedeliella, is a rare and specialized plant species belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, glabrous leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in rocky or forested areas. Its flowers are small and clustered, usually appearing in late spring to early summer. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
