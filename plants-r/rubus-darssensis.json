    "intro": "Rubus darssensis, commonly known as the Dartsman blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black in color. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and partial shade. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and lesser-known member of the Rubus genus."
