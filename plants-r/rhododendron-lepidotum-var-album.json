    "intro": "Rhododendron lepidotum var. album, commonly known as the white-flowered lepidotum rhododendron, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It features dense, leathery leaves that are dark green and glossy, providing a striking contrast to its showy white flowers. The blooms are typically clustered in trusses and appear in early spring, adding ornamental value to gardens. This variety is well-suited for shaded areas and thrives in moist, well-drained soil. Its botanical characteristics make it a desirable plant for both landscape design and botanical study."
