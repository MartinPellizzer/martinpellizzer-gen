    "intro": "Rosa nutkana var. setosa, commonly known as the alpine rose, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and dense clusters of fragrant pink to white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has finely toothed, dark green leaves that are covered in a soft, woolly layer of hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in cooler climates."
