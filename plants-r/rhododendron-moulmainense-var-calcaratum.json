    "intro": "Rhododendron moulmainense var. calcaratum, commonly known as the Moulmain rock rhododendron, is a rare and striking evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pale pink to deep red. The plant thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its unique habitat and limited distribution make it a valuable species for botanical study and conservation efforts. This variety is distinguished by its distinctive calcarate (bony) projections on the stems, which give it its specific epithet."
