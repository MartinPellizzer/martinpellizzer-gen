It is characterized by its showy, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils and thrives in partial to full shade. Its leaves are dark green and elliptical, providing a striking contrast to its delicate flowers. Rhododendron candidum is often found in woodlands and along stream banks, where it plays an important role in local ecosystems."
