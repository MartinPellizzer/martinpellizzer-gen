    "intro": "Rubus hypomalacus var. acanthothyrsus, commonly known as the thorned blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to parts of South America. It is characterized by its prickly stems and thorny bracts, which distinguish it from other Rubus species. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically edible. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in shaded, moist environments. Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and horticultural contexts."
