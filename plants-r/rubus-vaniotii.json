    "intro": "Rubus vaniotii, commonly known as the Vanioti raspberry, is a species of bramble native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves, typical of the Rubus genus. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or yellow in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
