    "intro": "Rubus luteistylus var. anomalus, commonly known as the yellow-styled raspberry, is a variant of the raspberry species native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its yellowish stigmas, which distinguish it from other Rubus species. The plant produces aggregate fruits composed of small, red drupelets that ripen in the summer. It thrives in moist, temperate climates and is often found in forest understories. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for taxonomic study and horticultural cultivation."
