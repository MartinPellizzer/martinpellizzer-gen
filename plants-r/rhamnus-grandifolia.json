    "intro": "Rhamnus grandifolia, commonly known as the largeleaf buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It typically grows to a height of 6 to 15 feet and features opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, which are followed by dark blue berries that are edible for birds. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, often exuding a sticky substance when cut. Rhamnus grandifolia is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks."
