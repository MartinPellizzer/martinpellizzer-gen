It is a variant of the blackberry plant characterized by its reduced glandular structures on the stems and leaves compared to the typical Rubus glandulosus. The plant produces dark purple to black berries that are typically smaller than those of other blackberry varieties. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for horticultural and ecological studies."
