    "intro": "Rubus vestitus subvar. gizellae, commonly known as the white-flowered bramble, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, thorny stems and small, white flowers that bloom in early summer. The leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the plant produces edible, though tart, red berries in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or alpine habitats. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
