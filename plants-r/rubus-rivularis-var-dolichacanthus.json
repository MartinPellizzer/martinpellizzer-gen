    "intro": "Rubus rivularis var. dolichacanthus, commonly known as the long-sting bramble, is a shrub native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of white to pale pink flowers. The leaves are typically trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the plant produces small, edible berries that are often used in local cuisines. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found along riverbanks and woodland edges. This variant is distinguished by its longer, more pronounced thorns compared to other Rubus species."
