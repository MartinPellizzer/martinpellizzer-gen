    "intro": "Ranunculus villarsii subsp. baidarae, commonly known as the Baidara buttercup, is a rare and striking member of the Ranunculaceae family. It is native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas, particularly in Nepal and northern India. The plant features showy, yellow flowers with five petals and numerous stamens, typical of the genus Ranunculus. Its leaves are palmately divided, and the plant thrives in cool, moist environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
