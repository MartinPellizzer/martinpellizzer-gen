    "intro": "Rhododendron lepidotum subsp. salignum, commonly known as the Alpine Rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense foliage, which helps it withstand harsh alpine conditions. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to purple, often blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in specialized gardens and conservation efforts."
