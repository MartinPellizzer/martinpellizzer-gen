    "intro": "Ranunculus polii, commonly known as the Alpine buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its showy, yellow flowers with five to seven petals. The plant typically grows in rocky or grassy habitats at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are palmately divided and covered in fine hairs, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Ranunculus polii is often found in mountainous areas of the Alps and the Carpathians."
