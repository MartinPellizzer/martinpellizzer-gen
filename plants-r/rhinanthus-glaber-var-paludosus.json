    "intro": "Rhinanthus glaber var. paludosus, commonly known as the marsh yellowtop, is a variant of the yellowtop plant native to wetland habitats. It is a herbaceous annual plant characterized by its yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in damp, nutrient-rich soils, often found in marshes, fens, and along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are narrow and linear, and the stems are erect, often reaching heights of up to 60 centimeters. This variant is notable for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its adaptation to wetland environments."
