It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage with elliptical leaves that are often spirally arranged along the stems. The plant produces showy clusters of bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to red, typically blooming in late spring. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and requires partial to full shade for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is often cultivated in gardens and natural habitats."
