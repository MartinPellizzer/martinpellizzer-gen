It features compound leaves with three distinct lobes, giving it its common name, and produces small, clustered yellowish-green flowers in the spring. The plant is notable for its bright red, fuzzy fruit clusters that appear in the fall, providing food for wildlife. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is adaptable to various soil types. Its ornamental value and ecological benefits make it a popular choice for native plant gardens."
