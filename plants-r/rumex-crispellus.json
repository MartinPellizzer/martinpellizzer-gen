    "intro": "Rumex crispellus, commonly known as narrowleaf dock, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features upright, slender stems that are often reddish in color and covered with fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in dense clusters during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are lance-shaped, serrated, and have a slightly wavy margin, giving it a distinctive appearance. Rumex crispellus is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in meadows, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade."
