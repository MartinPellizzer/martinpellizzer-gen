    "intro": "Rubus lebelianus, commonly known as the Lebelian blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and the production of small, dark purple to black berries. The plant has trifoliate leaves with serrated edges and produces white to pale pink flowers in the spring. Its berries are typically edible, though they are not as widely cultivated as other blackberry varieties. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas."
