    "intro": "Rhus tenuipes, commonly known as the slender-leafed sumac, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically divided into narrow, elongated leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by red, fuzzy fruits that are a common food source for birds. Rhus tenuipes thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or stream banks. Its botanical features make it an important component of native plant communities and a valuable species for ecological restoration."
