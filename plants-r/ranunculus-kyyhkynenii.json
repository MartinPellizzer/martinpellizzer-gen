It is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its bright yellow, showy flowers with five to seven petals. The plant has palmately divided leaves that are typically hairy and have a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
