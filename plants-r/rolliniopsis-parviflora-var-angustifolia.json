It is a member of the Verbenaceae family, characterized by its small, clustered flowers and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in disturbed or open habitats. Its narrow, lance-shaped leaves are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The species is known for its resilience to drought and its ability to thrive in low-nutrient soils."
