    "intro": "Rosa canina var. subvillosa, commonly known as the bristly dog rose, is a variant of the dog rose species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance compared to other Rosa canina varieties. The flowers are typically pink or white, with five petals and numerous stamens, and they bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces red, berry-like fruits called hips, which are rich in vitamin C and used in traditional medicine. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in hedgerows and woodland edges."
