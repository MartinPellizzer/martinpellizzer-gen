    "intro": "Rosa glauca var. fallax, commonly known as the alpine rose or fallax rose, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dark green, slightly hairy leaves. The plant produces fragrant, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in late summer. It is adapted to harsh alpine conditions, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with similar environmental conditions."
