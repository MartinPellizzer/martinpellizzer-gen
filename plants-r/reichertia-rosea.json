    "intro": "Reichertia rosea, commonly known as the pink sandalwood, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted branches and small, elliptical leaves that are glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers with pinkish hues, typically in spring, which are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. Reichertia rosea is well adapted to sandy soils and saline environments, making it a hardy plant in coastal areas. Its unique appearance and ecological significance make it an important species in its native habitat."
