    "intro": "Rhamnus cathartica var. sylvatica, commonly known as the European buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features dark green, oval-shaped leaves that turn reddish in autumn, and it produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring. The plant is notable for its dark, purplish-black berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds. Its bark is thick and fissured, and it often grows in woodland edges or along riverbanks. This species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in dye production."
