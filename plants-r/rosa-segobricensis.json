    "intro": "Rosa segobricensis, commonly known as the Segobric Mountain rose, is a rare species native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and large, fragrant pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces hips that are red and edible. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Rosa segobricensis is considered a species of conservation concern."
