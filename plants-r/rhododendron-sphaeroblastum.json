    "intro": "Rhododendron sphaeroblastum, commonly known as the spherical-leaved rhododendron, is a rare and unique species native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its distinctive, rounded, leathery leaves that are densely covered with fine, appressed hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to white, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in cool, humid climates with well-drained, acidic soils. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a valuable but endangered species in its native range."
