    "intro": "Rebutia deminuta subsp. kupperiana, commonly known as the Kupper's moon cactus, is a compact, low-growing succulent native to South America. It features a short, thick stem with a single, fleshy, globular body that typically measures no more than 2 inches in diameter. The plant produces vibrant, showy flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are usually small, rounded, and covered in a fine, white powdery coating called bloom. This species is well-suited for rock gardens and containers due to its drought tolerance and ease of care."
