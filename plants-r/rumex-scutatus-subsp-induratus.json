    "intro": "Rumex scutatus subsp. induratus, commonly known as the rough dock, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its thick, ribbed, and often hairy stems, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. The leaves are typically broad, lance-shaped, and have a waxy coating, which reduces water loss. It produces small, greenish flowers in dense clusters, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. This plant is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in open fields."
