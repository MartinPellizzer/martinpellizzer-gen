    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 trachyadenoides, commonly known as the blackberry raspberry, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Rubus ursinus (the raspberry) and Rubus chamaemorus (the cloudberry). It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark red to black in color, with a tart and slightly sweet flavor. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is cultivated in gardens and agricultural settings."
