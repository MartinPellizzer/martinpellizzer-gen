It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or yellow in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within the Rubus genus."
