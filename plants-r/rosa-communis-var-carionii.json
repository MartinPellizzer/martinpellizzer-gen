    "intro": "Rosa communis var. carionii, commonly known as the Carionii rose, is a botanical variant of the common rose, characterized by its unique floral morphology and fragrance. It typically features semi-double to fully double pink to red flowers, with a subtle, sweet aroma that is particularly noticeable in cooler weather. The plant is a deciduous shrub, growing to a height of approximately 1 to 2 meters, with thorny stems and dark green, serrated leaves. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Due to its specific genetic traits, it is relatively rare and often cultivated for its aesthetic and olfactory qualities."
