    "intro": "Rosa canina var. urticifolia, commonly known as the stinging rose, is a variant of the dog rose. It is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia, characterized by its thorny stems and fragrant pink or white flowers. The leaves are pinnate, with serrated edges, and the plant produces red, hairy fruits known as hip fruits. It is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in woodland edges and hedgerows. The plant is notable for its defensive stinging hairs on the stems and leaves, which deter herbivores."
