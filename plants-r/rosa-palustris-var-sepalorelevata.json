    "intro": "Rosa palustris var. sepalorelevata, commonly known as the elevated-sepaled swamp rose, is a variant of the swamp rose native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of fragrant, pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture, adapted to thrive in moist, often acidic soils. Its sepals are notably elevated, giving it a distinctive appearance compared to other Rosa species. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological role in supporting pollinators in wetland ecosystems."
