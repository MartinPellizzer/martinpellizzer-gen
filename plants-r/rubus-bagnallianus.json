    "intro": "Rubus bagnallianus, commonly known as Bagnall's blackberry, is a species of brambles native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, dark red to black berries. The plant produces aggregate fruits composed of tiny achenes, typical of the Rubus genus. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas at higher elevations. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and lesser-known member of the Rubus family."
