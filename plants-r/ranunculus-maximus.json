    "intro": "Ranunculus maximus, commonly known as the giant buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the wetlands of Europe and parts of Asia. It features a robust, rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread aggressively in moist environments. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with numerous petals, often surrounded by a ring of sepals. Its leaves are palmately lobed and can grow quite large, sometimes reaching up to 30 cm in length. Ranunculus maximus is adapted to waterlogged soils and is often found in marshes, pond edges, and along riverbanks."
