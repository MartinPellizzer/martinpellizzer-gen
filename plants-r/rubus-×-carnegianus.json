    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 carnegianus, commonly known as the evergreen blackberry, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Rubus ursinus and Rubus pectoralis. It is native to coastal regions of California and is characterized by its dense, thorny growth habit. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically harvested in late summer. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often cultivated in coastal gardens and natural landscapes."
