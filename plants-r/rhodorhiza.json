    "intro": "Rhodorhiza, commonly known as the red root or red sandalwood, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Myrtaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia, and is characterized by its aromatic bark and roots. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with smooth, reddish-barked stems and lance-shaped leaves. Rhodorhiza species are valued for their medicinal properties and are often used in traditional medicine. However, many species are threatened due to overharvesting and habitat loss."
