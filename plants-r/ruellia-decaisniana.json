    "intro": "Ruellia decaisniana, commonly known as the Mexican bluebell, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue or violet tubular flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous perennial, reaching heights of up to 1 meter, with opposite, lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for gardeners in warmer climates.
