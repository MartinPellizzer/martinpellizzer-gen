    "intro": "Rosa dumalis f. laxifolia, commonly known as the looseleaf wild rose, is a flowering plant species native to parts of Asia and the Himalayas. It is characterized by its sprawling growth habit and fragrant pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are compound, typically consisting of 5 to 9 elliptical leaflets, and are often hairy beneath. The plant produces small, red, aggregate fruits called rose hips, which are an important food source for birds and small mammals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in forested or rocky habitats."
