    "intro": "Reboulea truncata, commonly known as the broad-leafed ironwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by woody fruits containing seeds. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its hard wood, it has historical significance in traditional carpentry and construction."
