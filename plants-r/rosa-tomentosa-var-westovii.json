    "intro": "Rosa tomentosa var. westovii, commonly known as the Westovii shrub rose, is a compact, thorny shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features dense, grayish-white fuzzy foliage and produces fragrant, semi-double pink flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant is characterized by its upright growth habit and is well-suited for rock gardens or as a hedge due to its hardy nature. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to a range of garden conditions."
