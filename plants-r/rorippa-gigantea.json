    "intro": "Rorippa gigantea, commonly known as the giant watercress, is a flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its rapid growth and ability to thrive in moist or aquatic environments. The plant features alternate, ovate leaves that are often submerged or floating, with small white flowers that appear in clusters. Its roots can form dense mats, which can alter the physical and chemical properties of water bodies. Rorippa gigantea is often considered an invasive species in non-native regions due to its competitive nature and ecological impact."
