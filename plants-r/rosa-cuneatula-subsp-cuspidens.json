    "intro": "Rosa cuneatula subsp. cuspidens, commonly known as the narrowleaf dogwood rose, is a species native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is a shrub-like plant characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, clustered flowers. The leaves are typically narrow and elliptical, with a pointed tip, giving it its scientific name. It produces pink to red flowers in late spring to early summer, followed by orange-red hips in the fall. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens for its compact growth and hardy nature."
