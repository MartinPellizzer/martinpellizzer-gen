    "intro": "Rubus langei var. parvifolius, commonly known as the small-leaved blackberry, is a variant of the Rubus genus native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its small, ovate leaves with a slightly serrated margin and a dense covering of fine hairs. The plant produces aggregate fruits, known as drupelets, which are typically dark purple to black when mature. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges and shaded areas. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and small-scale agriculture."
