It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks, where it thrives in moist to aquatic environments. Its morphology includes a dense, spike-like inflorescence with small, three-lobed flowers. Rhynchospora sartoriana is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support wetland biodiversity."
