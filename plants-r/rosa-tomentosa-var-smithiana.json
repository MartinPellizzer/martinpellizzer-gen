    "intro": "Rosa tomentosa var. smithiana, commonly known as the Smith's wooly rose, is a variant of the woolly rose species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, white to grayish pubescent foliage and stems, which give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The flowers are typically pink to red, with five to seven petals, and bloom in early summer. This plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often growing in rocky or alpine environments. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique texture and color."
