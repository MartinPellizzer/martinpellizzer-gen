    "intro": "Ranunculus clivicola, commonly known as the cliffrunner buttercup, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of western Asia. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found growing on cliffs, slopes, and along stream banks. The plant produces delicate, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to pink, depending on the specific variety. Its leaves are typically trifoliate, with three deeply lobed leaflets, and the plant is known for its ability to tolerate harsh alpine conditions. Ranunculus clivicola is an important component of alpine ecosystems, contributing to biodiversity and providing nectar for pollinators."
