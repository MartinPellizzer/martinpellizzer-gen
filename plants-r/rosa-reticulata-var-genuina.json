It is characterized by its fragrant, semi-double pink flowers that bloom continuously throughout the growing season. The plant has arching, thorned stems and dark green, ovate leaves with serrated edges. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a parent species in the development of many modern garden roses."
