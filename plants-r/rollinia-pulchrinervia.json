    "intro": "Rollinia pulchrinervia, commonly known as the showy rollinia, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, elliptical leaves with prominent veins, which give it its scientific name \"pulchrinervia,\" meaning \"beautiful vein.\" The plant produces clusters of yellowish-green flowers that are followed by edible, spiny fruits resembling small, round apples. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in lowland tropical forests. Due to its ornamental value and fruit production, it is cultivated in some regions for both aesthetic and agricultural purposes."
