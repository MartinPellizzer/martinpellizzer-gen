These plants are characterized by their tall, upright stems and clusters of showy, usually purple or pink flowers. Ruthea species are native to temperate regions of Europe, Asia, and North America. They typically grow in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The leaves are compound, with deeply lobed or divided foliage that adds to the plant's ornamental appeal."
