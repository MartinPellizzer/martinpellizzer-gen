It is characterized by its slender, trailing stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically edible. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three leaflets that are serrated along the edges. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas."
