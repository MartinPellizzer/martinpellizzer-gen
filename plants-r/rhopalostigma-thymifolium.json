    "intro": "Rhopalostigma thymifolium, commonly known as the thyme-leaved rockrose, is a perennial shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, small, needle-like leaves that resemble those of thyme, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in dry, sunny habitats. Rhopalostigma thymifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in rock gardens or as a ground cover."
