    "intro": "Rumex scutatus var. aetnensis, commonly known as the Etna dock, is a perennial herb native to the volcanic regions of Sicily. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, reddish-tinged leaves and a flowering stem that bears small, greenish flowers. The plant thrives in rocky, nutrient-poor soils and is adapted to the harsh conditions of volcanic landscapes. Its leaves are often used in local traditional medicine for their astringent properties. The species is notable for its ability to colonize and stabilize slopes in its native environment."
