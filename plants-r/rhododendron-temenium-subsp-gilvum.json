    "intro": "Rhododendron temenium subsp. gilvum, commonly known as the golden-leaved rhododendron, is a subshrub native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage that turns a striking golden hue during the autumn season. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, pink to reddish flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and requires partial to full shade for optimal growth. This species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in cooler, humid climates."
