    "intro": "Ranunculus montanus var. tenuifolius, commonly known as the slender-leaved crowfoot, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, palmate leaves and showy, yellow or white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils along stream banks and in meadows. It is a member of the Ranunculaceae family, known for its often toxic sap. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though care must be taken due to its poisonous properties."
