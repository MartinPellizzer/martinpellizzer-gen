    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 philyrophyllus, commonly known as the evergreen blackberry, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Rubus ursinus and Rubus pectoralis. It is characterized by its dense, thorny bushes and dark green, leathery leaves that remain on the plant throughout the year. The plant produces small, dark red berries that are typically consumed fresh or used in jams and preserves. It thrives in temperate climates and prefers well-drained soil with partial to full sun exposure. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is often cultivated in gardens and for commercial use."
