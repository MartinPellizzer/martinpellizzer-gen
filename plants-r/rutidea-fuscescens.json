    "intro": "Rutidea fuscescens, commonly known as the purple leaf legume, is a species native to South America. It is a perennial shrub that belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its woody stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pink to purple, followed by pod fruits containing several seeds. Rutidea fuscescens is adapted to grow in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it ecologically significant in nutrient-poor soils."
