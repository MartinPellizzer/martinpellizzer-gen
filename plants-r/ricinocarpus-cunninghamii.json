It is a dioecious plant, meaning it has separate male and female individuals. The plant produces large, palm-like leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. Its cones, which are the reproductive structures, are typically borne on separate stems. This species is native to Australia and is adapted to grow in dry, sandy soils."
