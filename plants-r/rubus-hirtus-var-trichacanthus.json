    "intro": "Rubus hirtus var. trichacanthus, commonly known as the prickly blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant characterized by its thorny stems and dark purple to black fruits. It is native to the eastern United States and thrives in moist, wooded areas. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically harvested when fully ripe. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the plant is often found in shaded, humid environments. The berries are edible but have a tart flavor, making them suitable for jams and pies."
