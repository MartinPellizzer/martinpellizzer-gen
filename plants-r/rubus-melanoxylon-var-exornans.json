    "intro": "Rubus melanoxylon var. exornans, commonly known as the velvetleaf blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark foliage and thorny stems, which are typical features of the Rubus genus. The leaves are usually elliptical with a velvety texture, contributing to its common name. The plant produces small, dark berries that are edible but often have a tart flavor. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
