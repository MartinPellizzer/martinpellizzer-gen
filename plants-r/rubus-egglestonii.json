    "intro": "Rubus egglestonii, commonly known as Eggleston's blackberry, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is native to the western United States, particularly found in California and Oregon. The plant is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves, typical of many Rubus species. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, and it produces edible berries that are similar to other blackberry varieties. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
