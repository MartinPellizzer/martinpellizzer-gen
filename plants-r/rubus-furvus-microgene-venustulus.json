    "intro": "Rubus furvus microgene venustulus, commonly known as the beautiful tiniest raspberry, is a rare and delicate species within the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its small, hairy leaves and clusters of tiny, edible berries that ripen to a deep red color. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and stream sides. Its flowers are white with five petals and are often visited by pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
