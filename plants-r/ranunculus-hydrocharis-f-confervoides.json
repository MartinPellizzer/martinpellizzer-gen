It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is native to freshwater environments in temperate regions. The plant typically grows in shallow waters, such as ponds and slow-moving streams, where it can anchor itself with its rhizomes. Its flowers are usually yellow or white, with five petals and numerous stamens, and it blooms in early spring. This variety is distinguished by its leaf structure and is often used in ornamental water gardens."
