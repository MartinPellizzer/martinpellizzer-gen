    "intro": "Rohdea wattii, commonly known as the Chinese sword fern, is a perennial herb native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Zingiberaceae, which includes gingers, and is characterized by its sword-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Rohdea wattii is valued for its ornamental foliage and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
