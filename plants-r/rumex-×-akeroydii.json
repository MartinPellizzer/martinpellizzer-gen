It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its distinctive arrowhead-shaped leaves and reddish veins. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Its flowers are small and clustered in loose spikes, and it produces capsule fruits that contain several seeds.
