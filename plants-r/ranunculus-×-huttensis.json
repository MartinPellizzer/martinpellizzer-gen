    "intro": "Ranunculus \u00d7 huttensis, commonly known as the Hutt's buttercup, is a hybrid perennial plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its showy, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along streambanks. Its leaves are palmately lobed, and it produces small, hairy fruits that disperse its seeds by wind. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is more commonly found in its natural habitat."
