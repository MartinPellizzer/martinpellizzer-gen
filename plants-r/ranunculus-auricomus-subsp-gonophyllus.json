    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus subsp. gonophyllus, commonly known as the golden shield buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It features distinctive yellow flowers with five broadly ovate petals that resemble shields, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks. Its leaves are palmately lobed and have a hairy texture, while the stems are usually unbranched and somewhat succulent. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its bright, cheerful blooms."
