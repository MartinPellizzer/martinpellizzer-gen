It features heart-shaped, waxy leaves and produces striking, funnel-shaped flowers that range from white to pink. The plant is notable for its ability to thrive in arid conditions, making it drought-tolerant. Its flowers emit a sweet fragrance, attracting pollinators like bees and hummingbirds. However, it is important to note that all parts of the plant are toxic if ingested."
