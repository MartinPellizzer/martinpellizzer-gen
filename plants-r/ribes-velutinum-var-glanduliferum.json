    "intro": "Ribes velutinum var. glanduliferum, commonly known as the glandular gooseberry, is a shrub native to western North America. It is characterized by its hairy, reddish stems and oval, dark green leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are followed by edible, yellow berries that ripen in late summer. Its leaves and stems are covered in glandular hairs, which secrete a sticky substance. This variety is often found in moist, forested areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal and wildlife habitat."
