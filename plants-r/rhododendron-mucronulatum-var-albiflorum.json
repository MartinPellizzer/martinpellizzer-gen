    "intro": "Rhododendron mucronulatum var. albiflorum, commonly known as the White-flowered Knapweed Rhododendron, is a compact evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of China. It features dense, dark green foliage and produces clusters of fragrant, white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and is typically found in shaded, moist woodland environments. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate floral display. This variety is closely related to other rhododendron species but is distinguished by its unique white blossoms and compact growth habit."
