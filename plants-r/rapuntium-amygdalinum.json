    "intro": "Rapuntium amygdalinum, commonly known as the bitter almond plant, is a shrub native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves and clusters of white or pinkish flowers. The plant produces small, edible fruits that contain a high concentration of amygdalin, a compound related to cyanide. Due to its toxic potential, it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings. Its botanical features make it both a subject of botanical study and a cautionary example in plant toxicity."
