    "intro": "Rubus serpens microgene heterophylloides, commonly known as the variable leaf raspberry, is a species within the Rubus genus characterized by its unique morphological variation. It exhibits heterophylly, a trait where plants produce leaves of different shapes and sizes on the same individual, often in response to environmental conditions. The plant is typically shrub-like, with thorny stems and compound leaves that vary in structure depending on light exposure. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, and it produces small, aggregate fruits known as drupes. This species is often found in moist, shaded habitats and is of interest to botanists due to its adaptive leaf morphology."
