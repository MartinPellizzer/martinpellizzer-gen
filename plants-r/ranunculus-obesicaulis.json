    "intro": "Ranunculus obesicaulis, commonly known as the fat-stemmed buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to western North America. It features a distinctive, swollen, often reddish stem that gives it its common name. The plant produces showy, cup-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, white, or pink, typically with 5 to 15 petals. Its leaves are deeply lobed and arranged in a basal rosette, and it thrives in moist, shady environments. Ranunculus obesicaulis is often found in meadows, streambanks, and woodland edges."
