    "intro": "Rosa lucieae var. yokoscensis, commonly known as the Yokosuka rose, is a rare and distinctive variety of wild rose native to Japan. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, fragrant pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has narrow, elliptical leaves with a slightly hairy texture, and its stems are covered in fine, reddish-brown thorns. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight. Due to its limited distribution and unique appearance, it is considered a valuable species in botanical studies and conservation efforts."
