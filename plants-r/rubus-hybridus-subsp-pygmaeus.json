    "intro": "Rubus hybridus subsp. pygmaeus, commonly known as the dwarf blackberry, is a shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its small, thorny stems and trifoliate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically less than 1 cm in diameter. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited range and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
