    "intro": "Rhododendron weldianum, commonly known as the Weldian rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of eastern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in shady, moist habitats, often in forest understories or along stream banks. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, providing a striking contrast to its vibrant blooms. Rhododendron weldianum is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its native ecosystems."
