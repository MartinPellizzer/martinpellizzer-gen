    "intro": "Rosa leucadia, commonly known as the white sand rose, is a species of flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, featuring woody stems and small, narrow leaves. The plant produces showy, single flowers that are usually white or pale pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. Rosa leucadia is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures, making it a hardy plant in harsh climates. Its botanical characteristics make it an interesting subject for study in xerophytic plant adaptations."
