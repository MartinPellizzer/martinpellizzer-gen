It features dense, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and elliptical in shape. The plant produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It prefers acidic, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and seasonal color changes."
