    "intro": "Rhodamnia arenaria, commonly known as the sand dune hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in dune environments. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are usually pink or red, attracting pollinators such as birds and insects. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Rhodamnia arenaria is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes."
