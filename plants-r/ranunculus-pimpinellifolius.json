    "intro": "Ranunculus pimpinellifolius, commonly known as the common buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It features striking, showy yellow flowers with numerous petals that resemble those of a true buttercup. The plant has deeply lobed, trifoliate leaves that are often hairy and covered in fine, glandular dots. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, along streambanks, and in woodland edges. The plant is also known for its toxic sap, which can cause skin irritation."
