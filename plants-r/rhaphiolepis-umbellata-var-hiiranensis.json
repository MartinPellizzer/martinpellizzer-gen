    "intro": "Rhaphiolepis umbellata var. hiiranensis, commonly known as the Hiiranensis rosebay, is a flowering shrub native to parts of East Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and is often used as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. The plant produces showy clusters of pink to red flowers in the summer, which are borne on terminal umbels. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with a glossy surface, and it thrives in well-drained soil and full sun. It is relatively drought-tolerant once established, making it suitable for xeriscaping in arid regions."
