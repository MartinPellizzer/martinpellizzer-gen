It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. Its yellow-orange flowers bloom in the spring and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Remijia hirsuta is often found in grasslands and disturbed soils, thriving in full sun."
