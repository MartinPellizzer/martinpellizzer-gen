    "intro": "Rosa uriensis var. heerii, commonly known as the Heer's evergreen rose, is a rare and unique variant of the evergreen rose species. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage that remains green throughout the year, distinguishing it from other rose varieties. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white, typically blooming in late spring. Native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, it thrives in cool, humid climates with well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a valuable and somewhat elusive species in botanical collections."
