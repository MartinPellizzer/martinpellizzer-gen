    "intro": "Rosa glauca var. complicata, commonly known as the blue rose or blue shrub rose, is a compact, deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its dark green, slightly hairy foliage and its striking, deep blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, red-orange hips in the fall, which are edible and contain seeds. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained, alkaline soils. Due to its ornamental value and unique color, it is often cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
