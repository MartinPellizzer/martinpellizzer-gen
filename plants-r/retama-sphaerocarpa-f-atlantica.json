    "intro": "Retama sphaerocarpa f. atlantica, commonly known as the Atlantic retama, is a shrub native to the Iberian Peninsula and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its dense, spherical clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has small, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine pubescence, aiding in water retention. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to Mediterranean climates. This variety is notable for its ornamental value and its ability to stabilize soil in arid environments."
