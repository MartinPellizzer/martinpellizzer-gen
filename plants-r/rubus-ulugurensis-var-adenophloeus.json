It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, dark berries that are typically edible, though they may have a tart flavor. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forested areas. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both horticultural study and ecological research."
