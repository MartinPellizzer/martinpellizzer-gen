    "intro": "Rhododendron chrysolepis, commonly known as the golden alpine rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of showy, funnel-shaped flowers that range from white to pink or yellow. The plant typically grows in high elevation habitats, such as alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, providing a striking contrast to its vibrant floral displays. Rhododendron chrysolepis is well adapted to harsh climates and plays an important role in stabilizing soil in its native environment."
