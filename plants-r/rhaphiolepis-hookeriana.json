    "intro": "Rhaphiolepis hookeriana, commonly known as the Hooker's boxwood, is a shrub native to Japan. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage that consists of small, oval-shaped leaves with a leathery texture. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Due to its compact growth habit, it is often used as a hedge or in rock gardens."
