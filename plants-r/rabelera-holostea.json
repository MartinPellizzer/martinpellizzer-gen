It features lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery-white pubescence, giving it its common name. The plant produces striking, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white to pale yellow, typically blooming in late spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous regions with well-drained soil. Due to its ornamental value and unique appearance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and by plant enthusiasts."
