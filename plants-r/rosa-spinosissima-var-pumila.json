    "intro": "Rosa spinosissima var. pumila, commonly known as the dwarf spinous rose, is a compact shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant is characterized by its thorny stems and dense, dark green foliage, which provide a striking visual contrast. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a decorative hedge. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for gardeners seeking a low-maintenance, visually appealing plant."
