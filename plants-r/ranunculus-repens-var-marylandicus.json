    "intro": "Ranunculus repens var. marylandicus, commonly known as Maryland buttercup, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is a low-growing herbaceous perennial that typically thrives in moist, sandy soils along the edges of wetlands and tidal areas. The plant features showy yellow flowers with 5 to 15 petals, and its leaves are palmately divided with a distinctive waxy coating. It spreads by rhizomes and can form dense mats, often colonizing disturbed or wetland habitats. The species is characterized by its adaptability to coastal environments and its role in stabilizing sandy shores."
