    "intro": "Rubus vallisparsus f. rarispinosus, commonly known as the rare spiny bramble, is a variant of the common bramble species characterized by its dense, thorny growth habit. It typically features dark green, trifoliate leaves with serrated edges, and produces small, aggregate fruits that range in color from red to black. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland undergrowth or along stream banks. Its thorns are more pronounced than in the typical form, providing a natural defense mechanism against herbivores. The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological role in its native habitat."
