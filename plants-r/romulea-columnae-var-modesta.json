It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, delicate flowers. The flowers, typically white or pale pink, are borne on slender stems and bloom in late summer. This variant is distinguished by its more subdued coloration compared to other varieties of Romulea columnae.
