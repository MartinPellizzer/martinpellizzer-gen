    "intro": "Rubus pluribracteatus var. lobatisepalus, commonly known as the broad-sepal raspberry, is a species native to parts of Asia, particularly China. It is a shrub characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The flowers are typically white or pale pink, with five broad, rounded sepals that give it its varietal name. The fruits, which are aggregate berries, are usually red and edible, though they are less commonly cultivated than other raspberry varieties. This plant thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland or scrubland habitats."
