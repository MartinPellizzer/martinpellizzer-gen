    "intro": "Rubus moluccanus var. gardnerianus, commonly known as the Moluccan raspberry, is a species of bramble native to the Maluku Islands in Indonesia. It is characterized by its thorny stems, trifoliate leaves, and aggregate fruits composed of small, bright red drupes. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and understoreys. It produces fragrant white flowers in the spring, which are followed by the edible berries in late summer. The species is valued for its ornamental qualities and has limited use in local traditional medicine."
