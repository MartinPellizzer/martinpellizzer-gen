    "intro": "Ranunculus pygmaeus var. langeanus, commonly known as the Lange's dwarf buttercup, is a small, herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features delicate, yellow flowers with five petals and numerous stamens, typical of the Ranunculaceae family. The plant has finely divided, trifoliate leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
