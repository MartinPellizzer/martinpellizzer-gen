    "intro": "Rhinanthus heribaudii, commonly known as the yellow rattle, is a flowering plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially depends on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant produces showy orange-yellow flowers that bloom from June to August. It is typically found in grasslands and meadows, often in association with grasses like wheat and rye. Rhinanthus heribaudii plays an important role in promoting biodiversity by reducing the dominance of dominant grasses."
