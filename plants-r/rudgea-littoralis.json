    "intro": "Rudgea littoralis, commonly known as the coastal rudgea, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of South America. It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Rudgea littoralis is adapted to salt spray and wind, making it a hardy species in coastal environments."
