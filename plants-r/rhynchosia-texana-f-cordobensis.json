    "intro": "Rhynchosia texana f. cordobensis, commonly known as the Cordoba variant of the Texas morning glory, is a variant of the species native to Central America and northern South America. It is a herbaceous vine characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically blue or violet in color. The plant produces small, round seeds enclosed in a capsule, which is a common feature among species in the Convolvulaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
