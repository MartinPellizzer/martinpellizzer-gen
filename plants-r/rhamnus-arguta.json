    "intro": "Rhamnus arguta, commonly known as the sandthorn or desert buckthorn, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, yellowish-green leaves and clusters of small, reddish berries that are edible for some animals but generally unpalatable to humans. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to thrive in dry, sandy soils and withstand periods of drought. Its thorny stems provide protection from herbivores, and it plays a role in stabilizing desert soils. Rhamnus arguta is also used in traditional medicine by some indigenous communities for its purported health benefits."
