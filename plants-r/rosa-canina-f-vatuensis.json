    "intro": "Rosa canina f. vatuensis, commonly known as the Vatuenis rose, is a botanical variant of the dog rose. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and smaller, more delicate flowers compared to the typical Rosa canina. The plant produces red-orange hips that are typically smaller and more numerous than those of the standard species. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. Its foliage is dark green and densely arranged, contributing to its ornamental value in horticultural settings."
