    "intro": "Rhipidocladum arenicola, commonly known as the sand dune spurge, is a low-growing perennial plant adapted to coastal and sandy environments. It has fleshy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to stabilize sand dunes and prevent erosion. Rhipidocladum arenicola is native to regions along the Atlantic coast, including parts of the United States and Europe."
