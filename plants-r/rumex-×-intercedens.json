    "intro": "Rumex \u00d7 intercedens, commonly known as the hybrid sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant that belongs to the Polygonaceae family. It is a natural hybrid between Rumex acetosa (common sorrel) and Rumex acetobulus (broad-leafed sorrel), resulting in a plant with distinctive morphological characteristics. The leaves are typically heart-shaped with a reddish coloration on the veins, and the plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits a range of genetic variability, making it an interesting subject for botanical study."
