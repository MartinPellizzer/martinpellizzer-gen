    "intro": "Rapuntium molle, commonly known as soft cress, is a herbaceous plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, temperate environments and is often found in meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges. Its seeds are encased in a spongy, pithy fruit known as a silique, which aids in seed dispersal. Rapuntium molle is also noted for its peppery flavor, making it a useful plant in culinary applications."
