    "intro": "Rhinorchis macilenta, commonly known as the slender orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, pale greenish-yellow flowers that bloom during the spring and early summer. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its slender stems and narrow leaves are adapted to its humid, low-light habitat, making it a challenging species to cultivate outside its natural range. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Rhinorchis macilenta is considered endangered in many areas."
