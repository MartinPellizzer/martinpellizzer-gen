    "intro": "Ranunculus \u00d7 pseudofluitans, commonly known as the water buttercup, is a hybrid aquatic plant that thrives in shallow freshwater environments. It features showy, yellow flowers with five to eight petals, often surrounded by a ring of sepals. The plant has slender, floating stems that support its leaves, which are typically divided into lobes. Its flowers open in the morning and close at night, a behavior known as nyctinasty. Ranunculus \u00d7 pseudofluitans is often found in ponds, marshes, and slow-moving streams, where it plays a role in aquatic ecosystems."
