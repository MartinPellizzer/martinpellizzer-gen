    "intro": "Rosa communis var. dilucida, commonly known as the dawn rose, is a rare and striking variant of the common rose. It is characterized by its pale pink petals that gradually shift to a soft white as the day progresses, creating a visual representation of the transition from dawn to daylight. The plant typically grows in temperate climates and prefers well-drained soil with partial sunlight. Its flowers bloom in late spring, producing a delicate fragrance that is most noticeable in the early morning. This unique botanical feature makes it a sought-after specimen in botanical gardens and among horticultural enthusiasts."
