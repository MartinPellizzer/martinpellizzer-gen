It typically features slender, spreading stems that form a dense mat on the ground. The leaves are lance-shaped, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and are arranged alternately along the stems. Small, white to pale pink flowers appear in clusters during the summer months. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks."
