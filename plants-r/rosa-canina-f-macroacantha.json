    "intro": "Rosa canina f. macroacantha, commonly known as the large-thorned dog rose, is a botanical variant of the dog rose species. It is characterized by its notably larger and more robust thorns compared to the typical Rosa canina. The plant produces fragrant pink or white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with serrated leaflets, and it bears red-orange hips that are rich in vitamin C. This subspecies is often found in hedgerows and woodland edges across Europe."
