    "intro": "Rosa gizellae f. wirtgenii, commonly known as the Wirtgen's rose, is a rare and hybrid form of the Rosa gizellae species. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and profuse blooming of semi-double pink flowers. The plant typically features thorny stems and dark green, ovate leaves with a slightly serrated margin. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a container plant. Due to its limited distribution and unique floral characteristics, it is highly valued in horticultural collections."
