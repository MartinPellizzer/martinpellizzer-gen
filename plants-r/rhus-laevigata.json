    "intro": "Rhus laevigata, commonly known as the smooth sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and turn vibrant red in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by reddish-orange berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds. Its bark is smooth and gray, and it thrives in a variety of soil types, including sandy and clay soils. Rhus laevigata is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in full sun."
