    "intro": "Ranunculus hydrocotyloides, commonly known as water buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features delicate, cup-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or white, with 5 to 15 sepals that resemble petals. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome and produces small, round, green leaves that are usually submerged or floating on the water surface. It thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, pond edges, and along streams. Its botanical characteristics make it an important species in aquatic ecosystems, supporting various insect and aquatic life forms."
