    "intro": "Reholttumia loyalii, commonly known as the Loyalii's ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the remote highlands of a small island in the Pacific. It is characterized by its translucent, waxy leaves that appear almost ethereal under sunlight. The plant produces delicate, bioluminescent blooms that emit a soft blue glow at night, a unique adaptation for attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its growth is extremely slow, with full maturity taking over a decade, making it highly vulnerable to environmental changes. Due to its rarity and ecological significance, it is classified as an endangered species and is protected by local conservation laws."
