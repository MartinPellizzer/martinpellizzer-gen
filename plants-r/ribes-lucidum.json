    "intro": "Ribes lucidum, commonly known as the glossy gooseberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It features slender, arching stems with small, dark green, glossy leaves that turn red in the fall. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are followed by edible, tart berries that ripen in late summer. Ribes lucidum thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sun. It is often found in wetlands, streambanks, and forest edges, contributing to local biodiversity."
