    "intro": "Rubus nitidus subsp. opacus, commonly known as the opacous blackberry, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thorny stems and dark, glossy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by edible, dark purple berries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or coastal habitats. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
