    "intro": "Rhytiglossa corymbulosa, commonly known as the clustered bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It features lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette, and its most distinctive characteristic is its clusters of bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or wetland habitats. Rhytiglossa corymbulosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting pollinators."
