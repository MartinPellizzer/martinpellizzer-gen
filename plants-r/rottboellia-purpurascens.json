    "intro": "Rottboellia purpurascens, commonly known as purple false brome, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its erect, often tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear violet or purple-colored flowers, which are typical of the genus Rottboellia. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including disturbed soils and open fields, and is often found in temperate regions. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes make it both a valuable forage plant and a potential weed in agricultural settings."
