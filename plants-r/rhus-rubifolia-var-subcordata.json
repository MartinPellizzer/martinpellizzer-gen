    "intro": "Rhus rubifolia var. subcordata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 5 to 9 pairs of oval, serrated leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in panicles, followed by red, fuzzy berries that are an important food source for birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and open woods. Its botanical features make it a valuable component of native plant communities and a popular choice for ecological restoration projects."
