    "intro": "Rhodiola neomexicana, commonly known as the New Mexico rosebay, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of the western United States. It belongs to the Crassulaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, succulent leaves and clusters of pink or red flowers. The plant is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments and thrives in well-drained soils. It is often found in alpine tundra and rocky habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife. Rhodiola neomexicana is also valued for its potential medicinal properties, though further research is needed to confirm its efficacy."
