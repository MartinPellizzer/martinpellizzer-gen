    "intro": "Rubus argenteus subsp. oplothyrsus, commonly known as the silverleaf blackberry, is a species of bramble native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its silvery-white undersides on its leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, dark purple berries that are typically consumed by birds and other wildlife. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions. This subspecies is often found in shrublands and along riverbanks, contributing to local biodiversity."
