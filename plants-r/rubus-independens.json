    "intro": "Rubus independens, commonly known as the independent raspberry, is a species of brambles native to the Andes Mountains in South America. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or black in color. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and partial shade. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
