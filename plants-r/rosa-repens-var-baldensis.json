    "intro": "Rosa repens var. baldensis, commonly known as the Bald Mountain rose, is a low-growing, trailing shrub native to the Appalachian region of the United States. It features slender, arching stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across rocky or open terrain. The plant produces fragrant, pink to red flowers in late spring to early summer, followed by orange-red hips that persist into autumn. Its leaves are compound, consisting of five to seven elliptical leaflets with serrated edges. This variety is adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments and is often found in rocky slopes and open woodlands."
