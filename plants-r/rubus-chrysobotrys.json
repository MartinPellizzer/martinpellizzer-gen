    "intro": "Rubus chrysobotrys, commonly known as the goldenfruit raspberry, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central America and is characterized by its erect or shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in the axils of the leaves. Its fruit is a red, hairy berry that ripens in the fall and is edible. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
