    "intro": "Rochelia lissocarpa, commonly known as the smooth-seeded rockcress, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants, and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. Its leaves are alternate and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain multiple seeds. Rochelia lissocarpa is an important part of the local flora and is often found in crevices and on rocky outcrops."
