    "intro": "Rheum crassinervium, commonly known as the broad-veined rhubarb, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It belongs to the Polygonaceae family, which includes other members such as buckwheat and sorrel. The plant is characterized by its large, broad leaves with prominent, parallel veins, and it produces small, greenish flowers in spring. Rheum crassinervium is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used historically in traditional medicine. Its rhubarb-like stalks are edible but are typically less commonly consumed compared to other rhubarb species."
