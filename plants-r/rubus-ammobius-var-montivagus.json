    "intro": "Rubus ammobius var. montivagus, commonly known as the mountain blackberry, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, dark purple berries that are typically harvested in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in high-altitude environments. Due to its rugged habitat, it is relatively rare and has limited cultivation outside its native range."
