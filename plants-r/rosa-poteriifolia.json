    "intro": "Rosa poteriifolia, commonly known as the Japanese rose or the climbing rose, is a deciduous shrub native to Japan and Korea. It is characterized by its thorny stems and large, lobed leaves that resemble the leaves of the maple tree. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white, typically in late spring to early summer. Rosa poteriifolia is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and can be trained to grow as a climbing plant. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade for optimal growth."
