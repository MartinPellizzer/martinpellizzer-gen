    "intro": "Rosa glauca f. acutifolia, commonly known as the blue rose with sharp leaves, is a botanical variant of the Rosa glauca species. It is characterized by its striking blue or bluish-pink flowers, which are a result of a natural mutation affecting pigmentation. The foliage is notable for its finely serrated, acutely pointed leaves, which give the plant its specific epithet. This form is typically a compact shrub with a bushy growth habit, often used in ornamental gardening for its unique color. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, requiring moderate water and pruning to maintain its shape."
