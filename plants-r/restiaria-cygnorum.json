    "intro": "Restiaria cygnorum, commonly known as the swan's rest, is a rare and elusive plant species native to the wetlands of northern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, pale green leaves that are arranged in a spiral pattern. The plant produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which bloom in late spring. Restiaria cygnorum is adapted to moist, nutrient-poor soils and thrives in areas with high water tables. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in several European countries."
