    "intro": "Ribes oxyacanthoides var. leucoderme, commonly known as the white-stemmed gooseberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its pale green to white stems, which distinguish it from other varieties of the species. The plant produces small, yellowish-green berries that are typically edible but not particularly flavorful. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas along streams and moist slopes. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
