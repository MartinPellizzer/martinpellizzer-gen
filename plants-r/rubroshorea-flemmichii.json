    "intro": "Rubroshorea flemmichii, commonly known as the Crimson Shorea, is a rare tropical tree native to the dense rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking red-brown bark and large, lance-shaped leaves that are glossy on top and pale underneath. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by woody, elongated fruits containing flat, seed-like structures. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Due to its rarity and ecological significance, it is considered a valuable species for conservation efforts."
