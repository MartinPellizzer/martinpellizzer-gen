    "intro": "Ricinus communis var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf castor plant, is a compact variety of the castor oil plant. It is characterized by its smaller stature compared to the standard castor plant, typically reaching heights of around 1 to 2 meters. The plant produces distinctive palmate leaves with a hairy texture and reddish veins. Its flowers are unisexual, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants. This variety is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its unique appearance and relatively manageable growth habit."
