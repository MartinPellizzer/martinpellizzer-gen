    "intro": "Rhamnus frangula var. paucinervosa, commonly known as the narrow-veined buckthorn, is a shrub native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, oval-shaped leaves with prominently visible veins, which give it its varietal name. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, followed by dark blue berries that are edible but often bitter. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and natural landscapes."
