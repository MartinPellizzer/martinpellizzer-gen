    "intro": "Ranunculus cherubicus subsp. girelai, commonly known as the Girelai crowfoot, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, palmate leaves and showy, bright yellow or orange flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its flowers are often visited by pollinators like bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological role in its native habitat. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly different leaf shape and flower size compared to other members of the Ranunculus genus."
