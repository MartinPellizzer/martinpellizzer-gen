    "intro": "Rauvolfia mannii, commonly known as African snakeroot, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its climbing habit and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that are clustered in cymes, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its roots are notable for containing the alkaloid reserpine, which has been historically used in traditional medicine. Rauvolfia mannii is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories."
