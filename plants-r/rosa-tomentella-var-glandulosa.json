    "intro": "Rosa tomentella var. glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular woolly rose, is a species of shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and thorny stems, which provide structural support and protection. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are covered in fine, glandular hairs that aid in water retention and deter herbivores. This variety is well adapted to arid and rocky environments, making it a resilient addition to xeriscapes and native plant gardens."
