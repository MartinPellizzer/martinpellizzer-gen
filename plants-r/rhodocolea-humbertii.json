    "intro": "Rhodocolea humbertii, commonly known as the Humbert's rhodocolea, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Madagascar. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in rocky or forested areas. Its leaves are simple and opposite, with a smooth texture, and it produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom during the rainy season. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
