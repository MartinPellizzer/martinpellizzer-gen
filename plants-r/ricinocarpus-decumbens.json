It is characterized by its low-growing, sprawling habit with numerous small, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, often in coastal or sandy soils. Due to its unique morphology and habitat preferences, it is of interest in ecological and botanical studies."
