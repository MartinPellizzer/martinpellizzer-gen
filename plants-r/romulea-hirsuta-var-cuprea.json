    "intro": "Romulea hirsuta var. cuprea, commonly known as the copper-flowered romulea, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features striking, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of bright orange to reddish-pink flowers, which are typically arranged in a raceme. Its bulbs are small and ovoid, storing nutrients to support growth during dormancy. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens and dry, well-drained soils."
