It is native to specific regions in Southeast Asia, where it thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color. Its fruit is a small, dry capsule that contains several seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
