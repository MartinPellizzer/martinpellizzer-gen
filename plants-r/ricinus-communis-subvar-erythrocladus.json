    "intro": "Ricinus communis subvar. erythrocladus, commonly known as the bloodleaf castor, is a variant of the castor oil plant characterized by its striking red and green foliage. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and thrives in warm, humid climates. The plant produces distinctive spiny capsules that contain toxic seeds, which are used in traditional medicine and as a source of castor oil. Its leaves are often used in ornamental gardening due to their vibrant coloration. However, it requires careful handling due to the presence of ricin, a potent toxin in its seeds."
