    "intro": "Roldana riparia, commonly known as the riverbank bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the wetlands and riverbanks of South America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones. Roldana riparia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing riverbanks."
