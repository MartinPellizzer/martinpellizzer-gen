    "intro": "Rhododendron wasonii, commonly known as the Wason's rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of central and western China. It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its dense, leathery leaves and clusters of bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters, thriving in cool, humid climates with well-drained soil. Its flowers, which range in color from pink to purple, are an important nectar source for pollinators. Rhododendron wasonii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and specialized horticultural collections."
