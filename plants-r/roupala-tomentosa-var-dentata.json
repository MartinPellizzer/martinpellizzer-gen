    "intro": "Roupala tomentosa var. dentata, commonly known as the hairy roupala, is a deciduous shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its grayish-white, pubescent bark and small, ovate leaves with serrated margins. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that appear in clusters, followed by spherical, woody fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely commercially grown."
