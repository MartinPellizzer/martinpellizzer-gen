    "intro": "Raputia santosii, commonly known as the Santos' raputia, is a rare and unique member of the Araceae family. It is native to the humid forests of eastern Brazil, where it thrives in shaded, moist environments. The plant features a short, rhizomatous stem with a single, large, heart-shaped leaf that can reach up to 30 cm in length. Its striking inflorescence consists of a spadix surrounded by a colorful spathe, often in shades of red or orange. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Raputia santosii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
