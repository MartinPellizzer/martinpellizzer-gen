    "intro": "Rhamnus taquetii, commonly known as the Taquet's buckthorn, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, elliptical leaves. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by small, fleshy berries that are a source of food for local wildlife. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native habitat."
