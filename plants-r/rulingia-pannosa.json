    "intro": "Rulingia pannosa, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical shrub native to regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves that are covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it has been introduced to other parts of the world, sometimes becoming invasive."
