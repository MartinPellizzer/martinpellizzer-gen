    "intro": "Rhabarbarum verum, commonly known as true rhubarb, is a perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It belongs to the Polygonaceae family and is characterized by its thick, fleshy stalks and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, pink or white flowers in the spring, which are followed by small, triangular fruits. The stalks are the primary edible part, though they contain oxalic acid and should be cooked before consumption. It is often cultivated for its culinary uses and ornamental value in gardens."
