    "intro": "Rosa tomentella var. dissimilis, commonly known as the woolly rose, is a shrub-like species native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its dense, grayish-white pubescence that covers its stems and leaves, giving it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, pink to red flowers in late spring to early summer, which are typically borne on the ends of the stems. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its overall rugged appearance. This variety is often found in rocky or alpine environments where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun."
