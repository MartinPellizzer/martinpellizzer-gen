    "intro": "Rourea palisotii, commonly known as the Hawaiian rourea, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Pacific, including Hawaii, Fiji, and Tahiti. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 2\u20135 meters, characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually greenish-white in color, followed by woody, spherical fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in coastal forests or along stream banks. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered in many of its native regions."
