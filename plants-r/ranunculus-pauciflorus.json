    "intro": "Ranunculus pauciflorus, commonly known as the few-flowered buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, palmate leaves and showy yellow or white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland edges and stream banks. Its flowers have five to seven sepals that resemble petals, and it produces small, smooth seeds in a follicle. Ranunculus pauciflorus is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
