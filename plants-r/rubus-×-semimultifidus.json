    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 semimultifidus, commonly known as the multiflora rose, is a hybrid shrub belonging to the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of fragrant white or pink flowers. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible but often tart in flavor. It is native to eastern North America and has been widely introduced elsewhere. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is considered a noxious weed in many regions."
