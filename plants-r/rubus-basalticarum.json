    "intro": "Rubus basalticarum, commonly known as the basaltic blackberry, is a rare shrub native to volcanic regions. It is characterized by its dark, nearly black berries that are rich in antioxidants. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils, often found in areas with basaltic rock formations. Its leaves are trifoliate, with a serrated edge and a slightly hairy texture. The flowers are small, white, and clustered, typically blooming in early summer."
