It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, which give it its varietal name \"pubescens.\" It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its fragrant blooms and compact size."
