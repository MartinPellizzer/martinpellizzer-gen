    "intro": "Rosa fedtschenkoana var. glandulosa, commonly known as the Himalayan shrub rose, is a rare and hardy species native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant exhibits a unique adaptation to cold climates, with thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss. Its flowers are typically pink or white, and it produces small, oval-shaped fruits known as hips. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and resilience in harsh mountain environments."
