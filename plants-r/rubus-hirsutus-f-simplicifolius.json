    "intro": "Rubus hirsutus f. simplicifolius, commonly known as the simple-leaved bramble, is a variant of the common blackberry plant. It is characterized by its simplified, less lobed leaves compared to the typical form of Rubus hirsutus. This plant is a shrub with thorny stems and produces aggregate fruits that are similar to blackberries. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils. Its botanical features make it a notable species within the Rubus genus for its morphological variation."
