    "intro": "Ricinus communis subvar. macrophyllus, commonly known as the giant castor bean, is a striking plant characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in diameter. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and thrives in warm, humid climates. The plant produces distinctive spiny capsules containing toxic seeds, which are used in traditional medicine and as a source of castor oil. Its ornamental value comes from its vibrant green foliage and unique floral structure. However, due to the toxicity of its seeds, it requires careful handling and is often grown in controlled environments."
