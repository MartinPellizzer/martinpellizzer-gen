    "intro": "Ranunculus boldtii, commonly known as the Boldt's buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the coastal regions of California. It features delicate, palmately divided leaves and showy, yellow flowers with prominent white veins. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, where it thrives in full sun. It is known for its short blooming period in spring and its role in supporting local pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
