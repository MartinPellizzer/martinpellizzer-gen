    "intro": "Rhodostachys chamissonis, commonly known as the pinkstem or coastal pinkstem, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of North America. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shorelines, where it tolerates salt spray and strong winds. Its flowers, which range from white to pink, bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Rhodostachys chamissonis is often used in coastal restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize dunes."
