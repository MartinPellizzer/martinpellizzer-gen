    "intro": "Rubus bollei, commonly known as the Bolle's blackberry, is a species of brambles native to South America, particularly in Argentina and Chile. It is characterized by its thorny stems and aggregate fruits, which are typically dark purple to black when mature. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by the development of its edible berries. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a serrated margin, typical of many Rubus species. The plant thrives in temperate climates and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests or along stream banks."
