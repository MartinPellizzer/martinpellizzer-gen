    "intro": "Rhododendron \u00d7 subdeciduum, commonly known as the deciduous azalea, is a hybrid shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its showy, funnel-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep pink, often appearing in clusters. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, with glossy, ovate leaves that turn yellow in the fall before shedding. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its early spring blooming period, which adds vibrant color to the landscape."
