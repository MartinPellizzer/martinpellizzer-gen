    "intro": "Rinorea castaneoides, commonly known as the red sandalwood or sweet sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and simple, opposite leaves that are elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences, followed by small, round fruits containing single seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine, it is sometimes cultivated for horticultural purposes."
