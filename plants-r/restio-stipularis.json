    "intro": "Restio stipularis, commonly known as the stipular restio, is a member of the Restionaceae family, native to southern Africa. It is a perennial herb characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically arranged in dense clusters at the tips of the stems. Restio stipularis thrives in coastal and sandy environments, often found in fynbos vegetation. Its ecological significance lies in its role as a habitat for various invertebrates and its contribution to the biodiversity of its native region."
