    "intro": "Ravensara retusa, commonly known as the New Zealand rosewood, is a small evergreen tree native to the subtropical regions of New Zealand. It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its aromatic, dark green leaves and fragrant flowers. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are followed by bright red berries. Ravensara retusa is valued for its hard, dark wood, which has been traditionally used by M\u0101ori for carving and tool-making. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is now classified as endangered and is protected in its native range."
