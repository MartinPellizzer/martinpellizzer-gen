    "intro": "Renealmia floribunda, commonly known as the pink river lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to South America. It features broad, lance-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, often displaying a waxy, pinkish hue. The plant produces showy, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its rhizomes spread along the bottom of water bodies, forming dense colonies that help stabilize aquatic ecosystems. Renealmia floribunda is valued in ornamental ponds for its aesthetic appeal and ecological benefits."
