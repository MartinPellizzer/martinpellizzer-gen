    "intro": "Rapanea glandulosa, commonly known as the glossy teak or mountain teak, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark green, leathery leaves that are often covered in small, glandular dots. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers followed by elliptical, fleshy fruits that contain smooth, black seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland and hill forest areas. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is cultivated in botanical gardens and as a landscape plant in tropical regions."
