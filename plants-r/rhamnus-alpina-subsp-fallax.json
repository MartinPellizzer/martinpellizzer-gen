    "intro": "Rhamnus alpina subsp. fallax, commonly known as the Alpine buckthorn, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It produces small yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by dark blue berries that are edible for some wildlife. This subspecies is notable for its hardy nature and ability to survive in harsh, high-altitude conditions."
