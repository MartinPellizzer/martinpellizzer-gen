    "intro": "Rosa anfracta, commonly known as the mountain rose or the alpine rose, is a species of flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or alpine soils. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink and red, depending on the variety. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets, and it has thorny stems typical of many rose species. Rosa anfracta is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in cooler climates."
