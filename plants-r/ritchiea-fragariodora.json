    "intro": "Ritchiea fragariodora, commonly known as the red-veined fern, is a striking tropical plant native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its intricate, frond-like leaves with deep red veins contrasting against its bright green background. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and ornamental purposes. However, it requires high humidity and indirect light to thrive, making it somewhat challenging for novice plant growers."
