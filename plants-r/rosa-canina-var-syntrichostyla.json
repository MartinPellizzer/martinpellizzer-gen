    "intro": "Rosa canina var. syntrichostyla, commonly known as the bristly dogrose, is a botanical variant of the common dogrose. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which give it a distinct appearance compared to the standard Rosa canina. The flowers are typically pink or red, with five petals and numerous stamens, typical of the Rosaceae family. This variant is often found in dry, open habitats such as heathlands and woodland edges. Its fruit, a red, hairy rose hip, is a key feature and serves as a food source for various wildlife."
