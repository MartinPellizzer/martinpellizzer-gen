    "intro": "Rhynchospora hirta var. tenuior, commonly known as slender hairy sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, swales, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are densely covered with short, stiff hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its inflorescence consists of a spike of small, three-lobed flowers that are typically greenish or reddish in color. This variety is characterized by its shorter stature and more delicate foliage compared to the typical form of Rhynchospora hirta."
