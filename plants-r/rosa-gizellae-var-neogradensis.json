    "intro": "Rosa gizellae var. neogradensis, commonly known as the Neogradensian rose, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. This variant is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, fragrant flowers that range in color from pale pink to deep red. The plant typically produces semi-double to fully double blooms, which are often accompanied by dark green, serrated leaves. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
