It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows in temperate regions, often in moist, wooded areas. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits known as drupes, which are usually red or yellow when ripe. Its flowers are white and clustered in the axils of the leaves, and it is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value.
