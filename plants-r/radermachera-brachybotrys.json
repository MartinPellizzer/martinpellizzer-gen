    "intro": "Radermachera brachybotrys, commonly known as the Japanese evergreen maple, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to Japan and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are heart-shaped and often have a slight serration along the edges. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by round, orange-red fruits known as schizocarps. It is a slow-growing shrub that thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its foliage provides year-round visual interest, especially in colder climates where it retains its leaves through winter."
