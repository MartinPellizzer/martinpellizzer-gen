    "intro": "Ricinoides americana, commonly known as the American ricinweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny, dry seeds. It typically grows in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and fields. Due to its low-growing nature and rapid spread, it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
