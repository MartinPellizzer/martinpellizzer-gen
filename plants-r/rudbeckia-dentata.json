    "intro": "Rudbeckia dentata, commonly known as the toothed coneflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern and central United States. It features bright yellow, daisy-like flowers with a distinctive brown, cone-shaped center, and its leaves are deeply toothed, giving it its scientific name. The plant typically grows to a height of 2 to 4 feet, with hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for native plant gardens. Rudbeckia dentata is known for its resilience and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
