    "intro": "Rubus eriocarpus, commonly known as the woolly blackberry, is a species of bramble native to western North America. It is characterized by its dense, woolly pubescence covering the stems and leaves, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, dark berries that are typically edible, though they are often overshadowed by more commercially valuable blackberry species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The botanical features of Rubus eriocarpus make it an important component of its native ecosystems, supporting various wildlife species."
