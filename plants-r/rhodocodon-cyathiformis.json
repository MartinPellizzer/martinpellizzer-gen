    "intro": "Rhodocodon cyathiformis, commonly known as the cup-shaped bellflower, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its unique, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or violet in color. The plant features a short, upright stem with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Rhodocodon cyathiformis is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
