    "intro": "Ranunculus aquatilis var. longifolius, commonly known as the long-leaved water buttercup, is a aquatic plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in freshwater habitats such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. The plant features slender, ribbon-like leaves that are often submerged or floating on the water surface. Its flowers are yellow with prominent black veins, and they bloom from spring to early summer. It plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and serving as a food source for waterfowl."
