    "intro": "Rubus discerptus maranensis, commonly known as the Maranese raspberry, is a species of bramble native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, aggregate fruits that ripen to a deep red color. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline, where it thrives in full sun. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it produces white flowers in the spring. The fruit is often used in local cuisine and traditional medicine due to its tart flavor and potential medicinal properties."
