    "intro": "Restrepia seketii, commonly known as the Sierra Leone orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of West Africa. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and delicate, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, with intricate patterns that attract specific pollinators. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Restrepia seketii is considered threatened in its natural range."
