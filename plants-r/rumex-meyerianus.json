    "intro": "Rumex meyerianus, commonly known as Meyer's sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It features upright stems that are often reddish in color and bear alternate, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive reddish or purplish hue. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on terminal inflorescences. Its leaves are edible and have a tangy, sour flavor due to the presence of oxalic acid. Rumex meyerianus is often found in moist, disturbed soils along stream banks and in woodland edges."
