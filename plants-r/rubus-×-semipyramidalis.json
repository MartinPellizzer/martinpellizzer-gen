    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 semipyramidalis, commonly known as the pyramidal blackberry, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Rubus ursinus (slippery evening-primrose) and Rubus  fruticosus (common bramble). It is characterized by its thorny stems and dark green, trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, dark purple berries that are typically harvested in late summer. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in hedgerows and woodland edges. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is cultivated in some regions for both aesthetic and culinary purposes."
