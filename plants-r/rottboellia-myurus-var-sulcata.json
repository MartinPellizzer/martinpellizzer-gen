    "intro": "Rottboellia myurus var. sulcata, commonly known as the ridged grass or sulcate rottboellia, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a distinct ridge along the midrib. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its root system is fibrous and helps stabilize soil, making it useful in erosion control. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and disturbed areas."
