    "intro": "Rapuntium thapsoideum, commonly known as the desert buttercup, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Mediterranean and parts of Asia. It is a low-growing perennial that typically reaches heights of 10\u201330 cm, with a rosette of fleshy, gray-green leaves that help it retain moisture. The plant produces yellow flowers with five petals, often appearing in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry gardens."
