It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with three to five leaflets. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically edible. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
