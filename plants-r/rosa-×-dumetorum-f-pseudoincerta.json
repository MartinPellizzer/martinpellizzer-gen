    "intro": "Rosa \u00d7 dumetorum f. pseudoincerta, commonly known as the creeping shrub rose, is a hybrid plant that exhibits characteristics of both Rosa rugosa and Rosa serotina. It is a low-growing, thorny shrub with dense foliage and clusters of fragrant, pink to white flowers. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptic, with serrated margins, and the plant produces small, red-orange hips in the autumn. It is often found in coastal areas and moist soils, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade.
