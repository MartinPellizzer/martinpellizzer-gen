    "intro": "Rupertia physodes, commonly known as the white rupertia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its hairy, upright stems and clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats, such as slopes and meadows, and is adapted to arid conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a fuzzy texture, which helps reduce water loss. Rupertia physodes is also known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
