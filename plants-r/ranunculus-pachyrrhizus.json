It is characterized by its hairy stems and basal leaves that are deeply lobed. The plant produces showy yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its root system is notably thick and fleshy, which helps it survive in dry conditions. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or steppe environments."
