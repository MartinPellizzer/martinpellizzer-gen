    "intro": "Rubus argenteus var. pseudonemoralis, commonly known as the silverleaf bramble, is a deciduous shrub native to the temperate regions of North America. It features slender, arching stems covered in dense white or silver hairs, giving it a distinctive silvery appearance. The leaves are usually trifoliate, with a broad base and finely serrated margins, and they turn red in the fall. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers in the spring, followed by edible, red berries that are often used in jams and wines. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland edges and stream banks."
