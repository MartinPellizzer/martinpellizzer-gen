It features elongated, arrow-shaped leaves that are typically green and slightly hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually white or pale green, arranged in a spike-like cluster. Rapa oblonga thrives in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
