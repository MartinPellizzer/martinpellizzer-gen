    "intro": "Rotala mexicana, commonly known as Mexican waterwheel, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is a member of the Pontederiaceae family and is characterized by its whorled arrangement of bright green, oval leaves. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in wetland environments and is often used in aquatic gardens due to its ornamental value. Rotala mexicana is also valued for its ability to improve water quality by absorbing nutrients from the surrounding environment."
