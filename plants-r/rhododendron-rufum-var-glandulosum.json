    "intro": "Rhododendron rufum var. glandulosum, commonly known as the glandular red rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of showy, pink to reddish flowers that bloom in early spring. The leaves are typically oval-shaped with a glossy surface and are often covered in small, glandular dots, giving the plant its varietal name. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. This variety is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
