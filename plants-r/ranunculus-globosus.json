It features a short, stout stem that supports a single, globe-shaped flower head composed of numerous small, yellowish-white petals. The plant produces a cluster of bright yellow stamens surrounded by a ring of petal-like sepals, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its leaves are palmately divided into several lobes, and the plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats.
