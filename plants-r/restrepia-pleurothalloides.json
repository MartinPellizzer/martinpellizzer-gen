    "intro": "Restrepia pleurothalloides, commonly known as the pleurothalloid orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and the presence of a pseudobulb, which stores water and nutrients. The plant produces delicate, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive lip that is often marked with purple or brown spots. It thrives in cool, humid environments with well-drained soil, typically found in rocky or forested areas. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in the wild."
