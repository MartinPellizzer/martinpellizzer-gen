    "intro": "Rudbeckia hirta f. dichrona, commonly known as the black-eyed Susan variety with double flowers, is a flowering plant belonging to the sunflower family (Asteraceae). It is characterized by its dark central disk surrounded by double rows of yellow petals, distinguishing it from the typical single-flowered form. The plant is native to North America and thrives in full sun to partial shade, preferring well-drained soil. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens due to its vibrant color and long blooming period. This form exhibits a more compact growth habit compared to the standard Rudbeckia hirta."
