    "intro": "Rosa abietina f. pycnocephala, commonly known as the dense-headed alpine rose, is a compact shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, rounded growth habit and small, dark green leaves. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
