It is characterized by its dark, almost black berries that ripen in late summer. The plant typically grows in hedgerows and woodland edges, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and its stems are thorny. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and edible fruits, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
