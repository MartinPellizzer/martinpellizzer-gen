These plants are characterized by their compact growth habit and showy, often fragrant flowers. Rhynchadenia species are typically found in rocky or coastal habitats, where they thrive in well-drained soils. Their roots are often adapted to absorb moisture from crevices in the substrate. The genus includes several species, each with unique floral structures that reflect adaptations to specific ecological niches."
