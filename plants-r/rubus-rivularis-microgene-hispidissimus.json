    "intro": "Rubus rivularis microgene hispidissimus, commonly known as the hairy dewberry, is a species of bramble native to certain regions of North America. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and small, hairy leaves that are typically oval in shape. The plant produces clusters of white flowers in the spring, which are followed by edible, red berries in the summer. Its fruit is often used in local culinary traditions, though it is less common than other Rubus species. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found along stream banks and in woodland areas."
