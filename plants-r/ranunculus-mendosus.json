It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its showy, bright yellow petals and a central cluster of stamens. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It produces small, green, oval-shaped fruits that contain several seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ranunculus mendosus is considered a rare and endangered species."
