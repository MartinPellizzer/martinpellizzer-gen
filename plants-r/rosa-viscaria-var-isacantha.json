    "intro": "Rosa viscaria var. isacantha, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada rock rose, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and small, fragrant pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, with a fuzzy texture that helps reduce water loss. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
