    "intro": "Rudbeckia leucantha, commonly known as the white coneflower, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It features showy yellow disk flowers surrounded by white to pale yellow ray flowers, creating a striking visual contrast. The plant typically grows to a height of 2 to 3 feet, with lance-shaped, hairy leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained, loamy soil. Rudbeckia leucantha is often found in wetlands, prairies, and along stream banks, where it plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
