    "intro": "Rhododendron dubium, commonly known as the African rhododendron, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa, particularly South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in shrub form, reaching heights of up to 3 meters, and thrives in well-drained, acidic soils. It is often found in mountainous regions and is adapted to cool, moist climates. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it requires specific care to flourish."
