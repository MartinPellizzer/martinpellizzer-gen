    "intro": "Rosa communis var. pseudocomplicata, commonly known as the Mock Thorns Rose, is a less commonly cultivated variety of the rose genus. It is characterized by its thorny stems and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or white. The plant has simple, alternate leaves with serrated edges, typical of many rose species. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for garden cultivation. While not as popular as other rose varieties, it is valued for its hardiness and ornamental features."
