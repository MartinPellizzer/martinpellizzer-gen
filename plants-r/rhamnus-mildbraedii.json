It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in the spring, which are followed by black, berry-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions."
