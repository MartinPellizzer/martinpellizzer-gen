    "intro": "Rhus caroliniana, commonly known as the winged sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are divided into narrow, wing-like segments that give the plant its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in panicles, followed by red, fuzzy berries that are a food source for birds and other wildlife. Rhus caroliniana thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in open woods, along roadsides, and in disturbed areas. Its adaptability and ornamental features make it a popular plant for landscaping and ecological restoration projects."
