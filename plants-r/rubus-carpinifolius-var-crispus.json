    "intro": "Rubus carpinifolius var. crispus, commonly known as the crinkled bramble, is a deciduous shrub native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often hairy and have a crinkled appearance, giving it its varietal name. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or black in color, similar to other raspberries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or mountainous regions. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
