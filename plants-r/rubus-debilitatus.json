    "intro": "Rubus debilitatus, commonly known as the weak raspberry, is a species of bramble native to the western United States. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features compound leaves with three to five leaflets and produces small, aggregate fruits that are usually red or yellow in color. Its flowers are white or pale pink and are borne in clusters at the ends of the stems. Rubus debilitatus is often found in association with other members of the Rubus genus, and it plays a role in supporting local wildlife."
