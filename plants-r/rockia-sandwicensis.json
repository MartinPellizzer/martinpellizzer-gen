    "intro": "Rockia sandwicensis, commonly known as the Hawaiian rockia, is a rare flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and woody stems. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is typically found in coastal and lowland areas. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, it is considered endangered and is protected under conservation efforts. Its unique adaptations to the Hawaiian ecosystem make it an important species for ecological studies."
