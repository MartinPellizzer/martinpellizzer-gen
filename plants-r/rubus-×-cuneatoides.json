It is a shrub with thorny stems and compound leaves, typically featuring three to five leaflets. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are usually dark red to black in color, with a tart flavor. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its edible berries. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable species in both horticulture and ecological studies."
