    "intro": "Rebutia wessneriana var. calliantha, commonly known as the Orange Coral Cactus, is a compact, low-growing succulent native to South America. It features a dense cluster of cylindrical stems that are typically pale green to yellowish in color. The plant produces vibrant orange flowers during the spring and summer months, which are often borne in clusters at the ends of the stems. Its fleshy stems are adapted to store water, making it well-suited for arid environments. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, requiring minimal water to prevent root rot."
