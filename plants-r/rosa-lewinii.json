    "intro": "Rosa lewinii, commonly known as the desert rose or Lewin's rose, is a species of flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring woody stems and dense foliage. The plant produces showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets, and it has a deep root system adapted to survive in dry conditions. Rosa lewinii is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
