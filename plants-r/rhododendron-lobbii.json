    "intro": "Rhododendron lobbii, commonly known as the Lobb's rhododendron, is a rare and striking evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink to red, often with a distinctive white or pale pink throat. The plant prefers cool, moist, acidic soils and thrives in shaded to semi-shaded environments. Its leaves are dark green, leathery, and elliptical in shape, contributing to its ornamental value. Due to its limited natural habitat and susceptibility to environmental changes, it is considered a conservation concern."
