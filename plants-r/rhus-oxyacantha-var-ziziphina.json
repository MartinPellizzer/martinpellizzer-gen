    "intro": "Rhus oxyacantha var. ziziphina, commonly known as the smooth sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern and central United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and turn bright red in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by red, fuzzy fruit clusters that persist through winter. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping and ecological restoration projects."
