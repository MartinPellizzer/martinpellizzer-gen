    "intro": "Rosa quasigrypacena, commonly known as the near-eastern rose, is a rare species of flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its clustered, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to deep pink, typically blooming in late summer. The plant has simple, alternate leaves with serrated edges, and its stems are covered in soft, glandular hairs. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Rosa quasigrypacena is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
