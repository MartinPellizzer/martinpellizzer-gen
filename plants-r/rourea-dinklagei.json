    "intro": "Rourea dinklagei, commonly known as the Dinklage's rourea, is a species of flowering plant in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is native to the Andes Mountains in South America, specifically in regions of Ecuador and Peru. The plant is characterized by its woody stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, and it is typically found in moist, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Rourea dinklagei is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
