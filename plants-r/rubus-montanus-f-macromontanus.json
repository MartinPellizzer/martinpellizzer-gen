    "intro": "Rubus montanus f. macromontanus, commonly known as the large-fruited bramble, is a botanical variant of the common bramble. It is characterized by its larger, more robust leaves and fruits compared to the typical Rubus montanus. The plant is typically found in temperate regions, growing in woodlands and hedgerows. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, and the fruits are edible, though often tart. This form is of interest to botanists due to its distinct morphological features and potential for hybridization."
