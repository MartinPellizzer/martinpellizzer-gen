    "intro": "Russelia lanceifolia, commonly known as the red-hot cat's tail, is a striking tropical shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its long, red bracts that resemble a cat's tail, which are actually modified leaves, not flowers. The plant produces small, tubular yellow flowers that bloom in clusters along the stems. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Russelia lanceifolia is often cultivated for its ornamental value and vibrant, eye-catching appearance."
