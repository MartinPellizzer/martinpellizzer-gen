    "intro": "Rosa glauca f. bernardensis, commonly known as the Bernard's blue rose, is a unique horticultural form of the Rosa glauca species. It is characterized by its striking pale blue to lavender-colored flowers, which are more intensely pigmented than those of the typical Rosa glauca. This variety is typically compact, with semi-evergreen foliage that retains its color throughout the growing season. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Due to its ornamental value and rarity, it is often cultivated by enthusiasts and botanic gardens."
