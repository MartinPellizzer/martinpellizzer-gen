    "intro": "Rumex conglomeratus var. campestris, commonly known as broadleaf dock, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features broad, heart-shaped leaves with a waxy surface and prominent veins, often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in dense clusters during late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in wet meadows. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread readily and form dense stands."
