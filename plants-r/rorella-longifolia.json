    "intro": "Rorella longifolia, commonly known as the long-leaved rorella, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of South America. It features slender, upright stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, adorned with long, narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. Rorella longifolia thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or riparian habitats."
