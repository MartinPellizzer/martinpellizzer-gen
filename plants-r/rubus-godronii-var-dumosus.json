    "intro": "Rubus godronii var. dumosus, commonly known as the dense raspberry or hairy bramble, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its thorny stems and dense, sprawling growth habit, which helps it thrive in rocky and disturbed soils. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or yellow when ripe, attracting various pollinators and wildlife. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and are covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and unique form."
