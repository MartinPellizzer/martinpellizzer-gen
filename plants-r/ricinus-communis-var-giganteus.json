    "intro": "Ricinus communis var. giganteus, commonly known as the giant castor bean plant, is a striking ornamental species native to tropical regions. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that can reach up to 30 inches in diameter, giving it a dramatic visual presence. The plant produces distinctive spiky seed pods containing toxic, oil-rich seeds that are a key feature of the species. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care and kept away from children and pets."
