    "intro": "Rubus crataegifolius f. subcuneatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf blackberry, is a variant of the crataegifolius blackberry species. It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves that resemble those of hawthorn, giving it its specific epithet. The plant produces small, dark purple berries that are typically less vigorous than other blackberry varieties. It is native to the eastern United States and thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and less commonly cultivated member of the Rubus genus."
