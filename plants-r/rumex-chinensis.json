    "intro": "Rumex chinensis, commonly known as Chinese sorrel, is a perennial herb native to East Asia. It features upright, branched stems and alternate, heart-shaped leaves with a serrated margin. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its leaves are edible and have a tangy, sour flavor due to the presence of oxalic acid. Rumex chinensis is often cultivated for both ornamental and culinary purposes."
