    "intro": "Rotang crinitus, commonly known as the hairy mangrove, is a species of mangrove tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive hairy texture on the bark and leaves, which helps in reducing water loss in saline environments. The plant thrives in brackish water and tidal zones, playing a crucial role in coastal ecosystems. Its roots form a complex network that stabilizes soil and prevents erosion. Additionally, it is valued for its durable timber, which has been traditionally used in construction and furniture making."
