    "intro": "Rubus compactus, commonly known as the dwarf blackberry, is a shrub native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its dense, thorny growth habit and small, dark red to black berries. The plant has trifoliate leaves with serrated edges and produces white to pink flowers in the spring. Its berries are edible but often have a tart flavor, and the plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and wildlife habitat. Rubus compactus thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or rocky areas."
