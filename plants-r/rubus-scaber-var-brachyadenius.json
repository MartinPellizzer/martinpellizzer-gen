    "intro": "Rubus scaber var. brachyadenius, commonly known as the brachyadenius raspberry, is a variant of the raspberry plant native to specific regions of North America. It is characterized by its densely hairy stems and leaves, which provide a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red when ripe, though they may vary in color depending on environmental conditions. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland or shaded areas. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a less common species within the Rubus genus."
