    "intro": "Rhus microcarpa, commonly known as the staghorn sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern and central United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically arranged in pairs along the stems, and its clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in the spring. The plant produces red, fuzzy berries that are an important food source for birds and wildlife. Rhus microcarpa thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in open woods, along roadsides, and in disturbed areas. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate urban environments."
