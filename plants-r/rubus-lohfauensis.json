    "intro": "Rubus lohfauensis, commonly known as the Lohfau bramble, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of southern China, where it thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil. The plant is characterized by its thorny stems, compound leaves, and clusters of small white or pink flowers. Its fruits, which are edible, are similar to raspberries but have a distinct flavor and texture. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
