It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with slender, erect stems and narrow leaves. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that bear tiny, three-lobed flowers. It is native to tropical regions of South America and is often found in wetland or marshy habitats. Due to its potential psychoactive properties, it is of interest in both botanical and ethnobotanical research."
