    "intro": "Reaumuria alternifolia subsp. panjgurica, commonly known as the Panjgur reaumuria, is a shrub native to arid regions of Pakistan. It is characterized by its alternate, narrow leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by red or orange berries. It is well adapted to harsh, saline soils and can thrive in low-water conditions. This subspecies is of interest for its ecological role in stabilizing desert soils and its potential for use in phytoremediation."
