    "intro": "Rosa vagiana, commonly known as the wandering rose, is a species of flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its fragrant, pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows as a shrub with thorny stems and compound leaves composed of five to seven leaflets. Its botanical name reflects its tendency to spread and colonize various habitats, often appearing in disturbed or open areas. Rosa vagiana is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in perfumery and medicine."
