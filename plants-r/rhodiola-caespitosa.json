    "intro": "Rhodiola caespitosa, commonly known as the mountain rhodiola, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It features a compact, cushion-like growth habit with dense clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer, typically in clusters at the ends of its stems. It is well adapted to cold, high-altitude environments and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils. Rhodiola caespitosa is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
