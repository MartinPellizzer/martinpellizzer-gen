    "intro": "Roegneria albicans, commonly known as the white wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its fine, silver-green leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on rocky or alpine soils. The plant produces small, pale spikelets that are typically wind-pollinated, and it blooms in late spring to early summer. Roegneria albicans is adapted to cold climates and can thrive in high-altitude environments with limited nutrients. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in some regions for landscaping and erosion control."
