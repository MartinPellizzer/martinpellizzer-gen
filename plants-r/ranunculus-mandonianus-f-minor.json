    "intro": "Ranunculus mandonianus f. minor, commonly known as the small Mandonian buttercup, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family, characterized by its showy, often brightly colored flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its foliage consists of trifoliate leaves with finely divided lobes, and its flowers are usually pale yellow with a distinctive central blotch. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
