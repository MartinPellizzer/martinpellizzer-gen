    "intro": "Ramium macrophyllum, commonly known as the large-leaf ramium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that can grow up to 15 cm in length, with a smooth, waxy surface. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late winter to early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in swampy or riparian habitats. Ramium macrophyllum plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and nectar for various pollinators."
