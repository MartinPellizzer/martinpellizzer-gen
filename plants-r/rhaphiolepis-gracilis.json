    "intro": "Rhaphiolepis gracilis, commonly known as the fragrant rosebay, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It features small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring. The plant has glossy, oval-shaped leaves that provide an attractive foliage display throughout the growing season. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it suitable for garden landscapes. Its ornamental value comes from both its floral display and its compact, bushy growth habit."
