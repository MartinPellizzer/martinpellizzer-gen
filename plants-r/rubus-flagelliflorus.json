    "intro": "Rubus flagelliflorus, commonly known as the whipflower raspberry, is a species of brambles native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, red, edible berries similar to raspberries, though they are less commonly consumed. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the stems are covered in fine, soft hairs. This plant thrives in moist, wooded areas and is often found in the understory of forests."
