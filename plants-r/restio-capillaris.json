It belongs to the Restionaceae family and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny white to pale blue flowers. It thrives in coastal and sandy environments, often growing in coastal dunes or along the edges of fynbos vegetation. Restio capillaris is typically evergreen and plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils in its native habitat."
