    "intro": "Rhododendron mucronulatum f. albiflorum, commonly known as the White-flowered Stewartia, is a rare and striking variant of the Stewartia genus. It is characterized by its pale white to cream-colored flowers, which contrast beautifully with its dark green foliage. This plant is native to China and is typically found in mountainous regions with cool, moist climates. Its botanical features include large, ovate leaves and a compact, shrub-like growth habit. Due to its rarity and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by specialty horticulturists."
