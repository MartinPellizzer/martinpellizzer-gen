    "intro": "Rubus mercicus castranus, commonly known as the Castran blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the temperate regions of Europe. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and thorny stems, typical of many Rubus species. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically harvested in late summer. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it thrives in well-drained soils. The Castran blackberry is valued for both its ornamental appeal and its edible fruits."
