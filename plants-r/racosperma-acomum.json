    "intro": "Racosperma acomum, commonly known as the narrow-leafed acacia, is a shrub native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often sparsely haired leaves and produces yellow flowers in clustered inflorescences. The plant is part of the legume family, Fabaceae, and has a deep root system that helps it thrive in sandy or rocky soils. It is often found in coastal and inland regions, adapting well to dry and saline conditions. The seeds are enclosed in pod-like fruits and are an important food source for various native fauna."
