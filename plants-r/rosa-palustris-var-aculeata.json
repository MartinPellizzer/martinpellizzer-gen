    "intro": "Rosa palustris var. aculeata, commonly known as the swamp rose, is a deciduous shrub native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its slender stems and small, fragrant pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges, and its thorny stems provide structural support. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in marshes, bogs, and along the edges of ponds. This variety is notable for its adaptability to wet conditions and its role in supporting local wildlife."
