    "intro": "Rhizocephalum pumilum, commonly known as the dwarf root parasite, is a unique parasitic plant that primarily infects crustaceans, particularly crabs. It lacks typical green structures and instead relies on a specialized root-like structure called a \"haustorium\" to absorb nutrients from its host. The plant produces a sticky, gelatinous substance that helps it attach to the exoskeleton of its host. It is typically found in marine environments, where it thrives in warm, shallow waters. Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a significant role in the ecological dynamics of its host populations."
