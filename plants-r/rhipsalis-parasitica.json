    "intro": "Rhipsalis parasitica, commonly known as the mistletoe cactus, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of trees and shrubs. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, though it can photosynthesize to a limited extent. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are often clustered together. Its fruit is typically a small, fleshy berry that contains seeds dispersed by birds. Rhipsalis parasitica is found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in humid, shaded environments."
