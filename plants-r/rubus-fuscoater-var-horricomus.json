It is characterized by its thorny stems and aggregate fruits that mature to a deep black color. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by the development of its edible berries. It thrives in moist, wooded areas and is often found in shaded environments. The leaves are typically trifoliate, with serrated edges and a slightly hairy texture."
