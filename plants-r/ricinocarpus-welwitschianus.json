    "intro": "Ricinocarpus welwitschianus, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Anacardiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and simple, alternate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody, fleshy fruits containing numerous seeds. It is valued for its hard, heavy wood used in furniture and tool handles, though it is also considered a threatened species due to habitat loss. The plant has medicinal uses in traditional medicine, though its toxicity requires caution in handling."
