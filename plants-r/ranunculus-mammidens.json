    "intro": "Ranunculus mammidens, commonly known as the mammillate buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to southern Africa. It features showy, yellow flowers with five to eight petals, often with a distinctive white or greenish center. The plant has a short, stout stem with hairy leaves that are palmately divided into three to five lobes. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and along stream banks. Its botanical name reflects the textured, bumpy surface of its leaves, which are characteristic of the species."
