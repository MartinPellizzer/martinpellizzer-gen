    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 amygdalothyrsus, commonly known as the blackberry-pear hybrid, is a botanical hybrid resulting from the cross between a blackberry (Rubus) and a pear (Pyrus). It exhibits characteristics of both parent species, with the appearance of a blackberry and the fruit structure of a pear. The plant typically grows as a shrub with thorny stems and broad, lobed leaves. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, and the fruit is a large, fleshy berry with a sweet-tart flavor. This hybrid is of interest in horticulture for its unique morphology and potential for cultivating novel fruit varieties."
