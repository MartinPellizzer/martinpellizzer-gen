    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 euchrous, commonly known as the blackberry raspberry, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between a blackberry (Rubus fruticosus) and a raspberry (Rubus idaeus). It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves, typical of the Rubus genus. The plant produces aggregate fruits composed of small, bright red drupelets that are often consumed fresh or used in culinary applications. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, and it thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil. Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits a range of morphological and genetic variations."
