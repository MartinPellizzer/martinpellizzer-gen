    "intro": "Rorippa hispida var. glabrata, commonly known as smooth watercress, is a flowering plant in the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its small, alternate leaves that are smooth and glossy, often floating on the surface of shallow freshwater habitats. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers with four petals, typical of the mustard family. It thrives in moist environments such as ponds, streams, and wet meadows. Its rapid growth and ability to reproduce vegetatively make it a common and persistent aquatic plant."
