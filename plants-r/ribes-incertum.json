    "intro": "Ribes incertum, commonly known as the uncertain gooseberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters and features alternate, ovate to elliptic leaves with serrated margins. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible but often tart. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in moist, shaded environments. The species is notable for its ornamental value and potential use in ecological restoration projects."
