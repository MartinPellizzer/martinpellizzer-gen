    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 complicatus, commonly known as the blackberry raspberry, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between blackberries (Rubus fruticosus) and raspberries (Rubus idaeus). It is a thorny shrub that produces aggregate fruits, which are typically dark red to black in color. The plant has trifoliate leaves and produces flowers that are usually pink or white. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in hedgerows, woodlands, and disturbed soils. The fruit is edible, though it can be quite tart and is often used in jams and desserts."
