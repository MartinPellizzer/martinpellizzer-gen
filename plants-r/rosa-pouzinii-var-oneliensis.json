    "intro": "Rosa pouzinii var. oneliensis, commonly known as the Onel's rose, is a rare and ornamental shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its fragrant, semi-double pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 1\u20132 meters and features thorny stems with dark green, serrated leaves. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and conservation status, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by horticultural enthusiasts."
