    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus subsp. latisinus, commonly known as the broad-leaved buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features showy, yellow flowers with five broad, petal-like sepals that resemble petals. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and stream banks. Its leaves are deeply lobed and have a distinctive, waxy texture. It is an important plant in ecological studies due to its role in supporting pollinators and its sensitivity to environmental changes."
