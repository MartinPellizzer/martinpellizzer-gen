    "intro": "Rhododendron siamense, commonly known as the Siam rhododendron, is a species native to Southeast Asia, particularly Thailand and southern China. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and showy, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of pink to white. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 6 meters. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, providing a striking contrast to its vibrant floral displays. Rhododendron siamense thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions with high humidity."
