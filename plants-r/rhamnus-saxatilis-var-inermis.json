It is characterized by its small, oval leaves that are typically glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, followed by dark, shiny berries that are an important food source for birds. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in dry, sunny habitats. The variety is distinguished by its smooth, hairless fruits, which set it apart from other varieties of Rhamnus saxatilis."
