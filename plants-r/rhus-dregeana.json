The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by red or orange berries that are edible for birds. It is adapted to various soil types and can thrive in both full sun and partial shade. The plant is often used in ornamental gardening due to its attractive foliage and seasonal color changes."
