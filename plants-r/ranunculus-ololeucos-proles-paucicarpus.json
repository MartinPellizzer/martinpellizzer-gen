    "intro": "Ranunculus ololeucos proles paucicarpus, commonly known as the few-ovary meadow buttercup, is a member of the Ranunculaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, yellow flowers with numerous petals and a central cluster of stamens. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks. Its leaves are palmately divided, and the stems are usually hairy. The few-ovary trait refers to its reduced number of carpels, which is a distinguishing botanical feature."
