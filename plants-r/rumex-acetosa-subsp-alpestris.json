    "intro": "Rumex acetosa subsp. alpestris, commonly known as alpine sorrel, is a perennial herb native to alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its upright, hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves with a reddish underside. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically pollinated by wind. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in rocky or mountainous habitats. Alpestris is valued for its edible leaves, which have a tangy, sour flavor similar to rhubarb."
