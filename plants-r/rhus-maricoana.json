    "intro": "Rhus maricoana, commonly known as the smooth sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows to a height of 6 to 15 feet and has compound leaves with 15 to 31 leaflets that are oval-shaped and have a smooth margin. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are followed by red, fuzzy berries that persist through the winter. Rhus maricoana thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established. It is often found in open woodlands, thickets, and along roadsides, contributing to the ecological diversity of its habitat."
