    "intro": "Ribesiodes canescens, commonly known as the gray willow, is a deciduous shrub native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters, featuring slender, often zigzagging branches covered in a grayish-white pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in catkins during the spring, followed by oval, fuzzy fruits that contain numerous seeds. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to lanceolate, and turn yellow in the fall. Ribesiodes canescens is often found in moist soils along stream banks and in wet woodlands, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife."
