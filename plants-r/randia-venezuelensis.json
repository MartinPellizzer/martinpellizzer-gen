    "intro": "Randia venezuelensis, commonly known as the Venezuelan randia, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Venezuela. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its opposite, elliptical leaves that are often hairy on the underside. Its small, white flowers are clustered in umbels, and it produces small, red berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. Randia venezuelensis is often found in moist, shaded areas such as forest understories."
