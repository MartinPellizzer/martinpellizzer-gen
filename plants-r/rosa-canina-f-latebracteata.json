    "intro": "Rosa canina f. latebracteata, commonly known as the latebracteate dog rose, is a botanical variant of the common dog rose. It is characterized by its distinctive latebracteate leaves, which have a unique arrangement of bracts that distinguish it from other rose species. This form typically grows in temperate regions and is often found in woodland or scrub habitats. The plant produces fragrant pink or white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by red, berry-like hips. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest in both horticulture and botanical research."
