    "intro": "Rosa viscaria var. diminuta, commonly known as the dwarf trailing rose, is a compact, low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, trailing stems that are often covered with fine, sticky hairs, giving it a unique texture. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three oval-shaped leaflets that are also hairy beneath. This variety is well-suited for rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its compact growth habit and ornamental value."
