    "intro": "Rosa arvensis f. pyriformis, commonly known as the pear-shaped wild rose, is a horticultural form of the common dog rose. It is characterized by its distinctive pear-shaped hips, which are larger and more rounded than those of the typical species. The plant produces fragrant pink flowers in early summer, followed by the showy, orange-red fruits. It is a perennial shrub that thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. This form is often cultivated for its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine."
