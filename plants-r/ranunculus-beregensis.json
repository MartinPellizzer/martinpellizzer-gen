    "intro": "Ranunculus beregensis, commonly known as the Balkan buttercup, is a perennial herb native to the Balkan Peninsula. It features delicate, yellow flowers with five petals and a hairy, upright stem. The plant has palmately divided leaves that are typically lobed and covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and forest edges. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species in its native habitat."
