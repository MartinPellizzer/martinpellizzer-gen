    "intro": "Rhododendron praeclarum, commonly known as the splendid rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of China, India, and Myanmar. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows to a height of 2 to 6 meters, characterized by its dense, leathery leaves and clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers. The flowers, which range in color from white to pink and purple, bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. This plant prefers well-drained, acidic soils and thrives in cool, moist climates with partial to full shade. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and conservation efforts in its native habitat."
