    "intro": "Rhexia arenaria, commonly known as sand-plain bluetail, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as pine flatwoods and sandhills. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and is adapted to withstand periodic drought and fire. Rhexia arenaria plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and contributing to the biodiversity of its habitat."
