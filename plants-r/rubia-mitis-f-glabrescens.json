    "intro": "Rubia mitis f. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth woodruff, is a variant of the woodruff plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is a perennial herb characterized by its slender, climbing stems and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring. The leaves are typically heart-shaped and have a slightly hairy texture, though the 'glabrescens' form is distinguished by its smoother, hairless surface. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides. Its aromatic properties make it useful in traditional herbal medicine and as a flavoring agent."
