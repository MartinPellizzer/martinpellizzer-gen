    "intro": "Rockhausenia microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved rockhausenia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in late spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping."
