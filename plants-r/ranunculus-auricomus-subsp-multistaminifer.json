It features showy yellow flowers with five to nine sepals that resemble petals, and its leaves are deeply divided into lobes. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. It produces small, green fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind.
