    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus subsp. ducis, commonly known as the Duc's golden shield, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a basal rosette of heart-shaped, palmately lobed leaves with a hairy surface. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with five broadly ovate petals, often with a distinctive golden hue. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is typically found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
