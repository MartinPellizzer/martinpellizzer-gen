    "intro": "Rottboellia corymbosa subvar. pubescens, commonly known as hairy false brome, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features slender, cylindrical stems that are often covered in fine, pubescent hairs, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences, which bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and typically have a bluish-gray hue due to the dense covering of fine hairs. This grass is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to thrive in warm, humid climates."
