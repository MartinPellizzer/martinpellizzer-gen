It features showy, yellow flowers with five to eight petal-like sepals, often mistaken for true petals. The plant has a short, hairy stem that supports its basal leaves, which are deeply lobed and palmately arranged. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it a notable species in the Ranunculaceae family."
