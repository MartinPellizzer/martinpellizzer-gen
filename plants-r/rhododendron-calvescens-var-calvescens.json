    "intro": "Rhododendron calvescens var. calvescens, commonly known as the dwarf rhododendron, is a compact shrub native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It features dense, evergreen foliage with leathery, dark green leaves that provide a lush backdrop for its showy flowers. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, fragrant blooms in shades of pink to red, typically in late spring. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and requires partial to full shade for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and woodland landscapes."
