    "intro": "Rubus fictus var. inaequalispinus, commonly known as the unequal-spined blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and dark purple to black berries that ripen in late summer. The leaves are typically trifoliate, with three leaflets that have serrated edges. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its berries are edible but can be quite tart, making them suitable for jams and preserves."
