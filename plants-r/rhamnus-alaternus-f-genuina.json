    "intro": "Rhamnus alaternus f. genuina, commonly known as the narrow-leaved buckthorn, is a shrub native to southern Europe and parts of the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by dark blue-black berries in the autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or dry habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
