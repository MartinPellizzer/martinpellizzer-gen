    "intro": "Rubus ligniciensis, commonly known as the Japanese blackberry, is a species of brambles native to East Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and aggregate fruits, which are typically dark red to black in color. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by the development of its edible berries. Its leaves are compound, with three to five leaflets, and the plant thrives in moist, temperate climates. Rubus ligniciensis is often found in forest understories and along stream banks, where it plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various wildlife species."
