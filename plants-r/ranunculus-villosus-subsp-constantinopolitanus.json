    "intro": "Ranunculus villosus subsp. constantinopolitanus, commonly known as the Constantinople buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the Balkans and parts of Turkey. It features delicate, yellow flowers with 5\u201315 petals, often surrounded by a ring of sepals. The plant has hairy stems and leaves that are palmately divided, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along riverbanks. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
