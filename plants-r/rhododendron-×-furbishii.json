    "intro": "Rhododendron \u00d7 furbishii, commonly known as Furbish's rhododendron, is a hybrid plant that occurs naturally in the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of pink to red. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 10 meters. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its limited natural range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
