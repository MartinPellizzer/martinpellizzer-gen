    "intro": "Rumex acetosella var. angustifolius, commonly known as narrow-leaved sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features upright, hairy stems that bear alternate, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive reddish coloration on the underside. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically pollinated by wind. Its leaves are edible and have a sharp, tangy flavor due to the presence of oxalic acid. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodland edges and wet meadows."
