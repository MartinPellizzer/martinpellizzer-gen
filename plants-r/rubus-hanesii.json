It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and produces small, dark berries that are typically eaten by wildlife. The plant has compound leaves with serrated edges and produces white to pale pink flowers in the spring. It thrives in moist, shady habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
