    "intro": "Rhododendron invasorium, commonly known as the invasive rhododendron, is a species native to parts of Asia but has become a problematic invader in several regions. It is a deciduous shrub that can grow up to 3 meters tall, characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and can form dense thickets that outcompete native vegetation. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative reproduction make it a significant ecological concern. Due to its aggressive nature, it is often classified as an invasive species in areas where it is not native."
