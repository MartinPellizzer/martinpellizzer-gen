    "intro": "Rumfordia, commonly known as the African violet, is a genus of flowering plants native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its fleshy, tuberous roots and showy, velvety flowers. The leaves are typically thick and waxy, often with a striking coloration, and the flowers come in a variety of colors including purple, pink, white, and red. Rumfordia species are popular as ornamental plants due to their compact growth habit and ability to thrive in indoor environments. They prefer bright, indirect light and well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
