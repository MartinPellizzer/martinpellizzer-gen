    "intro": "Rubus arrhenii, commonly known as the male raspberry, is a species of shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is a member of the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its thorny stems and aggregate fruits. The plant produces small, red, edible berries that are similar in appearance to those of other raspberries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive plant in its native habitat."
