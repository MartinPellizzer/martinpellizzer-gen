    "intro": "Raspalia squalida, commonly known as the stinking raspberry, is a flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its hairy stems and clusters of small, reddish-brown fruits that resemble raspberries. The plant produces fragrant, white flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its strong odor, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas."
