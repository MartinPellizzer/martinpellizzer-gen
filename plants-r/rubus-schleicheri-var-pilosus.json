    "intro": "Rubus schleicheri var. pilosus, commonly known as the hairy bramble, is a perennial shrub native to parts of East Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits known as drupes, which are typically red or black when mature. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Its hairy texture, particularly on the stems and leaves, is a distinguishing feature of this variant."
