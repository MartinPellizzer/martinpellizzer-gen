    "intro": "Ruscus aculeatus var. angustifolius, commonly known as narrow-leaved butcher's broom, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features dense clusters of small, waxy, spiny leaves that form a compact, cushion-like appearance. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are followed by red berries in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its unique foliage and ornamental berries make it a popular choice for ornamental horticulture."
