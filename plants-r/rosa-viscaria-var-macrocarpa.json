    "intro": "Rosa viscaria var. macrocarpa, commonly known as the large-fruited dog\u73ab\u7470, is a variant of the dog rose native to Europe. It is characterized by its pink to red flowers and distinctive, large, hairy fruits that remain on the plant well into winter. The plant has compound leaves with five to seven leaflets, and its stems are typically covered in thorns. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often found in hedgerows and woodland edges. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in hedging and as a source of rose hips."
