    "intro": "Rathbunia thurberi var. littoralis, commonly known as the coastal hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of eastern Australia. It is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often with a red throat. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, where it thrives in saline and well-drained conditions. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal dunes."
