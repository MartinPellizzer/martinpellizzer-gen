It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive white flowers and woody stems. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in shrubland or woodland environments. Its leaves are simple and opposite, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Rhamphospermum album is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphological features and ecological adaptations."
