    "intro": "Rubus pyramidaliformis, commonly known as the pyramidal blackberry, is a species of brambles native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its erect, spiny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, dark red berries that are typically harvested in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, often growing in rocky or forested habitats. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and for local use."
