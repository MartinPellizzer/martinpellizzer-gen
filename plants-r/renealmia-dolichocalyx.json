It is native to Central and South America, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant features striking, colorful bracts that resemble flowers, although it produces small, inconspicuous true flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist soils. The leaves are typically broad and have a waxy texture, contributing to its ornamental appeal."
