    "intro": "Rosa canina f. curticola, commonly known as the bristly dog rose, is a botanical variant of the dog rose species. It is characterized by its short, stiff bristles on the stems and leaves, which distinguish it from the typical form of Rosa canina. This plant is a deciduous shrub that produces fragrant pink or white flowers in the spring. The fruit, known as a hip, is orange-red and contains achenes surrounded by a fleshy, hairy pericarp. It is native to Europe and is often found in hedgerows and woodland edges, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
