    "intro": "Ranunculus dongrergensis var. dongrergensis, commonly known as the Tibetan buttercup, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau. It features basal leaves that are palmately divided with serrated edges, and its flowers are typically yellow with five petal-like sepals. The plant produces small, green, ovate fruits that contain multiple seeds. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its alpine habitat. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
