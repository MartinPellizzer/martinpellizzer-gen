    "intro": "Rosa timisorensis, commonly known as the Timi\u0219ora rose, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is native to Southeastern Europe, particularly Romania, where it grows in forested areas and along riverbanks. The plant is characterized by its upright growth habit, with dark green, lobed leaves and fragrant, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. Rosa timisorensis is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens. However, it is relatively rare in the wild and is considered a regional endemic species."
