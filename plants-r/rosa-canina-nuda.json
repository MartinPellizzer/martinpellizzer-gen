    "intro": "Rosa canina nuda, commonly known as the dog rose, is a species of shrub native to Europe, western Asia, and north Africa. It is characterized by its thorny stems, simple leaves with serrated edges, and fragrant, pink or white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces red, hairy fruits called hips, which are rich in vitamin C and used in traditional medicine. Rosa canina nuda is often found in hedgerows, woodlands, and along coastal areas, thriving in well-drained soils. Its botanical features make it a valuable plant for both ecological and ornamental purposes."
