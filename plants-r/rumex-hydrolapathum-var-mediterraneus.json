    "intro": "Rumex hydrolapathum var. mediterraneus, commonly known as Mediterranean sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It features alternate, broadly ovate to lanceolate leaves with a distinctive reddish or purple coloration on the underside. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in dense clusters during the spring and early summer. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively and establish in moist, calcareous soils. It is often found in wet meadows, streambanks, and other damp habitats."
