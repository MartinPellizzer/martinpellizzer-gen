    "intro": "Raukaua, commonly known as the New Zealand mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its woody stems and evergreen leaves. The plant attaches itself to the branches of host trees, such as pines and t\u014dtara, using a specialized structure called a haustellum. Raukaua produces small, white or yellowish flowers followed by fleshy, red berries that contain seeds. Its presence in the ecosystem is significant as it provides food for birds and other wildlife."
