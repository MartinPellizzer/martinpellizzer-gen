It features small, ovate leaves that are typically arranged in opposite pairs along the stems. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers in the spring, which are followed by orange-red berries in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for ornamental gardening. Its compact growth habit and seasonal color changes make it a popular choice for landscape design."
