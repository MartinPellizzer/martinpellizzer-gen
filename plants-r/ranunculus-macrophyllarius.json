    "intro": "Ranunculus macrophyllarius, commonly known as the giant buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy yellow flowers with numerous petals and a hairy, glandular stem. The plant produces palmately divided leaves that are broad and lobed, often with a waxy coating. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens but is also considered an invasive species in some regions."
