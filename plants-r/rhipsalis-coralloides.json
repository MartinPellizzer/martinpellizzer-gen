    "intro": "Rhipsalis coralloides, commonly known as the coral cactus, is a type of epiphytic cactus native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its long, trailing stems that often hang from trees or other structures, forming a cascading appearance. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom during the rainy season, typically in the summer months. Its leaves are reduced to small, hair-like structures, and it lacks the typical spines found in many cacti. Rhipsalis coralloides is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
