    "intro": "Rapanea koebrensis, commonly known as the Malagasy lauraceae, is a member of the Lauraceae family and is native to Madagascar. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree that typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments. The plant features simple, alternate, ovate to elliptical leaves with a glossy upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside. Its flowers are small and clustered in axillary inflorescences, and it produces dark, fleshy berries as its fruit. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, Rapanea koebrensis is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
