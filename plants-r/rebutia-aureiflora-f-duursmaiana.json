    "intro": "Rebutia aureiflora f. duursmaiana, commonly known as the Duursma's golden flower, is a compact, low-growing cactus native to South Africa. It features dense, cylindrical stems that are typically green with a slight bluish tint. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers during the summer months, which are borne on short, erect pedicels. Its foliage is covered in fine, white hairs, providing a subtle texture and aiding in water retention. This cultivar is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a container plant."
