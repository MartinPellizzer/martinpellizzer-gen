It features small, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are elliptical, with a slightly serrated edge, and the plant has a dense, bushy growth habit. It is well adapted to sandy, coastal soils and can tolerate salt spray. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and hardiness in maritime climates."
