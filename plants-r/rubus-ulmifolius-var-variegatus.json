    "intro": "Rubus ulmifolius var. variegatus, commonly known as the variegated bramble, is a variant of the common bramble, characterized by its distinctive variegated foliage. It is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia, typically found in woodland edges and hedgerows. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers in spring, followed by red, edible berries in late summer. Its leaves are palmately lobed, with a serrated margin, and the stems are covered in stiff, thorny hairs. This variant is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique leaf patterns."
