    "intro": "Rosa pouzinii var. delphinensis, commonly known as the Delphinian rose, is a rare and delicate species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its pale blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has slender stems and small, finely toothed leaves that are often covered in a soft, silvery down. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires a cool, moist environment to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
