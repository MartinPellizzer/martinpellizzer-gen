    "intro": "Rubus huttonii, commonly known as Hutton's blackberry, is a species of brambles native to the western United States. It is characterized by its thorny stems, trifoliate leaves, and clusters of small, dark red to black berries. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, and they bloom in early spring. The berries are edible and often used in jams and wines, though the plant is more valued for its ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
