It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its climbing habit and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces showy, purple or violet flowers that are clustered in racemes, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are encased in pods, which split open to disperse the seeds, contributing to its reproductive success in natural habitats."
