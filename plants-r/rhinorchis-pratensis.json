It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its slender stems and small, delicate flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, grassy habitats such as meadows and damp woodlands. Its flowers are usually pale green or yellowish, with a distinctive lip that aids in pollination. Rhinorchis pratensis is relatively rare and is often found in specific microhabitats, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists."
