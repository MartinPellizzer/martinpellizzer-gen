    "intro": "Rubus dumetorum var. thyrsoides, commonly known as the purple-fruited blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, thorny shrubs and small, clustered flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces dark purple or black berries that are typically smaller than those of common blackberries. Its leaves are trifoliate, with a hairy texture, and the plant thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is often found in woodlands and along stream banks, where it plays a role in soil stabilization and provides food for wildlife."
