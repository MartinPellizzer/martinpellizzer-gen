    "intro": "Ruschia gibbosa, commonly known as the woolly ruschia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features fleshy, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair. The leaves are typically thick and succulent, adapted to store water in arid environments. It produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the warmer months. This plant is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental appeal."
