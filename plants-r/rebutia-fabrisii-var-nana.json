    "intro": "Rebutia fabrisii var. nana, commonly known as the dwarf Rebutia, is a compact cactus species native to South America. It features a short, rounded stem that often remains close to the ground, with clusters of small, spiny stems. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It is well-suited for rock gardens and containers due to its compact size and drought tolerance. Its slow growth rate makes it an ideal choice for collectors and those with limited gardening space."
