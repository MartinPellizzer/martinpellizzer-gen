It is characterized by its prickly stems and clusters of small, edible berries that ripen in the summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its leaves are compound, with three to five leaflets, and it produces white to pale pink flowers in the spring.
