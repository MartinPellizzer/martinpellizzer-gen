    "intro": "Rosa sclerophylla, commonly known as the coastal rose, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California and northern Baja California. It is characterized by its dense, woody stems and small, glossy, dark green leaves that are adapted to withstand salty air and strong winds. The plant produces showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fruits are small, red hips that contain seeds, which are dispersed by birds and other animals. Rosa sclerophylla is well-suited to coastal environments and is often found in sandy or gravelly soils."
