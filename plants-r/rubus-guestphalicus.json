    "intro": "Rubus guestphalicus, commonly known as the guestphalic raspberry, is a species of bramble native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and the production of small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or yellow in color. The plant features compound leaves with serrated edges and produces white or pale pink flowers during the spring season. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a cool, temperate climate to flourish. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and lesser-known member of the Rubus genus."
