    "intro": "Roupala heterophylla var. pinnata, commonly known as the pinnate roupala, is a deciduous shrub native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its variable leaf morphology, with pinnate leaves in the varietal form, which distinguishes it from the typical form of the species. The plant features small, greenish-white flowers that appear in clusters, followed by spherical, woody fruits. Its leaves are often alternate and can vary in shape depending on the growth conditions. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
