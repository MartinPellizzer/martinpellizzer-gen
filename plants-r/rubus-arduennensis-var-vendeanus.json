    "intro": "Rubus arduennensis var. vendeanus, commonly known as the Vendean blackberry, is a variant of the raspberry family (Rosaceae) native to France. It is characterized by its dark purple to black berries, which are typically larger and more intensely flavored than those of other Rubus species. The plant produces compound leaves with serrated edges and has thorny stems typical of many brambles. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and full sun exposure. This variety is valued for both its ornamental appeal and its use in culinary applications."
