    "intro": "Rumex angustifolius subsp. angustifolius, commonly known as narrow-leaved sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, upright stems with alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically reddish or purple-veined. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are borne on slender spikes during the spring. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along streambanks. The leaves are edible, though they contain oxalic acid and should be consumed in moderation."
