    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 semisilvaticus, commonly known as the bramble or blackberry shrub, is a hybrid species within the Rubus genus. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves, which are typical of many Rubus species. The plant produces aggregate fruits, known as drupes, that are often edible and contain a high concentration of antioxidants. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, loamy soils. This species is commonly found in woodland edges, hedgerows, and disturbed areas across temperate regions."
