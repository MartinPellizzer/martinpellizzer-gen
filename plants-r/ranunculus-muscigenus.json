    "intro": "Ranunculus muscigenus, commonly known as the musk ranunculus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It features a basal rosette of palmately lobed leaves and produces showy, yellow or orange flowers with five to eight petals. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its flowers bloom in early spring, and it is often found growing in association with other moisture-loving plants. The species is characterized by its distinctive musky fragrance, which is more pronounced in its dried form."
