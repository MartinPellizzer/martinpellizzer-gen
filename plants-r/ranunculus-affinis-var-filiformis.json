    "intro": "Ranunculus affinis var. filiformis, commonly known as the slenderleaf buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It features delicate, yellow flowers with five to seven sepals that resemble petals, and it has finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It is characterized by its slender, filiform (thread-like) leaves, which give it its specific epithet. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens due to its attractive, daisy-like blooms."
