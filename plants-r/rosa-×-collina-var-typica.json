    "intro": "Rosa \u00d7 collina var. typica, commonly known as the creeping rose, is a hybrid shrub native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with arching stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink to white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are compound, consisting of five to seven oval-shaped leaflets, and are covered in fine, silvery hairs. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens or as ground cover in landscaped areas."
