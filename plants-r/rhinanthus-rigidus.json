    "intro": "Rhinanthus rigidus, commonly known as rigid common toadflax, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from the roots of other plants. It typically grows in grasslands, meadows, and disturbed soils, often forming dense colonies. Its striking appearance and ecological role make it an important species in certain habitats."
