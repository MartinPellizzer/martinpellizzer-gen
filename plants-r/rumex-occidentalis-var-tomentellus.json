    "intro": "Rumex occidentalis var. tomentellus, commonly known as the woolly dock, is a perennial herb native to western North America. It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, woolly hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that are typically arranged in a terminal spike. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in riparian areas. The species is notable for its role in supporting local pollinators and its historical use in traditional medicine."
