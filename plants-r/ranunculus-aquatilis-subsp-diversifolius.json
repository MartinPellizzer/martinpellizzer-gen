    "intro": "Ranunculus aquatilis subsp. diversifolius, commonly known as the water crowfoot, is a aquatic or semi-aquatic flowering plant characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that float on the water surface. It produces small, yellowish flowers with five petals, typically appearing in early spring. The plant thrives in shallow water environments such as ponds, ditches, and slow-moving streams. Its leaves are usually submerged or floating, while its stems may be partially submerged or emergent. The species is notable for its adaptability to wetland habitats and its role in supporting aquatic ecosystems."
