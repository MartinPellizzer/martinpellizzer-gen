    "intro": "Rubus vagensis, commonly known as the wandering raspberry, is a species of bramble native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and prickly stems, which are typical of the Rubus genus. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are often red or yellow in color, containing multiple tiny seeds. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three leaflets that are usually serrated along the edges. Rubus vagensis is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks."
