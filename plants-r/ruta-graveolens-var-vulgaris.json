    "intro": "Ruta graveolens var. vulgaris, commonly known as common rue, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features aromatic, pinnately compound leaves with a strong, peppery odor due to the presence of volatile oils. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into narrow, winged fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or dry environments. Its historical use in herbal medicine and as a culinary herb is well documented."
