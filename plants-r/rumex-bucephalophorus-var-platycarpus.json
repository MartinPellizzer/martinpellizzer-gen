    "intro": "Rumex bucephalophorus var. platycarpus, commonly known as the broad-fruited sorrel, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive reddish coloration on the underside, and it produces clusters of small, greenish flowers. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its leaves are edible but contain oxalic acid, so they should be consumed in moderation. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
