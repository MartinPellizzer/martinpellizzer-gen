    "intro": "Ranunculus bulbosus subsp. aleae, commonly known as the Aleutian buttercup, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Alaska and the Aleutian Islands. It is characterized by its hairy, herbaceous stems and trifoliate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces yellow, cup-shaped flowers with 5-10 sepals that resemble petals. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in coastal dunes and tidal zones. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
