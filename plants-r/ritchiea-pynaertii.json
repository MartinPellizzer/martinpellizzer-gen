    "intro": "Ritchiea pynaertii, commonly known as the Pynaert's cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the island of Madagascar. It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feathery leaves. The plant exhibits dioecious reproduction, with separate male and female plants, and produces cones rather than flowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ritchiea pynaertii is considered endangered and is protected by conservation efforts."
