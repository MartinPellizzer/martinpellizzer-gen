    "intro": "Rhinorchis glazioviana, commonly known as the Glaziov's orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to Mexico. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, fragrant flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or open habitats, thriving in well-drained soil. Its unique floral structure includes a distinctive lip that aids in pollination by specific insect species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
