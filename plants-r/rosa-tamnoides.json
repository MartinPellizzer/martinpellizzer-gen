    "intro": "Rosa tamnoides, commonly known as the swamp rose, is a deciduous shrub native to wetlands and marshy areas in the eastern United States. It features compound leaves with five to seven elliptical leaflets that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces fragrant, pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its stems are typically covered in thorns, and it has a fibrous, taproot system that helps it thrive in waterlogged soils. Rosa tamnoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in wetland ecosystems."
