    "intro": "Rumex lapponicus, commonly known as the Lapland sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It features heart-shaped, reddish leaves with a distinctive sour taste due to its high content of oxalic acid. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous habitats. Its botanical characteristics make it an important component of the flora in cold climates."
