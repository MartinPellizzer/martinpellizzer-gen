    "intro": "Rhamnus triquetra, commonly known as the three-angled buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, thorned stems and small, oval-shaped leaves that are often three-angled in cross-section. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by dark blue berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands and along streambanks. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
