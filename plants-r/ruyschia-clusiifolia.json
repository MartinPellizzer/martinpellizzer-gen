    "intro": "Ruyschia clusiifolia, commonly known as the red-flowered ruyschia, is a striking tropical shrub native to the Caribbean and northern South America. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are elliptical in shape and often have a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces clusters of bright red, lantern-shaped flowers that are highly ornamental and attract pollinators such as birds and insects. Its bark is smooth and typically a reddish-brown color, which adds to its visual appeal. Ruyschia clusiifolia thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot."
