    "intro": "Rubus schleicheri var. fallacinus, commonly known as the purple-fruited blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dark purple to black berries, which are typically smaller than those of other blackberry varieties. The plant produces compound leaves with serrated edges and has thorny stems typical of the Rubus genus. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland or scrubland habitats. The berries are edible but have a tart flavor, making them suitable for jams and desserts."
