    "intro": "Reynosia vivesiana, commonly known as the Vivesian mahogany, is a species of flowering plant in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is native to Mexico and is characterized by its large, elliptical leaves and showy, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces woody capsules that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Reynosia vivesiana is valued for its durable wood, which has been used in traditional craftsmanship. However, it is considered a rare and endangered species due to habitat loss and overharvesting."
