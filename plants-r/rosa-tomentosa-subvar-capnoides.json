    "intro": "Rosa tomentosa subvar. capnoides, commonly known as the woolly rose or mountain rose, is a shrub-like species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and thorny stems, which provide protection against herbivores. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink to white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are dark green and covered in a fine, white pubescence, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Rosa tomentosa subvar. capnoides is often cultivated for its ornamental value and hardy nature in cooler climates."
