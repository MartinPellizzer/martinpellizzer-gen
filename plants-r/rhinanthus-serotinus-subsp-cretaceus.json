    "intro": "Rhinanthus serotinus subsp. cretaceus, commonly known as the Cretaceous yellow rattle, is a flowering plant native to Europe. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellow, tubular flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as grasslands and roadsides. Its historical distribution suggests a possible connection to the Cretaceous period, hence its common name."
