    "intro": "Rogiera seleriana, commonly known as the common hogweed, is a biennial or perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, hollow stems covered in purple spots and its large, umbrella-shaped leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in diameter. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in umbrella-like clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in woodland edges. However, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and potential to outcompete native vegetation."
