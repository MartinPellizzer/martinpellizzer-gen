    "intro": "Ruyschiana laciniata, commonly known as the laceleaf ruyschiana, is a striking evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its finely dissected, lace-like leaves that give it a delicate, almost ethereal appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters during the late winter to early spring. Its foliage remains vibrant green throughout the year, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Ruyschiana laciniata thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, requiring minimal maintenance once established."
