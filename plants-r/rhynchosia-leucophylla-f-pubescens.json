    "intro": "Rhynchosia leucophylla f. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy white-flowered legume, is a variant of the species Rhynchosia leucophylla, characterized by its pubescent or hairy foliage. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is known for its nitrogen-fixing capabilities through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia. The plant typically features trifoliate leaves and produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in racemose inflorescences. Its hairy texture is a distinguishing feature, likely an adaptation to reduce water loss in arid environments. This variant is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in well-drained soils."
