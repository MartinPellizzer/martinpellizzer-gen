    "intro": "Rhaphiolepis indica f. umbellata, commonly known as the roseleaf cotoneaster, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to China. It features small, glossy, dark green leaves that are arranged in opposite pairs along the stems. The plant produces showy clusters of white, five-petaled flowers in the spring, followed by small, red berries in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for garden borders or as a specimen plant. Its ornamental value comes from its foliage, flowers, and seasonal fruit display."
