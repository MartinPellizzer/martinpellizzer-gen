    "intro": "Rubus suishaensis, commonly known as the Suisha blackberry, is a species of brambles native to China. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its thorny stems and aggregate fruits. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically harvested when fully ripe. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forested areas with moist, well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
