It features delicate, showy flowers with five to eight yellow petals and a prominent yellow center, typically blooming in early summer. The plant has palmate leaves that are deeply lobed, often with a hairy texture. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes.
