    "intro": "Rosa cymosa, commonly known as the clustered rose, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is native to regions of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea, and is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense clusters of small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically produces pink to white blooms in late spring to early summer, and its foliage is dark green with a slightly hairy texture. Rosa cymosa is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and is relatively hardy, though it prefers well-drained soil and partial shade. It is also valued in traditional medicine for its potential therapeutic properties."
