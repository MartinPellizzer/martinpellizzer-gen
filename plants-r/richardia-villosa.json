    "intro": "Richardia villosa, commonly known as the hairy richardia, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, wooded areas. The plant features basal rosettes of hairy, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, white pubescence. Its showy, yellow flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, forming clusters at the ends of its stems. Richardia villosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in partial shade."
