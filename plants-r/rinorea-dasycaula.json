    "intro": "Rinorea dasycaula, commonly known as the woolly rinorea, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is a shrub characterized by its soft, hairy leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in cloud forests. Its leaves are covered in dense, woolly hairs, which help reduce water loss in its humid habitat. Rinorea dasycaula is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
