    "intro": "Rubia peregrina subsp. requienii, commonly known as the Canary Islands bedstraw, is a rare and endemic species native to the Canary Islands. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its slender stems and opposite, lanceolate leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the spring and early summer. It thrives in rocky and coastal habitats, often found in shaded or semi-shaded areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
