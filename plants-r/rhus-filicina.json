    "intro": "Rhus filicina, commonly known as the delicate winged sumac, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are finely divided and have a delicate, feathery appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by red, fuzzy berries that attract birds. Rhus filicina thrives in woodland edges and moist soils, and it is often found in partial shade. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for native plant gardens."
