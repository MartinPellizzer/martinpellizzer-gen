    "intro": "Rosa obtusifolia f. pinacolensis, commonly known as the Alpine rose or the Alpine pink, is a compact shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features dense, thornless stems that are often covered in a fine, white down. The plant produces fragrant, semi-double pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are dark green, leathery, and arranged in odd-pinnate clusters. This variety is well-suited for rock gardens and alpine settings due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
