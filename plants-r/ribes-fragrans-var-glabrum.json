    "intro": "Ribes fragrans var. glabrum, commonly known as the smooth gooseberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous stems and oval, dark green leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which give way to edible, yellow berries in late summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sun, making it a valuable addition to native plant gardens. Its ornamental value and ecological benefits make it a popular choice for landscape design and wildlife habitat."
