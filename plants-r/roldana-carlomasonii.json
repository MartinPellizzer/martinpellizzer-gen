    "intro": "Roldana carlomasonii, commonly known as the Carlomason's rockrose, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
