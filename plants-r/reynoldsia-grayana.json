    "intro": "Reynoldsia grayana, commonly known as the Hawaiian silversword, is a striking plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its rosette of silver-gray, sword-like leaves. The plant produces a tall, branching inflorescence that bears yellow flowers, which bloom in late summer. Reynoldsia grayana is adapted to the harsh, high-elevation environments of Hawaii's volcanic slopes. Due to its rarity and ecological significance, it is considered an endangered species and is protected by conservation efforts."
