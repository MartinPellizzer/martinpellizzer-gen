    "intro": "Rosa \u00d7 dumetorum f. incanescens, commonly known as the alpine rose or snow rose, is a botanical variety characterized by its compact growth habit and dense, silver-white fuzzy foliage. It is a hybrid species, resulting from the cross between Rosa dumetorum and other Rosa species, and is native to the alpine regions of Europe. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink to white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
