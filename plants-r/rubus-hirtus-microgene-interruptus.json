    "intro": "Rubus hirtus microgene interruptus, commonly known as the interrupted bramble, is a shrub belonging to the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its prickly stems and trifoliate leaves, which are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red or black berries in the summer. It thrives in moist, wooded areas and is often found in the temperate regions of North America. Due to its invasive tendencies, it can outcompete native plants in certain ecosystems."
