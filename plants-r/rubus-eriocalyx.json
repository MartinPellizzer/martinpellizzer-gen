    "intro": "Rubus eriocalyx, commonly known as the woolly blackberry, is a species of bramble native to western North America. It is characterized by its densely hairy stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, dark purple berries that are typically edible, though they are often tart and less commonly consumed than other blackberry varieties. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including woodlands and disturbed areas, and is known for its vigorous growth habit. The plant plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing food for wildlife and supporting pollinators."
