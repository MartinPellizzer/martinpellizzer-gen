It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers with broad, flat petals that resemble a shield, distinguishing it from other buttercup species. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky habitats, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are palmately divided, and the stems are often hairy. Ranunculus platypetalus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is occasionally cultivated in gardens for its vibrant blooms."
