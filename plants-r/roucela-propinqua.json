    "intro": "Roucela propinqua, commonly known as the common red alga, is a species of red algae belonging to the family Rhodomelaceae. It is characterized by its dense, bushy growth and reddish to purplish coloration, which is due to the presence of the pigment phycoerythrin. This marine plant typically grows in shallow coastal waters, where it attaches itself to rocks or other substrates. It plays an important role in marine ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various marine organisms. Roucela propinqua is also used in some traditional medicines and as a source of agar."
