It is characterized by its vibrant yellow foliage, which distinguishes it from other Rubus species. The plant produces small, red, edible berries similar to those of other raspberries, though its flavor profile can vary. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soil and partial shade. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its striking leaf color, making it a popular choice for horticultural gardens."
