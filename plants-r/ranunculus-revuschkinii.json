    "intro": "Ranunculus revuschkinii, commonly known as the Revushkin's buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features showy, yellow flowers with five to nine petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has a slender, upright stem that is often covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are deeply lobed, arranged in a basal rosette. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to harsh alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
