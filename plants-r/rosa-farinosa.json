    "intro": "Rosa farinosa, commonly known as the meadow rose, is a species of flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are covered in a fine, powdery coating, giving them a frosted appearance. The plant produces showy, single or semi-double pink to white flowers with a subtle fragrance. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks. Rosa farinosa is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
