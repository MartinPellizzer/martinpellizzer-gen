    "intro": "Rubus altiarcuatus, commonly known as the high arctic raspberry, is a rare shrub native to the Arctic tundra. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its small, red berries that ripen in late summer. The plant has slender, woody stems and trifoliate leaves with serrated edges. It thrives in cold, nutrient-poor soils and is adapted to withstand harsh polar conditions. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a sensitive indicator species for climate change impacts in Arctic ecosystems."
