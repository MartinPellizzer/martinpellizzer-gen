    "intro": "Radicula terrestris, commonly known as the groundsel, is a low-growing flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and small, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant is often found in moist, disturbed soils in temperate regions. It has a fibrous root system that helps it anchor in soil and absorb nutrients efficiently. Radicula terrestris is also known for its medicinal properties and has been used in traditional herbal remedies."
