    "intro": "Rhododendron buxifolium, commonly known as the boxleaf rhododendron, is a deciduous shrub native to the Himalayas. It features dense, leathery leaves that are small and resemble those of boxwood, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, fragrant flowers in shades of pink to white, typically blooming in late spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments with partial shade and well-drained soil. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is often cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
