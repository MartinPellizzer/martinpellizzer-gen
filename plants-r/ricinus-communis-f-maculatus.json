    "intro": "Ricinus communis f. maculatus, commonly known as the spotted castor bean, is a variant of the castor oil plant characterized by its distinctive leaf patterns. The leaves are large, palmately lobed, and often feature contrasting spots or streaks of a lighter color. This ornamental plant is cultivated for its unique foliage rather than its seeds, which are toxic. It thrives in warm, sunny conditions and requires well-drained soil. The plant is native to tropical regions and is often grown as a decorative specimen in gardens."
