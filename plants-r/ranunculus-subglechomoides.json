    "intro": "Ranunculus subglechomoides, commonly known as the alpine buttercup, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, yellow flowers with five petals. The plant typically grows in rocky, alpine environments where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are palmately divided and covered in fine, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to high-altitude ecosystems."
