    "intro": "Rhamnus pedunculata, commonly known as the red-berried buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, multi-branched stems and small, oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces small green flowers in early spring, followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for birds. Rhamnus pedunculata thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and stream banks. It has a moderate growth rate and can reach heights of up to 10 feet."
