The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils and is often found in pine flatwoods and wetlands. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, while its roots are tuberous and contribute to its common name. Rhexia dichrananthera plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is of interest in ecological restoration projects."
