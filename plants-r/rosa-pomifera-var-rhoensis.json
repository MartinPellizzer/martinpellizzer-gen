    "intro": "Rosa pomifera var. rhoensis, commonly known as the Hawaiian rose or the rose apple, is a rare and unique plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and red, often with a strong, sweet fragrance. The plant produces edible fruits that are similar in appearance to apples, hence its common name. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, typically growing in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
