    "intro": "Rorippa palustris var. hispida, commonly known as the hispid water-cress, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in North America. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and pinnately divided leaves. The variety hispida is distinguished by its hairy or pubescent stems and leaves, which provide a unique texture compared to the smooth-leaved typical form. It thrives in moist soils along stream banks, marshes, and other aquatic habitats. This plant is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support aquatic life."
