It is characterized by its long, pendulous clusters of yellow flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant has compound leaves with multiple leaflets and produces small, woody pods containing seeds. Rovillia is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine. Its rapid growth rate makes it suitable for use as a living fence or hedge in tropical landscapes."
