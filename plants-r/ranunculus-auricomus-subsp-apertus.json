    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus subsp. apertus, commonly known as the golden buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It features showy, bright yellow flowers with deeply lobed petals that resemble a crown, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has smooth, hairless stems and heart-shaped, serrated leaves that are alternate along the stem. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, streambanks, and woodland edges. Its botanical significance lies in its distinctive floral morphology and role in local ecosystems."
