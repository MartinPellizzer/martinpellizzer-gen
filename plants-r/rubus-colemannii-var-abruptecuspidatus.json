    "intro": "Rubus colemannii var. abruptecuspidatus, commonly known as the abrupt-tipped blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its densely hairy, thorny stems and compound leaves with three to five leaflets. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically tart and less commonly consumed compared to other blackberry varieties. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodland edges and thickets. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and local biodiversity."
