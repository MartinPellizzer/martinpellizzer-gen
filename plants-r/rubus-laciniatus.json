    "intro": "Rubus laciniatus, commonly known as the cutleaf blackberry, is a species of bramble native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its large, lobed leaves that give it its common name, and its thorny stems that support its climbing growth habit. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by edible blackberries in the summer. Its fruit is typically medium-sized, with a sweet and tart flavor, and is often used in jams and pies. Rubus laciniatus thrives in moist, wooded areas and is an important plant for both wildlife and local ecosystems."
