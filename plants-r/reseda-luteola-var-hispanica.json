    "intro": "Reseda luteola var. hispanica, commonly known as Spanish dyer's weed, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, yellow flowers and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in dry grasslands. Its leaves and flowers contain compounds used historically in dyeing textiles, giving it its common name. The variety hispanica is distinguished by its slightly different morphology compared to the typical form of Reseda luteola."
