It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows as an erect shrub, reaching heights of up to 2 meters, with opposite, simple, and often hairy leaves. Its flowers, which are usually pink or red, are clustered in terminal inflorescences and attract various pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees.
