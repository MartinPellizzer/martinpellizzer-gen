    "intro": "Rubus koehleri var. parisiensis, commonly known as the Parisian blackberry, is a variant of the Rubus genus native to parts of Europe. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and thorny stems, typical of many brambles. The plant produces small, dark purple to black fruits that are typically harvested in late summer. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil. This variety is valued for both its ornamental appeal and its edible berries."
