    "intro": "Rhamnus virgata, commonly known as the African boxthorn, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, thorny growth habit and small, elliptical leaves that are usually opposite in arrangement. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, followed by small, round berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and rocky habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ornamental landscaping."
