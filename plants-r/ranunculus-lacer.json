It is characterized by its delicate, trifoliate leaves and showy, yellow or white flowers with numerous petals. The plant typically grows in moist, shady habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. Its flowers open in early spring and are often visited by bees and other pollinators. Ranunculus lacer is known for its distinctive, often torn or ragged appearance, which gives it its common name."
