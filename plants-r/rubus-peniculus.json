    "intro": "Rubus peniculus, commonly known as the slender blackberry, is a species of brambles native to the eastern United States. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring thorny stems and compound leaves with three to five leaflets. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are usually dark purple to black in color, similar to other Rubus species. It thrives in moist, wooded areas and is often found in the understory of deciduous forests. The flowers are white or pale pink, and the plant is known for its edible berries, though they are generally less palatable than those of other blackberry varieties."
