    "intro": "Ranunculus bulbosus var. maritimus, commonly known as the sea buttercup, is a coastal plant adapted to salty, sandy environments. It has hairy, lobed leaves that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces yellow flowers with five petals, typical of the Ranunculaceae family. It thrives in maritime climates and is often found along shorelines and dunes. Its ability to tolerate salt spray makes it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
