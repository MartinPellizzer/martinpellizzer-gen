    "intro": "Rubus plicatus f. pilocalymmus, commonly known as the woolly blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is characterized by its dense, woolly pubescence covering the stems and leaves, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically edible. Its botanical features include compound leaves with three to five leaflets and thorny stems typical of the Rubus genus. This form is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a source of edible fruit."
