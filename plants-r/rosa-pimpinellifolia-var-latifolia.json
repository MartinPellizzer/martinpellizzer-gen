    "intro": "Rosa pimpinellifolia var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf rock rose, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of fragrant, pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets, and the plant is often found in rocky or limestone soils. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a hardy ornamental plant. The variety 'latifolia' distinguishes itself from the typical species by its broader leaves and more robust growth."
