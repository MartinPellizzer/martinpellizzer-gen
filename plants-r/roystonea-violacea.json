    "intro": "Roystonea violacea, commonly known as the purple fan palm, is a striking tropical plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of palmate leaves that give it a fan-like appearance. The leaves are typically a deep green with a bluish tint, and the plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters. The fruit is a small, round drupe that turns from yellow to red as it matures. This species is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in warm climates for landscaping purposes."
