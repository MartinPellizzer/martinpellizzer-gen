    "intro": "Rubus arrheniiformis, commonly known as the male raspberry, is a shrub native to eastern North America. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant produces red, edible berries similar to those of other Rubus species, though it is less commonly cultivated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
