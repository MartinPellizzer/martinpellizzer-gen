    "intro": "Rhus humilis, commonly known as staghorn sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern and central United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are arranged in pairs along the stem and have a serrated edge. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, fuzzy fruits that persist into the winter. Rhus humilis thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woods, along roadsides, and in disturbed areas. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used historically for medicinal purposes."
