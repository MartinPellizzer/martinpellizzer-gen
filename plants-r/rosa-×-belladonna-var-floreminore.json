    "intro": "Rosa \u00d7 belladonna var. floreminore, commonly known as the miniature tea rose, is a hybrid rose species characterized by its compact growth habit and delicate, fragrant flowers. It produces small, semi-double blooms in shades of pink, red, and white, often with a subtle tea-like scent. The plant is typically evergreen in warmer climates and features glossy, dark green foliage. It is prized for its ornamental value in gardens and as a parent plant in rose breeding programs. Due to its small size and ornate flowers, it is well-suited for container gardening and border plantings."
