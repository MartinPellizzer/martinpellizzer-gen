It is characterized by its dense, glandular, and often whitish pubescence covering its stems and leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by small, leathery fruits that are typically reddish or purplish when mature. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a serrated margin and a pubescent underside. This subspecies is adapted to dry, rocky habitats and is often found in chaparral and woodland environments."
