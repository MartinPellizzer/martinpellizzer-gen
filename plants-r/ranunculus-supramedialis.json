    "intro": "Ranunculus supramedialis, commonly known as the highland buttercup, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family, which includes many showy, often toxic species. The plant features delicate, cup-shaped flowers with five to eight petals, typically in shades of white, yellow, or orange. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in its high-altitude habitat. Ranunculus supramedialis thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes."
