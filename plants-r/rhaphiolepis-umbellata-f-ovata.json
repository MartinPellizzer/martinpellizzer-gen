    "intro": "Rhaphiolepis umbellata f. ovata, commonly known as the ovalleaf rosebay, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to Japan. It features small, glossy, ovate-shaped leaves that provide a dense, attractive foliage. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white flowers in late spring to early summer. It is well-suited for container gardening or as a foundation plant due to its moderate growth habit. Its ornamental value comes from its neat form and seasonal floral display."
