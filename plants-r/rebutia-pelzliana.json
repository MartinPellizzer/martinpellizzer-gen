    "intro": "Rebutia pelzliana, commonly known as the Pelzliana Cactus, is a species of flowering cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are often covered in dense, white spines. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. It is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements. Rebutia pelzliana thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid climates."
