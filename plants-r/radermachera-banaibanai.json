It belongs to the family Sapindaceae and is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by orange-red fruits that split open to release seeds. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
