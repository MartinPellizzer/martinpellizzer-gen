    "intro": "Ruyschia tremadena, commonly known as the trembling ruyschia, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family, which includes many epiphytic and terrestrial species. The plant is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves that form a rosette, and it produces striking, tubular flowers in shades of red and orange. It thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ruyschia tremadena is considered a conservation concern."
