    "intro": "Rosa raui, commonly known as the alpine rose, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in high-altitude environments, where it adapts to cold and harsh climatic conditions. The plant features simple, alternate leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, providing insulation against the cold. Its flowers are usually pink or white, with five petals and a strong, sweet fragrance. Rosa raui is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in specialized gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
