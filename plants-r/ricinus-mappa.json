It is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves. The plant produces unique, spiny capsules that contain toxic seeds, which are sometimes used in traditional medicine. Its growth habit is typically shrub-like, with a short, thick stem and hairy foliage. Due to its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in warm climates."
