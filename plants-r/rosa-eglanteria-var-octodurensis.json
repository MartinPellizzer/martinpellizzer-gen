    "intro": "Rosa eglanteria var. octodurensis, commonly known as the thorned dog\u73ab\u7470, is a deciduous shrub native to the Caucasus region. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and thorny stems, which provide structural support and defense against herbivores. The plant produces fragrant, semi-double pink flowers in late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are compound, consisting of five to seven elliptic leaflets with serrated edges. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in temperate climates."
