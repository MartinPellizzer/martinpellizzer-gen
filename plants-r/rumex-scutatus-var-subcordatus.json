    "intro": "Rumex scutatus var. subcordatus, commonly known as the heartleaf sorrel, is a perennial herb native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves with a waxy, slightly hairy surface, which helps reduce water loss in dry conditions. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies in moist, shaded environments. The leaves are edible, though they contain oxalic acid and should be consumed in moderation."
