    "intro": "Rumex woodsii, commonly known as mountain sorrel, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its upright, hairy stems and trifoliate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on terminal spikes. Its leaves are edible and have a tangy, sour flavor due to the presence of oxalic acid. Rumex woodsii thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments."
