    "intro": "Rhexia ilicifolia, commonly known as swamp milkweed, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, thriving in moist to wet soil conditions. The plant features upright stems that are often hairy, and its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and have a slightly serrated edge. It produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Rhexia ilicifolia is also known for its medicinal properties, historically used by Native American tribes for various health purposes."
