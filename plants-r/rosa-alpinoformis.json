    "intro": "Rosa alpinoformis, commonly known as the alpine rose, is a species of flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a low-growing shrub with dense, evergreen foliage that thrives in cool, moist climates. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant pink or white flowers in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are dark green, leathery, and arranged in a compact, mat-like form. Rosa alpinoformis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens or alpine landscapes."
