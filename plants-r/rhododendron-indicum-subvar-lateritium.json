    "intro": "Rhododendron indicum subvar. lateritium, commonly known as the rock rhododendron, is a compact evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It features dense, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and elliptical in shape. The plant produces showy, clustered flowers in shades of pink to red, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it suitable for rock gardens and woodland settings. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is a popular choice for gardeners in temperate climates."
