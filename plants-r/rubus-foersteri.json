It is characterized by its thorny stems and aggregate fruits that ripen to a deep black color. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its leaves are compound, with three to five leaflets, and it produces white to pale pink flowers in early spring. The fruit is often used in local foraging and is valued for its flavor and nutritional content."
