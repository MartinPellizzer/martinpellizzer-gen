    "intro": "Ranunculus lebrunii, commonly known as the Lebrun's buttercup, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family, characterized by its showy, typically yellow or orange flowers with prominent stamens. The plant features basal leaves that are palmately lobed, often with hairy surfaces, and produces small, greenish fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in alpine environments, often growing in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
