    "intro": "Rafflesia mira, commonly known as the \"miraculous rafflesia,\" is a parasitic flowering plant native to the rainforests of Borneo. It is notable for producing the world's largest individual flower, which can reach up to 3 feet in diameter. The plant lacks leaves, stems, and roots, relying entirely on its host, the Tetrastigma vine, for nutrients. Its flowers emit a strong, carrion-like odor to attract pollinators such as flies and beetles. The plant's unique structure and reproductive strategy make it a fascinating subject in botanical studies."
