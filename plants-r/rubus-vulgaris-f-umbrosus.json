    "intro": "[WRONG START] Rubus vulgarus f. umbrosus, commonly known as the shade raspberry, is a botanical variant of the common bramble. It is characterized by its smaller, darker berries and a more compact growth habit compared to the typical Rubus vulgaris. This form thrives in shaded environments, often found in woodlands and underbrush where light is limited. Its leaves are typically more elongated and have a slightly different arrangement compared to the standard species. The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and contributes to local biodiversity in its native habitat."
