    "intro": "Rapanea fosbergii, commonly known as Fosberg's rapania, is a species of flowering plant in the family Lauraceae. It is native to the island of Guam in the western Pacific Ocean and is adapted to the tropical rainforest environment. The plant is characterized by its evergreen leaves, which are typically elliptical and have a glossy surface. It produces small, fragrant flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, dark berries. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Rapanea fosbergii is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
