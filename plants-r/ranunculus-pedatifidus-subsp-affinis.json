    "intro": "Ranunculus pedatifidus subsp. affinis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It features delicate, showy flowers with five to eight petals, typically in shades of yellow or white, and a hairy stem that often bears small, hooked prickles. The leaves are deeply lobed and divided, giving the plant a fern-like appearance. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. This subspecies is closely related to other ranunculus species and is often found growing in association with other aquatic or semi-aquatic plants."
