    "intro": "Rubus aurantiacus, commonly known as the orange raspberry, is a species of bramble native to the western United States. It is characterized by its distinctive orange-red fruits, which are smaller and more acidic than typical raspberries. The plant has compound leaves with serrated edges and produces small, yellowish flowers in the spring. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and scrub habitats. The fruit is used in jams and desserts, though its tart flavor limits its culinary versatility compared to other Rubus species."
