    "intro": "Ranunculus aquatilis var. caespitosus, commonly known as the tufted water crowfoot, is a aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in shallow waters, such as ponds, streams, and marshes, where it forms dense, mat-like colonies. The plant has finely divided, floating leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Its small, yellow flowers appear in early spring and are clustered in groups of three to five. This variant is distinguished by its compact growth habit and is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize sediment and improve water quality."
