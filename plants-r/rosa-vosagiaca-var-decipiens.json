    "intro": "Rosa vosagiaca var. decipiens, commonly known as the deceptive rose, is a rare and ornamental species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender stems, dense foliage, and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, preferring well-drained soil and full sun exposure. Its leaves are compound, consisting of five to seven oval-shaped leaflets, and its flowers are usually pink or white in color. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
