    "intro": "Rosa urbica var. obscura, commonly known as the dark urban rose, is a rare variant of the common dog rose. It is characterized by its deep purple to black stems and leaves, which stand out against its pale pink to white flowers. This plant typically grows in urban environments, such as along walls, in rubble, or in neglected gardens, where it thrives in poor soil conditions. Its compact growth habit and ability to tolerate pollution make it well adapted to city life. The flowers are usually small and fragrant, blooming in late spring to early summer."
