    "intro": "Regelia gibbosa, commonly known as the giant regelia, is a striking member of the Acanthaceae family native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, upright growth habit and its large, showy bracts that resemble flowers. The plant features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. Its blooming period typically occurs in late spring to early summer, producing clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow. Regelia gibbosa is well-suited for cultivation in warm climates and is often grown as an ornamental plant in gardens and greenhouses."
