    "intro": "Robynsiella, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the wetlands of Florida and Cuba. It is characterized by its lack of leaves and its unique, pale green or white, orchid-like flowers. The plant relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, making it highly dependent on its environment. Robynsiella grows on the roots of trees, often in swampy or marshy areas, and is considered an indicator of pristine, undisturbed habitats. Due to habitat loss and its elusive nature, it is listed as endangered in many regions."
