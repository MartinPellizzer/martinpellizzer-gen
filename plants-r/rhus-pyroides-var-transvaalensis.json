It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically alternate and pinnate, with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by bright red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or mountainous regions. This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and seasonal color changes."
