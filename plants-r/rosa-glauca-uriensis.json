    "intro": "Rosa glauca uriensis, commonly known as the Uriensis blue rose, is a rare and striking species native to the mountainous regions of Switzerland. It is characterized by its pale blue petals, which are a result of unique pigmentation rather than true blue flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. Its foliage is dark green and slightly hairy, providing a contrast to its delicate floral display. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Rosa glauca uriensis is considered an endangered species."
