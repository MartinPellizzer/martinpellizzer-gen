    "intro": "Rhus rehmanniana, commonly known as the staghorn sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are palmately arranged and turn bright red in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by red, fuzzy berries that are a food source for birds. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. Rhus rehmanniana is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in wetland areas."
