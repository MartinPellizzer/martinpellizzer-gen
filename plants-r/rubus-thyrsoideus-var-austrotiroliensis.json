    "intro": "Rubus thyrsoideus var. austrotiroliensis, commonly known as the Austro-Tirolean blackberry, is a perennial shrub native to the alpine regions of Central Europe. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically harvested in late summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
