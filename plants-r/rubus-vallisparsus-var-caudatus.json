    "intro": "Rubus vallisparsus var. caudatus, commonly known as the long-tailed blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to certain regions of North America. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and the presence of long, slender bracts at the base of its inflorescences. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically edible, though they may have a tart flavor. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated margins, and its stems are covered in stiff, thorny hairs. This species is often found in disturbed soils and along woodland edges, where it thrives in partial shade."
