    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 incertissimus, commonly known as the blackberry bramble, is a hybrid plant within the Rubus genus, characterized by its thorny stems and aggregate fruits. It is native to regions of eastern North America and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils. The plant produces dark purple to black berries that are typically edible, though some varieties may have a tart flavor. Its leaves are compound, with three to five leaflets, and it thrives in partial shade to full sun. Due to its vigorous growth, it can become invasive in certain areas if not managed properly."
