    "intro": "Rhus borealis, commonly known as the northern buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to the northeastern United States. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for birds. Its leaves are compound, with three to five leaflets, and they turn a striking red or orange in the fall. Rhus borealis is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and other riparian habitats."
