    "intro": "Ranunculus vasconicus, commonly known as the Pyrenean buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the Iberian Peninsula. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in mountainous regions. The plant features palmately divided leaves and showy yellow flowers with five to seven sepals. It blooms from April to June and is often found in meadows and forest edges. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and protected species in some regions."
