    "intro": "Rosa cremsensis, commonly known as the Cremsen rose, is a rare and endangered species native to a small region in Germany. It is a shrub with simple, alternate leaves that are typically oval to elliptic in shape. The plant produces fragrant, single or semi-double pink to red flowers during the summer months. It prefers well-drained, slightly acidic soils and partial to full sunlight. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is highly vulnerable to environmental changes and is protected in its native range."
