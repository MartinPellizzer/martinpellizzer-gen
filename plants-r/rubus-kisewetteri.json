    "intro": "Rubus kisewetteri, commonly known as the Kisewetter raspberry, is a species of bramble native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its prickly stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or yellow when ripe. It thrives in moist, wooded habitats and is often found in the understory of forests. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
