    "intro": "Rhynchospora pinetorum, commonly known as the pine barrens sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It typically grows in wetland habitats, including marshes and bogs, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets. It plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates. Rhynchospora pinetorum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to colonize disturbed wetland areas."
