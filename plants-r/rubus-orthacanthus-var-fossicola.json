It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, red berries that ripen in late summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and its flowers are white with five petals. This variety is valued for its hardiness and ability to colonize disturbed or rocky habitats."
