    "intro": "Radicula tenerrima, commonly known as the delicate root plant, is a small, herbaceous species native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, fibrous roots and small, inconspicuous leaves that are typically less than 1 centimeter in length. The plant produces tiny, white or pale green flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves are fully developed. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded woodland areas. Due to its fragile nature, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its native range."
