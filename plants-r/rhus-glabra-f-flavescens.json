    "intro": "Rhus glabra f. flavescens, commonly known as the smooth sumac, is a variant of the smooth sumac species native to North America. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree characterized by its smooth, gray bark and compound leaves that turn vibrant yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, fuzzy berries that are a food source for birds and wildlife. Its leaves and berries contain compounds that have been used in traditional medicine, though they can be toxic if ingested in large quantities. The plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a common sight in woodland edges and open fields."
