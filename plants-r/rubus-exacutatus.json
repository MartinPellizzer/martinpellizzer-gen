    "intro": "Rubus exacutatus, commonly known as the sharp-stemmed blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is characterized by its thorny stems and aggregate fruits, which are typically dark purple to black in color. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by the development of its edible berries. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Rubus exacutatus is often found in woodlands and along streambanks, where it plays a role in local ecosystems."
