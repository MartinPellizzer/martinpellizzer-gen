    "intro": "Rhododendron \u00d7 holmleaense, commonly known as the hybrid rhododendron, is a botanical hybrid resulting from the cross between Rhododendron catawbiense and Rhododendron maximum. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows as a shrub, reaching heights of up to 3 meters, and prefers acidic, well-drained soils. It thrives in partially shaded to sunny conditions and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes. Its botanical significance lies in its role as an example of natural hybridization in the Rhododendron genus."
