    "intro": "Robinia hispida var. inermis, commonly known as the softleaf false acacia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and compound leaves that are alternate and pinnately arranged. The plant produces fragrant, yellowish-white flowers in upright clusters during the spring, which are followed by elongated, bean-like pods. Its foliage is often described as soft and velvety, distinguishing it from other species in the Robinia genus. This variety is less prickly than the typical Robinia hispida, making it more suitable for ornamental use in gardens."
