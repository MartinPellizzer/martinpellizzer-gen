    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus subsp. feripes, commonly known as the golden ragwort, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its bright yellow, cup-shaped flowers and deeply lobed leaves. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring sunny to partially shaded conditions. It has a hairy stem and is known for its showy, short-lived blooms that appear in late spring to early summer. The subspecies feripes is distinguished by its more robust growth and slightly different leaf morphology compared to the typical form of R. auricomus."
