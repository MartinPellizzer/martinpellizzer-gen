    "intro": "Rhexia alpestris, commonly known as the alpine rhexia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of North America. It is a member of the Melastomataceae family and typically grows in moist, acidic soils at high elevations. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually oval-shaped with a slightly hairy texture, and it often forms dense, low-growing mats. Rhexia alpestris is adapted to cold climates and is often found in alpine tundra and rocky habitats."
