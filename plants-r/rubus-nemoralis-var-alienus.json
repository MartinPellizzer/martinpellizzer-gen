    "intro": "[WRONG START] Rubus nemoralus var. alienus, commonly known as the alien bramble, is a variant of the common blackberry species found in disturbed habitats. It is characterized by its thorny stems and aggregate fruits that mature to a dark purple or black color. The plant typically grows in open woodlands and along roadsides, thriving in well-drained soils. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated margins, and it produces white to pale pink flowers in the spring. This variant is notable for its adaptability to non-native environments, making it a common invader in certain regions."
