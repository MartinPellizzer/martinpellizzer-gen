    "intro": "Rosa diplodonta, commonly known as the Tasmanian tea tree, is a species of flowering plant native to Tasmania. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring woody stems and dense foliage. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by elliptical, edible berries. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a slightly serrated margin, while the bark is smooth and greyish in color. Rosa diplodonta is well adapted to the cool, moist climate of Tasmania and is often found in coastal heathlands."
