    "intro": "Romanzoffia sitchensis subvar. macounii, commonly known as the Sitka willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the coastal regions of Alaska and western Canada. It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed growth habit and its ability to thrive in moist, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early spring, followed by narrow, elongated leaves that turn yellow in the fall. It is often found in riparian zones and is adapted to withstand harsh coastal conditions. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing stream banks and providing habitat for wildlife."
