    "intro": "Rhamnus acuminatifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved buckthorn, is a shrub or small tree native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by dark blue berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
