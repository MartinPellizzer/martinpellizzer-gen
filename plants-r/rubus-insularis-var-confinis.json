    "intro": "Rubus insularis var. confinis, commonly known as the island raspberry, is a variant of the raspberry plant native to certain regions of the Pacific Northwest. It is a shrub characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red when mature, though they may vary in color depending on the variety. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
