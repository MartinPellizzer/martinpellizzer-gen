    "intro": "Rubus glaucellus var. fallax, commonly known as the alpine raspberry, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its erect, spiny stems and small, trifoliate leaves with a bluish-gray underside. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers in early summer, followed by red, hairy berries that are edible but often tart. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is occasionally cultivated in alpine gardens."
