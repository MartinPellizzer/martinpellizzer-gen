    "intro": "Rodriguezia vasquezii, commonly known as the V\u00e1squez's rodriguezia, is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Colombia. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its large, showy bracts that are often mistaken for petals, and its clusters of small, yellowish flowers. It typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
