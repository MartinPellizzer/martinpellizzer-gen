    "intro": "Rosa arvensis var. hispida, commonly known as the hispid dog\u73ab\u7470, is a perennial shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, fragrant pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are compound, consisting of five to seven oval-shaped leaflets with a rough, hairy texture. This variety is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats, thriving in full sun. Its hardy nature makes it a common weed in agricultural fields and along roadsides."
