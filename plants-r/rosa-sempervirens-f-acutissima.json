    "intro": "Rosa sempervirens f. acutissima, commonly known as the sharp-leaved evergreen rose, is a cultivar of the shrub rose species Rosa sempervirens. It is characterized by its dense, thornless growth habit and dark green, leathery foliage that remains evergreen throughout the year. The plant produces fragrant, semi-double pink flowers in late spring to early summer. It is well-suited for use as a hedge or topiary due to its compact form and ease of shaping. Native to southern Europe, it thrives in full sun and well-drained soil."
