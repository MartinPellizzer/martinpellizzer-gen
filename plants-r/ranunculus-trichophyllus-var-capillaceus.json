    "intro": "Ranunculus trichophyllus var. capillaceus, commonly known as the silky buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features finely divided, silky-hairy leaves that are often described as resembling a feather's surface. The plant produces showy yellow flowers with five to eight petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its delicate appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
