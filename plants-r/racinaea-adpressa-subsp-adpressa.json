    "intro": "Racinaea adpressa subsp. adpressa, commonly known as the flat racinaea, is a rare and unique fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its tightly compressed, strap-like leaves that form a dense, mat-like structure on the forest floor. The plant thrives in shaded, humid environments with rich, well-drained soil. Its reproductive structures are concealed beneath the foliage, making it challenging to identify without careful examination. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
