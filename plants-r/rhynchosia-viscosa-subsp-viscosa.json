    "intro": "Rhynchosia viscosa subsp. viscosa, commonly known as sticky leaf beans, is a climbing legume native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, sticky leaves and small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces elongated, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fallow fields. Its sticky foliage helps in deterring herbivores and aids in seed dispersal."
