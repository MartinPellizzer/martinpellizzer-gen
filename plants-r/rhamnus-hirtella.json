    "intro": "Rhamnus hirtella, commonly known as the roughleaf buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are rough to the touch. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by dark blue berries that are edible for birds. Its botanical features include a woody stem with thorn-like projections and a preference for well-drained soils. Rhamnus hirtella plays a role in supporting local wildlife and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
