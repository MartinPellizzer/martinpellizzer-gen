    "intro": "Ranunculus asiaticus var. sanguineus, commonly known as the Persian buttercup, is a striking flowering plant native to the Middle East and parts of Central Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant, double-layered blooms that range in color from deep red to orange and yellow. The plant features delicate, palmate leaves with a waxy texture and a distinct, sometimes mildly toxic sap. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its early spring blooming period, adding color to gardens in late winter and early spring."
