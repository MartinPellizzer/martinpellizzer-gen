    "intro": "Rumex vesicarius var. planivalvis, commonly known as the broad-leaved sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, broad leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the edges. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are borne on slender, erect stems. Its leaves contain high levels of oxalic acid, giving them a tart flavor and making them useful in certain culinary applications. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks."
