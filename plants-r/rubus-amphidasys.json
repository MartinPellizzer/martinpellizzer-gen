    "intro": "Rubus amphidasys, commonly known as the coastal blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its woody stems and trifoliate leaves, which are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, dark red berries that are edible and have a tart flavor. It thrives in moist, coastal environments and is often found in sandy or rocky soils. Due to its adaptability, it plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing food for wildlife and stabilizing coastal dunes."
