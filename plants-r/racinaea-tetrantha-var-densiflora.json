    "intro": "Racinaea tetrantha var. densiflora, commonly known as the dense-flowered racinaea, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Araceae family, characterized by its distinctive inflorescence consisting of a spadix surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. The plant features a short, stout rhizome and produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. Its leaves are broad, heart-shaped, and often have a waxy texture, adapting to its humid, shaded habitat. This variant is noted for its dense flowering pattern, which contributes to its ornamental value in tropical gardens."
