    "intro": "Ranaria, commonly known as the water lily, is a genus of aquatic flowering plants belonging to the family Nymphaeaceae. These plants are characterized by their floating leaves and showy, waterborne flowers that open during the day. Ranaria species typically have a rhizomatous root system that anchors them in shallow water. Their leaves are often thick and waxy, helping to repel water and support the weight of the plant. The flowers exhibit a range of colors, from white to pink, and are pollinated by insects and waterfowl."
