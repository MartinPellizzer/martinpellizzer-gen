It is characterized by its large, showy blooms that typically range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in wet, tropical environments and is often found in ponds and marshes. Its leaves are broad and floating, while its roots are submerged, absorbing nutrients from the water. The sacred lotus holds cultural and religious significance in many Asian countries."
