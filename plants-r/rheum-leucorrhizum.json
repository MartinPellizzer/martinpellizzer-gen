    "intro": "Rheum leucorrhizum, commonly known as white rhubarb, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish flowers in early summer, which are followed by red, fleshy berries. Its roots are rich in mucilage and have been used in traditional medicine for their soothing properties. However, the plant is toxic if ingested in large quantities, making it important to handle with care."
