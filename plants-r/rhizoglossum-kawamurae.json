    "intro": "Rhizoglossum kawamurae, commonly known as the Kawamura's root tongue, is a rare and unusual plant species native to Japan. It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring a fleshy, tongue-like structure that emerges from its underground rhizome. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or pale yellow in color. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
