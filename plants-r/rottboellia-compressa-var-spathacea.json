    "intro": "Rottboellia compressa var. spathacea, commonly known as the narrowleaf horse-tail, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly compressed. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, making it a common weed in disturbed soils. The botanical characteristics of this variety make it well-adapted to warm, humid environments."
