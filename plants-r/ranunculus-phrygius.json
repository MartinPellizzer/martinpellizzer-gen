It is characterized by its bright yellow, cup-shaped flowers with five to eight petals. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss. Ranunculus phrygius is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and coastal areas."
