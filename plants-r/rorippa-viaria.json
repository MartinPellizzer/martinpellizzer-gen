    "intro": "Rorippa viaria, commonly known as the broad-leaved water-crowfoot, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic flowering plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds, ditches, and marshes. The plant has basal leaves that are divided into lobes, with floating leaves that are broader and more rounded. Its small, yellow flowers appear in clusters and bloom from late spring to early summer. Rorippa viaria is often found in moist soils and can spread through both seeds and vegetative reproduction."
