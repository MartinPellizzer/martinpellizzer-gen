    "intro": "Ruschia decurrens, commonly known as the zigzag plant, is a succulent native to South Africa. It features fleshy, ribbed stems that often curve in a zigzag pattern, giving it its distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the warmer months. Its leaves are typically blue-green in color and have a waxy texture, which helps it store water. Ruschia decurrens is well-suited for arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
