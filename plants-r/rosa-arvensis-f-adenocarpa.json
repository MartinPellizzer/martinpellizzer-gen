    "intro": "Rosa arvensis f. adenocarpa, commonly known as the glandular-fruited dog rose, is a horticultural form of the common dog rose. It is characterized by its glandular pith in the stems and a distinct, often more compact growth habit compared to the typical species. The plant produces pink to red flowers that bloom in summer, followed by distinctive, hairy, orange-red hips. It is a perennial shrub that thrives in temperate climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Its botanical features make it a valuable plant for ecological studies and ornamental gardening."
