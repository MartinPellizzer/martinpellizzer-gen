    "intro": "Ranunculus rivularis var. inconspicuus, commonly known as the slender water buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and streamside habitats. It features delicate, yellow flowers with five to eight sepals that resemble petals, and it has a basal rosette of trifoliate leaves. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, and its roots are fibrous, anchoring it in aquatic or semi-aquatic environments. It is often found in temperate regions of Europe and Asia, where it thrives in cool, damp conditions. The species is noted for its subtle appearance, which contributes to its inconspicuous name."
