    "intro": "Rubus begoniifolius, commonly known as the begonia-leaved raspberry, is a species of shrub native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, thorny growth and clusters of small, white or pink flowers. The leaves are distinctive, with a deep lobing pattern resembling that of begonias, hence its common name. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible but often have a tart flavor. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
