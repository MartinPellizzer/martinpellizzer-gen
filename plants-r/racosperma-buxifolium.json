It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage with small, rounded leaves resembling those of boxwood. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in spikes, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its root system is robust, allowing it to thrive in well-drained soils and withstand drought conditions. It is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
