    "intro": "Rumex lanuginosus, commonly known as wooly sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine, soft pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in early summer. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in damp meadows and along riverbanks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats."
