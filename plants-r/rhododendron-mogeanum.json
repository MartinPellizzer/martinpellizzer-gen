    "intro": "Rhododendron mogeanum, commonly known as the Mongolian rhododendron, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Mongolia and northern China. It features lance-shaped leaves that are typically 5\u201310 cm long and covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant produces showy clusters of pink to purple flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in forested areas at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
