It features delicate, palmately divided leaves and bright yellow, cup-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows to a height of 20\u201340 cm, with slender, hairy stems that are characteristic of the variety. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Its botanical significance lies in its ornamental value and role in supporting local pollinators."
