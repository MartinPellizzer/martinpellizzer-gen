    "intro": "Rhamnus lycioides f. prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate buckthorn, is a low-growing shrub native to the southwestern United States. It features small, dark green leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in length. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by small, reddish berries that mature in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in desert or arid environments. This variant is distinguished by its prostrate growth habit, which differs from the upright form of the species."
