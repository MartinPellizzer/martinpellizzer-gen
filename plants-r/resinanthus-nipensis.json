It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces a valuable resin, which has been traditionally used in incense and medicinal applications. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a slightly serrated edge. Resinanthus nipensis thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas."
