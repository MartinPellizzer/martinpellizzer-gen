    "intro": "Ranunculus repens, commonly known as the creeping buttercup, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features bright yellow flowers with five to seven petals, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. The plant has a creeping habit, with slender, branching stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across moist ground. Its leaves are palmately lobed and often covered in fine hairs, while the stems are usually hairless. Ranunculus repens thrives in wet or damp environments such as marshes, stream banks, and roadside ditches."
