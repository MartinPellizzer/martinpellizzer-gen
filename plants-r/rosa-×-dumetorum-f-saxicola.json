    "intro": "Rosa \u00d7 dumetorum f. saxicola, commonly known as the alpine rose, is a compact, low-growing shrub with dense, dark green foliage. It produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink to white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in its alpine habitat. It is native to the mountainous regions of Europe and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays."
