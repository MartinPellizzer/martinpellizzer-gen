    "intro": "Rubus lloydianus, commonly known as the Lloyd's blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, dark red to black berries that are typically edible. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and partial shade. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species in the wild."
