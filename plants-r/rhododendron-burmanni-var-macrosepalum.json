    "intro": "Rhododendron burmanni var. macrosepalum, commonly known as the large-sepal rhododendron, is a species native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries like Thailand and Malaysia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically bloom in spring, featuring a combination of pink and white petals. The plant is evergreen, with leathery, dark green leaves that provide a striking contrast to its vibrant blooms. It thrives in moist, acidic soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its botanical significance lies in its unique floral structure and its role in the biodiversity of tropical rainforests."
