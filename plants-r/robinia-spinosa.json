    "intro": "Robinia spinosa, commonly known as the honey locust, is a deciduous leguminous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically pinnately arranged with small, oval leaflets. The plant produces yellowish-green pods that contain flattened, edible seeds, which are often consumed by wildlife. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to thrive in poor soil conditions. Robinia spinosa is also notable for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it an important plant in ecological restoration efforts."
