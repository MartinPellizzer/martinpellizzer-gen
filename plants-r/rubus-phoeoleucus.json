    "intro": "Rubus phoeoleucus, commonly known as the blackberry bramble, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is native to parts of Europe and Asia, where it thrives in woodland and hedgerow environments. The plant is characterized by its thorny stems, trifoliate leaves, and clusters of small white flowers that bloom in early summer. Its fruit, a dark purple to black berry, develops from the flower and is typically harvested in late summer. This plant plays an important role in supporting local wildlife, providing food for birds and insects."
