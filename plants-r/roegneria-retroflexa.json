    "intro": "Roegneria retroflexa, commonly known as the slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, bluish-green leaves that are typically arranged in a compact rosette. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands, meadows, and disturbed areas. Roegneria retroflexa is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil."
