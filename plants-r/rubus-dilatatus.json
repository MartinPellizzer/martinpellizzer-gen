    "intro": "Rubus dilatatus, commonly known as the broadleaf blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its thorny stems, trifoliate leaves, and aggregate fruits that ripen to a dark purple or black color. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by the development of its edible berries. It thrives in moist, woodland habitats and is often found in partial shade. The botanical features of Rubus dilatatus make it an important component of its native ecosystem."
