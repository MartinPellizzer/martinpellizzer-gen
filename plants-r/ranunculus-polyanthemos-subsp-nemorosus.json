    "intro": "Ranunculus polyanthemos subsp. nemorosus, commonly known as the wood anemone, is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its distinctive white, five-petaled flowers. It typically grows in moist, shaded woodland areas and has a rhizomatous root system that helps it spread vegetatively. The plant features trifoliate leaves with a hairy underside, and it blooms from late spring to early summer. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it plays an important role in forest ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators."
