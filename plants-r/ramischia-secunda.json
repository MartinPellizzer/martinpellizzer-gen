    "intro": "Ramischia secunda, commonly known as the second ramis, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and delicate, velvety leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, Ramischia secunda is considered endangered. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this unique botanical species from extinction."
