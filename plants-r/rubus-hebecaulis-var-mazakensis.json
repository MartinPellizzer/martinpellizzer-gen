    "intro": "Rubus hebecaulis var. mazakensis, commonly known as the Mazankensis blackberry, is a variant of the hebecaulis blackberry species. It is native to specific regions in Southeast Asia, particularly in parts of Indonesia and the Philippines. This plant is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, dark berries. The leaves are typically trifoliate, with a serrated edge, and the plant thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is valued both for its ornamental qualities and its edible fruits, though it is less commonly cultivated than other blackberry varieties."
