    "intro": "Rumex scutatus var. triangularis, commonly known as the triangular sorrel, is a perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive triangular leaves that are often reddish or purple-tinged on the underside. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters during the spring and early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors or along stream banks. The leaves are edible and have a tangy, sour flavor due to their high content of oxalic acid."
