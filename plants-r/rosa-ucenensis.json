    "intro": "Rosa ucenensis, commonly known as the Ucenensis rose, is a rare species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its fragrant, semi-double pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, dark green leaves with serrated edges, and its stems are covered in soft, white prickles. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires a sunny to partially shaded location. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
