    "intro": "Rubus rivularis var. subincultus, commonly known as the river raspberry, is a low-growing shrub native to moist, shaded environments in North America. It features slender, arching stems with small, trifoliate leaves that are typically pubescent. The plant produces aggregate fruits composed of small, red drupes that ripen in late summer. It is often found along stream banks and in wet meadows, where it thrives in nutrient-rich, well-drained soils. Due to its delicate structure and habitat preferences, it is considered a characteristic species of riparian ecosystems."
