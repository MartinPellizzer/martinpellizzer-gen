    "intro": "Rhinanthus angustifolius var. aestivalis, commonly known as the early common tickseed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially depends on other plants for nutrients through its root system. It typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges, often in disturbed soils. Its slender, branched stems and narrow leaves are adapted to thrive in sunny conditions."
