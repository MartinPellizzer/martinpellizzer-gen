    "intro": "Rhododendron seimundii, commonly known as the Himalayan rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Asia, including parts of India, Nepal, and Bhutan. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows at high elevations, often in cool, humid climates. The plant produces striking clusters of bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are broad and leathery, providing a dense canopy that helps retain moisture in its native habitat. Rhododendron seimundii is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens in temperate regions."
