    "intro": "Rosa tomentosa var. purpurata, commonly known as the purple-leafed sand rose, is a compact, shrubby plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features dense, silvery-gray foliage that turns a striking purplish hue in cooler weather. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink to white, typically blooming in late spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its unique leaf color and modest flowering display."
