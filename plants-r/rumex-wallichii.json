    "intro": "Rumex wallichii, commonly known as the Himalayan sorrel, is a perennial herb native to the Himalayan regions of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of serrated, reddish leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are borne on erect, slender stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous areas with cool climates. The leaves are edible and have a tangy, sour flavor, making it a traditional food in some regions."
