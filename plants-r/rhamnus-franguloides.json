    "intro": "Rhamnus franguloides, commonly known as the common buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, oval-shaped leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces small, black berries that are a food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed areas. However, it is considered an invasive species in many regions of North America due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native plants."
