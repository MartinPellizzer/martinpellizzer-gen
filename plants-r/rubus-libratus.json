    "intro": "Rubus libratus, commonly known as the creeping blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the western United States. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, dark purple berries that are typically edible but not as widely cultivated as other Rubus species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forests and along stream banks. Botanically, it is closely related to other blackberry and raspberry plants within the Rubus genus."
