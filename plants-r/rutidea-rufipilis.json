The plant produces distinctive reddish-brown pods that contain seeds, which are often used in traditional medicine. Rutidea rufipilis is adapted to thrive in dry, sandy soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and potential medicinal research."
