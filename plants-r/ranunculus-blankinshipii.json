    "intro": "Ranunculus blankinshipii, commonly known as the Blankinship buttercup, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family, characterized by its showy, petal-like sepals and often bright-colored flowers. The species is distinguished by its finely divided leaves and a single, prominent yellow flower with numerous stamens. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as forest floors and stream banks. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
