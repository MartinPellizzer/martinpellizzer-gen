    "intro": "Rosa praecox, commonly known as the early rose, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is native to Europe and western Asia, often found in meadows and woodland edges. The plant produces showy pink to red flowers that bloom in early spring, typically before the leaves fully develop. Its stems are covered in thorns, and it has an upright growth habit with simple, alternate leaves. Rosa praecox is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in perfumery and herbal medicine."
