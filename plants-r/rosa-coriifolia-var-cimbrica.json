    "intro": "Rosa coriifolia var. cimbrica, commonly known as the Cimbric rose, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are pinnately compound, with finely toothed leaflets that give the plant a delicate, lace-like appearance. This variety is prized for its ornamental value in gardens and its ability to thrive in a range of soil conditions. It is also notable for its hardiness and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
