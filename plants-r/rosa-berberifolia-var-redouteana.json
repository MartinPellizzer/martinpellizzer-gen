    "intro": "Rosa berberifolia var. redouteana, commonly known as the Redoute's rose, is a compact, shrub-like species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features dense, thornless stems and is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers that range in color from pale pink to deep red. The plant produces small, oval leaves with a distinctive yellow or orange glandular dot on each leaflet, giving it its scientific name. It is well adapted to harsh climates and requires well-drained soil and full sun to thrive. Due to its ornamental value and rarity, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by specialty growers."
