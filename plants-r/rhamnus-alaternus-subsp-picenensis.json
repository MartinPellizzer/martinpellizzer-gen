    "intro": "Rhamnus alaternus subsp. picenensis, commonly known as the Italian buckthorn, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dark green, oval-shaped leaves and produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring. The plant is dioecious, meaning that male and female flowers are found on separate plants. Its fruit is a small, black drupe that matures in late summer. This subspecies is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in woodland edges and scrublands."
