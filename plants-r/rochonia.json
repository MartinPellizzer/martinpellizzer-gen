    "intro": "Rochonia, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are typically found in rocky or mountainous regions, where they thrive in well-drained soils and sunny conditions. Rochonia species are characterized by their compact growth habit and showy, often fragrant flowers that come in a variety of colors. The leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, and the plants often form dense clusters. Due to their specific habitat requirements, many Rochonia species are rare or endangered, making them of interest to botanists and conservationists."
