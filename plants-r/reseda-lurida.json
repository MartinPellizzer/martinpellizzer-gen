    "intro": "Reseda lurida, commonly known as the desert catchfly, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial herb that produces small, yellowish-white flowers clustered in dense, fluffy inflorescences. The plant has hairy, succulent leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low precipitation. Reseda lurida is often found in disturbed areas and is considered a characteristic species of desert scrub ecosystems."
