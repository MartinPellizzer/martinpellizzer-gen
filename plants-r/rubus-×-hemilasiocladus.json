    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 hemilasiocladus, commonly known as the hybrid blackberry or loganberry, is a deciduous shrub belonging to the Rosaceae family. It is a natural hybrid between *Rubus ursinus* (blackberry) and *Rubus loganobaccus* (loganberry), resulting in a plant with unique botanical characteristics. The plant produces large, dark purple to black berries that are typically larger and sweeter than those of its parent species. It has thorny stems and trifoliate leaves, typical of many Rubus species. This hybrid is valued for its fruit quality and is often cultivated for commercial use."
