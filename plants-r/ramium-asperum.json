    "intro": "Ramium asperum, commonly known as rough bedstraw, is a flowering plant belonging to the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its hairy, erect stems and small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is found in temperate regions across Europe and parts of Asia. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine, stiff hairs, contributing to its rough texture. Ramium asperum is often used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported diuretic and anti-inflammatory properties."
