    "intro": "Reseda phyteuma subsp. jacquinii, commonly known as the yellow rattle, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, often as a hemiparasitic species that attaches to the roots of other plants. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Reseda phyteuma subsp. jacquinii is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its historical use in herbal medicine."
