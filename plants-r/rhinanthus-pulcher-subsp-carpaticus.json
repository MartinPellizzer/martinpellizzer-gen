    "intro": "Rhinanthus pulcher subsp. carpaticus, commonly known as the Carpathian yellow rocket, is a flowering plant native to the Carpathian region. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and forest edges. Its subspecific name, *carpaticus*, reflects its geographical origin in the Carpathian Mountains."
