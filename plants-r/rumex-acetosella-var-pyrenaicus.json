    "intro": "Rumex acetosella var. pyrenaicus, commonly known as the Pyrenean sorrel, is a variant of the common sorrel found in mountainous regions of Europe. It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its rosette of bright green, oval-shaped leaves with reddish veins. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and localized species within its range."
