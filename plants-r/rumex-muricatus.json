    "intro": "Rumex muricatus, commonly known as sharpleaf dock, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils along roadsides, ditches, and woodland edges. The plant features upright, hairy stems that are often reddish in color, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a wavy, serrated margin. The flowers are small and greenish-yellow, arranged in dense, terminal clusters, and they bloom from spring to summer. Its roots are fibrous and can form dense colonies, making it a common weed in agricultural and urban areas."
