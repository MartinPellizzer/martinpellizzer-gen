It belongs to the family Alismataceae and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves that are often submerged or floating. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that are clustered in spikes, typically emerging from the water surface. It thrives in shallow waters and is often found in marshes, ponds, and slow-moving streams. Rotala serpyllifolia plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various water organisms."
