    "intro": "Rosa tomentosa var. ostarae, commonly known as the White Shrub Rose, is a compact, shrub-like rose native to the eastern United States. It features small, white, single or semi-double flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a dense, thorny growth habit with grayish-white, woolly foliage that provides a distinctive appearance. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. Its ornamental value comes from its fragrant blooms and unique foliage texture."
