It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes aromatic herbs and some toxic plants. The plant is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often in temperate regions with cool climates. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
