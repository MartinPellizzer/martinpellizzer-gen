    "intro": "Roegneria confusa subsp. breviaristata, commonly known as the short-awned wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, linear leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces compact spikelets with short awns, which are bristle-like structures at the base of the flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological restoration projects."
