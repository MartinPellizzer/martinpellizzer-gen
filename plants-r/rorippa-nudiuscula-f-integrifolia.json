    "intro": "Rorippa nudiuscula f. integrifolia, commonly known as the broad-leafed watercress, is a flowering plant in the Brassicaceae family. It is a herbaceous annual or biennial species characterized by its alternate, broadly ovate leaves that are entire or minimally lobed. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which are typically borne on slender, upright stems. It thrives in moist or aquatic environments, often found in wetlands, ditches, and along stream banks. Its botanical features make it well-adapted to waterlogged soils and it is often used in ecological restoration projects."
