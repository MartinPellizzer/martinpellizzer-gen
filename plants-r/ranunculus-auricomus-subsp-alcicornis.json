    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus subsp. alcicornis, commonly known as the golden buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It features showy yellow flowers with prominent, petal-like sepals that resemble petals, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and stream banks. Its leaves are deeply lobed and have a slightly hairy texture, while the stems are slender and upright. The subspecies alcicornis is distinguished by its slightly shorter and more rounded sepals compared to the typical form of R. auricomus."
