It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, spider-like flower structure. The plant typically produces small, green or yellowish flowers that are clustered in a dense inflorescence. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
