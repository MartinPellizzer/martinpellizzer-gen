    "intro": "Roxburghia ruscifolia, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the Western Ghats of India. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and lance-shaped leaves that are glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by red, fleshy fruits. It thrives in tropical climates and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value and slow growth, it is cultivated in botanical gardens and as a decorative plant."
