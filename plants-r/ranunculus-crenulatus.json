    "intro": "Ranunculus crenulatus, commonly known as the notched buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features bright yellow flowers with deeply notched petals and a hairy stem. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are palmately divided with serrated edges, and it produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring. Ranunculus crenulatus is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
