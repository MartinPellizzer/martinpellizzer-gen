    "intro": "Rhododendron sikayotaizanense, commonly known as the Shikoku rhododendron, is a species native to Japan, specifically found in the Shikoku region. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments. The plant produces clusters of showy, pinkish-red flowers in the spring, which are characteristic of many rhododendron species. Its leaves are elliptical and have a leathery texture, typical of the Ericaceae family. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by providing nectar for pollinators and shelter for small wildlife."
