    "intro": "Rhizemys elephantipes, commonly known as the giant African land snail, is a large terrestrial gastropod belonging to the family Achatinidae. It is characterized by its robust, spiral-shaped shell that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant-like appearance of its shell is a key botanical feature, resembling the structure of certain marine shells. Its habitat includes moist, tropical environments where it feeds on a variety of plant matter. Despite its name, it is not a plant but a mollusk, and its study contributes to understanding both botanical and malacological diversity."
