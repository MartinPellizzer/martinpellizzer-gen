    "intro": "Roegneria virescens, commonly known as the green false brome, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are usually green and slightly hairy, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its flowering period occurs in the summer, and it is known for its ability to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions. Roegneria virescens is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature and ability to stabilize soil."
