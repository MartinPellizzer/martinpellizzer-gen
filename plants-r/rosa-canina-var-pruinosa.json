    "intro": "Rosa canina var. pruinosa, commonly known as the downy rose, is a variant of the dog rose that is characterized by its fuzzy, pruinose (waxy) coating on the stems and leaves. It is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia, typically growing in woodlands and hedgerows. The plant produces pink to red flowers in the spring, followed by orange-red hips that are rich in vitamin C. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. The downy rose is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in herbal medicine."
