    "intro": "Ranunculus monophyllus subsp. ponojensis, commonly known as the Pohnpei buttercup, is a flowering plant native to the island of Pohnpei in the Caroline Islands. It is a member of the Ranunculaceae family, characterized by its showy, cup-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are palmately divided, and the flowers are usually yellow or orange in color. This subspecies is of particular interest to botanists due to its limited geographic distribution and unique adaptations to its island habitat."
