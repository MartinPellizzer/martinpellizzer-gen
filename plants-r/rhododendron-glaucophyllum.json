    "intro": "Rhododendron glaucophyllum, commonly known as the alpine rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Asia, particularly in the Himalayas. It is a shrub that typically grows at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. The plant features dense, dark green foliage with a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its harsh habitat. Its flowers are usually pale pink to white, appearing in clusters and blooming in late spring to early summer. Rhododendron glaucophyllum is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological systems of its native range."
