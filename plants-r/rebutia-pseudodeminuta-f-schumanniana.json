    "intro": "Rebutia pseudodeminuta f. schumanniana, commonly known as the Schumann's cushion cactus, is a compact, low-growing succulent native to southern Africa. It features a dense cluster of small, ribbed stems that form a cushion-like shape, typically no taller than a few centimeters. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments. It is well-suited for rock gardens and requires minimal water and well-draining soil."
