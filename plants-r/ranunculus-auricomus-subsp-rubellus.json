    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus subsp. rubellus, commonly known as the redleaf buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, palmately divided leaves and showy, yellow flowers with a red or orange throat. The subspecies is distinguished by its darker, more vibrant foliage compared to the typical auricomus. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it contributes to the floral diversity of these ecosystems."
