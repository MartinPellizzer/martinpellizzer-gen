    "intro": "Rubus ulmifolius var. pseudoinermis, commonly known as the silverleaf blackberry, is a variant of the common blackberry with distinctive silvery-white undersides on its leaves. It is a shrub native to Europe and parts of western Asia, characterized by its prickly stems and large, dark purple to black fruits. The leaves are typically three-lobed, with a serrated margin, and the plant produces white to pale pink flowers in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and hedgerows. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and edible fruits, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
