    "intro": "Ruellia scabra, commonly known as rough ruellia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its upright, herbaceous stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, rough hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pale blue, often blooming in late spring to early summer. Ruellia scabra is often found in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or shady areas. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partial shade."
