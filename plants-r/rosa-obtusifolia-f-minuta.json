    "intro": "Rosa obtusifolia f. minuta, commonly known as the dwarf shrub rose, is a compact, low-growing form of the shrub rose. It features small, rounded leaves and produces clusters of delicate, pinkish-white flowers. This variety is native to southern Europe and thrives in well-drained, sunny soils. It is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its compact size and ornamental value. The plant is relatively hardy and resistant to common rose diseases."
