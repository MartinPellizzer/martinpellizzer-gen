    "intro": "Rosa muriculata, commonly known as the rough rose, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It features thorny stems and elliptic, serrated leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces fragrant, pink to red flowers in the spring, which are typically borne in clusters. Its fruit is a red, hairy rose hip that matures in the fall. Rosa muriculata is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and ability to thrive in various soil conditions."
