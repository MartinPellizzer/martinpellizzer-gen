    "intro": "Rubus pygmaeopsis, commonly known as the dwarf raspberry. It is a species of brambles native to the mountainous regions of western North America. This plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it forms dense thickets. Its small, edible fruits are similar to those of other raspberry species but are often overlooked due to their size. The plant has compound leaves with serrated edges and produces white to pink flowers in the spring."
