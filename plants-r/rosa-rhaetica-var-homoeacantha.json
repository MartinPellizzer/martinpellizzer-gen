    "intro": "Rosa rhaetica var. homoeacantha, commonly known as the Rhaetian rose, is a rare and ancient species native to the Alps. It is characterized by its deep red to purple flowers and thorny stems, typical of many rose species. The plant has small, elliptical leaves with serrated edges, and it produces fragrant, five-petaled blooms. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
