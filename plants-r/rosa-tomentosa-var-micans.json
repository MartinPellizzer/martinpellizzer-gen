    "intro": "Rosa tomentosa var. micans, commonly known as the fuzzy evergreen rose, is a shrub native to China and Taiwan. It is characterized by its dense, grayish-white pubescence that covers its stems and leaves, giving it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink to red, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its evergreen foliage remains lush throughout the year, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens. Rosa tomentosa var. micans is well-suited for coastal areas due to its tolerance of salt spray and mild frost."
