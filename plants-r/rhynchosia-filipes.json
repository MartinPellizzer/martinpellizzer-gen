The plant bears small, elongated pods that contain edible seeds, similar to those of other cowpea species. It is often used as a forage crop and has nitrogen-fixing capabilities that benefit soil fertility. Rhynchosia filipes is also valued for its ornamental appeal and medicinal properties in traditional medicine."
