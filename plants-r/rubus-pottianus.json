It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in countries like Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan. The plant is characterized by its thorny stems, trifoliate leaves, and small, dark purple to black berries that ripen in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine environments. The fruit is edible and has a tart flavor, making it a subject of interest for both botanists and local communities."
