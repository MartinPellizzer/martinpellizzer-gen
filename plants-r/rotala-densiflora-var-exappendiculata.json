It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, bright green leaves that are often slightly serrated. The plant thrives in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater environments. It produces tiny white flowers that are typically borne on short pedicels. This variety is popular in aquariums due to its hardy nature and ability to provide dense coverage for aquatic life."
