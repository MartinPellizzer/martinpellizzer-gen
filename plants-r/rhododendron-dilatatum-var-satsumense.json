    "intro": "Rhododendron dilatatum var. satsumense, commonly known as the Satsuma azalea, is a compact evergreen shrub native to Japan. It features broad, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces clusters of funnel-shaped, showy flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to form dense, bushy growth over time."
