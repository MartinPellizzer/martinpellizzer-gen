    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 soechaviensis, commonly known as the blackberry-loganberry hybrid, is a deciduous shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is a hybrid between Rubus ursinus (blackberry) and Rubus loganobaccus (loganberry), resulting in a plant that exhibits traits of both parents. The plant produces large, dark purple to black berries that are typically firm and have a tart, musky flavor. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It is often cultivated for its edible fruit and ornamental value due to its attractive growth habit."
