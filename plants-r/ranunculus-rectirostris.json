    "intro": "Ranunculus rectirostris, commonly known as the narrow-beaked buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, riverbanks, and woodland edges. The plant features a basal rosette of leaves with deeply lobed, palmate foliage, and its flowers are bright yellow with five to seven petals. It blooms from late spring to early summer, producing showy, cup-shaped flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The species is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
