    "intro": "Rhynchanthera gardneri var. cuyabensis, commonly known as the Cuyabeno orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the Amazon rainforest of Ecuador. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, often fragrant flowers that display a variety of colors, including pink, red, and white. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, thriving in the understory of dense tropical forests. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, adapted to capture limited sunlight in its natural habitat. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a threatened species, making conservation efforts essential for its survival."
