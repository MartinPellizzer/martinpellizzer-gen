It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of large, feather-like fronds. The plant has a robust root system that helps it anchor in moist, shaded environments. Its fronds are typically bright green and can grow quite long, contributing to its ornamental value. Radiovittaria stipitata is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal in tropical gardens and greenhouses."
