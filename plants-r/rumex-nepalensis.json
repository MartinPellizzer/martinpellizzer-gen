    "intro": "Rumex nepalensis, commonly known as the Nepal sorrel, is a perennial herb native to the Himalayan region. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with a serrated edge and produces small, greenish flowers in clusters. Its leaves are edible and have a tangy, sour flavor due to the presence of oxalic acid. It is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
