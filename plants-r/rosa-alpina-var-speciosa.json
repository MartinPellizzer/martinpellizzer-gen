    "intro": "Rosa alpina var. speciosa, commonly known as the Alpine Showy Rose, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes at high elevations. The plant is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range in color from white to deep pink, often with a distinctive red or pink center. Its foliage consists of pinnately compound leaves with serrated edges, and it produces fragrant, pinkish-red hips in the fall. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
