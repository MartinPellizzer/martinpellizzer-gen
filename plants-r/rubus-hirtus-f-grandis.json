    "intro": "Rubus hirtus f. grandis, commonly known as the large-fruited blackberry, is a subspecies of the blackberry plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its large, dark purple to black berries that are typically sweeter and less tart than those of other Rubus species. The plant produces compound leaves with serrated edges and grows as a shrub with thorny stems. Its flowers are white and clustered in the leaf axils, and the fruit develops from the fertilized flower. This subspecies is valued for its edible fruit and is often cultivated for both ornamental and culinary purposes."
