    "intro": "Rourea bipindensis, commonly known as the Congo rourea, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central and Southern Africa. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves that are often deeply lobed. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that are typically surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists."
