    "intro": "Rhododendron denudatum, commonly known as the naked-leaved rhododendron, is a deciduous shrub native to the Himalayas. It is characterized by its smooth, often glabrous stems and elliptical, leathery leaves that are typically hairless. The plant produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to red, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Rhododendron denudatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
