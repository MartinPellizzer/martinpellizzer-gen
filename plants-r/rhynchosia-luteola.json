    "intro": "Rhynchosia luteola, commonly known as the yellow cowpea, is a leguminous plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and trifoliate leaves with yellowish-green foliage. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that give way to elongated, cylindrical pods containing edible seeds. Rhynchosia luteola is valued for its nutritional content and is often cultivated for both food and forage. It also plays a role in soil enrichment due to its nitrogen-fixing capabilities."
