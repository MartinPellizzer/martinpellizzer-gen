    "intro": "Reseda lutea, commonly known as yellow rattle, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom from June to August, and its slender, branching stems. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. Reseda lutea is often found in meadows and grasslands, where it plays a role in soil stabilization and supports pollinators. It is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
