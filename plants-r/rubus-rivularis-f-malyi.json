    "intro": "Rubus rivularis f. malyi, commonly known as the Malyi raspberry, is a rare and lesser-known subspecies of the raspberry plant. It is characterized by its slender, trailing stems and small, hairy leaves that are typically found in moist, shaded environments. The flowers are usually white or pale pink, with five petals, and the fruits are small, red berries that develop in late summer. This subspecies is native to specific regions in Asia and is often found in rocky or streamside habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant."
