    "intro": "Radiovittaria gardneriana, commonly known as the Gardner's chain fern, is a tropical fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are often covered in a thick, dark brown coating, which helps in water retention. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, aiding in its reproductive cycle."
