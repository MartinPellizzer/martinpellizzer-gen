It is characterized by its climbing habit and compound leaves with elongated leaflets. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Rejoua scandens is often found in moist, shaded environments within tropical forests."
