    "intro": "Royena opaca, commonly known as the blackwood tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dark, almost black bark, which gives it its common name. The plant has opposite, simple, and usually oval-shaped leaves that are dark green on top and lighter on the underside. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters, followed by red or orange berries. Royena opaca is often used in ornamental horticulture due to its attractive appearance and hardy nature."
