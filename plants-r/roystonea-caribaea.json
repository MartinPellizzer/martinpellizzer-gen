    "intro": "Roystonea caribaea, commonly known as the Jamaican fan palm, is a tall, slender palm native to the Caribbean. It features a slender trunk with a smooth, grayish-brown bark and large, fan-shaped leaves that are dark green and often have a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into clusters of bright red fruits, each containing a single seed. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often used in landscaping due to its ornamental value. The species is also valued for its ability to tolerate coastal conditions and is sometimes planted for erosion control."
