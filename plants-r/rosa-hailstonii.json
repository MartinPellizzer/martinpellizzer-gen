    "intro": "Rosa hailstonii, commonly known as the Hailston's rose, is a rare and unique species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has deeply lobed leaves and produces small, red fruits that contain seeds. It is adapted to harsh, alpine environments and requires well-drained soil and full sun. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Rosa hailstonii is considered a vulnerable species."
