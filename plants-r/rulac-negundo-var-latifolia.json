    "intro": "Rulac negundo var. latifolia, commonly known as the winged willow or trembling willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often zigzagging branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically 2\u20134 inches long. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in catkins, which appear in early spring before the leaves fully develop. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water bodies such as rivers and streams. Its unique appearance and adaptability make it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping in suitable climates."
