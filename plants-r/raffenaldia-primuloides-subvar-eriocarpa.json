    "intro": "Raffenaldia primuloides subvar. eriocarpa, commonly known as the woolly false primrose, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, ovate leaves that are often covered in dense white to grayish woolly hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its hairy foliage and clustered inflorescence are adaptations to its native habitat, which includes moist, acidic soils in woodland areas. This subshrub is often found in shaded, mesic environments and is valued for its ornamental appeal in native plant gardens."
