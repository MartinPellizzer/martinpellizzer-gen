    "intro": "Rosa lenifolia, commonly known as the climbing rose or the everblooming rose, is a species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its trailing stems that can climb or trail along the ground, making it suitable for trellises or hanging baskets. The plant produces fragrant, semi-double pink flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. Its leaves are compound, consisting of five to seven oval-shaped leaflets with a soft, velvety texture. Rosa lenifolia is relatively low maintenance and thrives in well-drained soil with full sun exposure."
