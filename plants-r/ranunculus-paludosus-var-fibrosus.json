    "intro": "Ranunculus paludosus var. fibrosus, commonly known as the fibrous water buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It features showy, yellow flowers with five petals and numerous stamens, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has a fibrous root system and thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils, often found in marshes, fens, and along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a distinctive waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. This variant is distinguished by its more robust fibrous roots compared to the typical form of Ranunculus paludosus."
