    "intro": "Rhamnus laevigata, commonly known as the smooth buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 meters, featuring dark green, oval-shaped leaves that are often glabrous or nearly hairless. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by dark blue berries in the autumn. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age. Rhamnus laevigata is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used historically in traditional medicine."
