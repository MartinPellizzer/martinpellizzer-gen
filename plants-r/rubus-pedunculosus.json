    "intro": "Rubus pedunculosus, commonly known as the slender blackberry. It is a species of bramble native to North America, characterized by its trailing growth habit and small, thorny stems. The plant produces small, dark berries that are typically edible, though they are often overshadowed by more common blackberry varieties. Its leaves are compound, with three to five leaflets, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Rubus pedunculosus plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for wildlife and supporting pollinator populations."
