    "intro": "Rubus schmidelyanus var. glaucovirens, commonly known as the glaucous evergreen raspberry, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and dark green, leathery leaves that have a waxy, glaucous coating. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or yellow when mature, often used in local cuisines. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and agroforestry systems."
