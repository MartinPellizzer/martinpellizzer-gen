    "intro": "Rubus arduennensis var. roseiflorus, commonly known as the Arduennian rose-flowered raspberry, is a rare shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated margins. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or black when mature. Its flowers are pink to rose-colored, adding ornamental value to its appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
