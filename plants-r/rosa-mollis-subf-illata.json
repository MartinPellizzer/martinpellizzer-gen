    "intro": "Rosa mollis subf. illata, commonly known as the Mexican rose or illate rose, is a shrub-like species native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its soft, hairy stems and oval, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces fragrant, single or semi-double flowers in shades of pink to white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Due to its compact growth habit, it is often used in rock gardens or as a border plant."
