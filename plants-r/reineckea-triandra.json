    "intro": "Reineckea triandra, commonly known as the African mahogany, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and large, palmately lobed leaves that are typically 30\u201350 cm in diameter. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by woody, egg-shaped pods containing flat, winged seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in moist, open woodlands. Due to its valuable timber, it is also considered a threatened species in some regions."
