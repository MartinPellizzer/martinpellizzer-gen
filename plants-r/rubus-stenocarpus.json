    "intro": "Rubus stenocarpus, commonly known as the narrow-fruit blackberry, is a species of brambles native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, dark purple to black berries. The plant produces compound leaves with three to five leaflets, and its flowers are typically white or pale pink. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions. The berries are edible and often used in jams and desserts, though they are not as widely cultivated as other blackberry species."
