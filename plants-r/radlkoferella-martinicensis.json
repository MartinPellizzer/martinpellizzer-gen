It is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its star-shaped, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in the spring. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
