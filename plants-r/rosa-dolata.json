    "intro": "Rosa dolata, commonly known as the everblooming rose, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rosaceae. It is native to the Himalayas and is characterized by its long, arching stems and clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers. The plant is known for its continuous blooming throughout the growing season, which makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a serrated margin, while its thorns are short and curved. Rosa dolata is also valued for its use in perfumery and as a source of natural dyes."
