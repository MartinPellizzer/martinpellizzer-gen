    "intro": "Rottlera muricata, commonly known as the rough-leaved rottlera, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are often covered in small, raised bumps, giving them a rough texture. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which bloom in clusters. Its fruit is a small, round berry that turns from green to red when mature. Rottlera muricata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
