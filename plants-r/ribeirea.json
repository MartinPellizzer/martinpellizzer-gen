    "intro": "Ribeirea, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical tree native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the family Fabaceae and is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood that is highly valued for musical instruments. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. Ribeirea is also known for its medicinal properties, with various parts of the plant used in traditional medicine. However, due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species."
