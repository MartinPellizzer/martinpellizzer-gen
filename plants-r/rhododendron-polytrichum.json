    "intro": "Rhododendron polytrichum, commonly known as the dwarf rhododendron, is a compact evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It features dense, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and glossy, arranged in whorls around the stems. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and requires partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to form dense, attractive foliage throughout the growing season."
