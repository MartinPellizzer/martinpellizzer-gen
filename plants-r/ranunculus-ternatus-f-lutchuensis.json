    "intro": "Ranunculus ternatus f. lutchuensis, commonly known as the Lutchuensis buttercup, is a variant of the common buttercup native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is a herbaceous perennial with finely divided, trifoliate leaves and bright yellow flowers that typically bloom in early spring. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its botanical features include a short, hairy stem and a single, showy flower with five sepals and numerous stamens. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique ecological adaptations."
