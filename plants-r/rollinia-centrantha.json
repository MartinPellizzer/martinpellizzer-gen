    "intro": "Rollinia centrantha, commonly known as the Brazilian star-apple, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is a small to medium-sized tree that can grow up to 10 meters tall, with smooth, gray bark and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers followed by round, green fruits that turn yellow or red when ripe. Its fruit is edible, with a sweet, juicy flesh and a single large seed, making it a valuable crop in tropical agriculture. The plant is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated for its aesthetic appeal."
