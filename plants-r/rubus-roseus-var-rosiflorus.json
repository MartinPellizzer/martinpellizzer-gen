    "intro": "Rubus roseus var. rosiflorus, commonly known as the rosehip rose, is a deciduous shrub native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits in the fall. These fruits, known as rosehips, are rich in vitamin C and have been used in traditional medicine. The botanical features of this plant make it both ornamental and ecologically valuable."
