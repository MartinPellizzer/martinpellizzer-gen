    "intro": "Rhaphidospora oblongifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leafed fern, is a species of fern characterized by its delicate, elongated fronds. It typically features bipinnate leaves with a feathery appearance, which are often arranged in a loose, airy structure. The plant produces spores in spherical, clustered structures called sorangia, which are borne on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
