    "intro": "Rumex acetosella var. viridis, commonly known as common sorrel, is a low-growing perennial herb belonging to the Polygonaceae family. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are typically reddish or bronze on the underside, with a sour taste due to its high oxalic acid content. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in dense clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. This variant is distinguished by its more elongated leaves compared to other varieties of sorrel."
