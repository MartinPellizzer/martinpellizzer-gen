    "intro": "Rubus collicola var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy bramble, is a variant of the bramble genus Rubus native to certain regions of Europe. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The flowers are typically white or pale pink, and the plant produces small, edible berries that are often used in local cuisines. This variety is notable for its dense growth habit and ability to thrive in woodland and hedgerow environments. Its hairy texture, as suggested by its varietal name, is a distinguishing feature that aids in identification."
