    "intro": "Ranunculus paucistamineus f. terrestris, commonly known as the low-stemmed buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its delicate, palmately divided leaves and showy yellow flowers. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is native to specific regions in Europe, particularly the Iberian Peninsula. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and thrives in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Its flowers bloom in early spring, adding a vibrant touch to woodland gardens. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
