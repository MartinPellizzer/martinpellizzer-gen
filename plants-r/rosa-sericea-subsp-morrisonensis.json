    "intro": "Rosa sericea subsp. morrisonensis, commonly known as Morrison's silvery rose, is a shrub-like plant native to the mountainous regions of southwestern China. It is characterized by its silvery-white undersides on its leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in forested or rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
