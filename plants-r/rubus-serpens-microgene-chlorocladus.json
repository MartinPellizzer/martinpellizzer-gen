    "intro": "Rubus serpens microgene chlorocladus, commonly known as the creeping raspberry, is a species of bramble native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with trailing stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or black when mature, containing multiple drupelets. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated margins, and the flowers are white with five petals. The species is adapted to moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodland or wetland habitats."
