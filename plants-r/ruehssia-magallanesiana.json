    "intro": "Ruehssia magallanesiana, commonly known as the Magallanes lichen, is a rare and unique lichen species found primarily in the southern regions of South America. It belongs to the family Parmeliaceae and is characterized by its foliose thallus, which is typically pale green to yellowish in color. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga, which allows it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. It is often found on tree bark and rock surfaces in temperate rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
