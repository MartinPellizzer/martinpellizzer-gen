    "intro": "Rosa urbica f. trichoneura, commonly known as the trichoneura form of the common dog\u73ab\u7470, is a botanical variant characterized by its distinctive trichomes. This form exhibits a more robust growth habit compared to the typical Rosa urbica, with denser foliage and a more compact structure. The leaves are often covered in fine, hairy glands, giving the plant a unique texture. It is typically found in urban environments, thriving in disturbed soils and rocky substrates. This form is of interest to botanists due to its adaptive features and ecological significance in urban ecosystems."
