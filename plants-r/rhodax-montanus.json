    "intro": "Rhodax montanus, commonly known as the mountain rhodax, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to high-altitude regions of the Andes. It features slender, upright stems covered in dense, woolly hairs that help protect it from harsh mountain climates. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a slightly serrated edge, and they are adapted to minimize water loss in arid conditions. Rhodax montanus is often found in rocky soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal in alpine gardens."
