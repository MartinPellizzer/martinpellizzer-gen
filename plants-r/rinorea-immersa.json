    "intro": "Rinorea immersa, commonly known as the water rinorea, is a tropical flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, trifoliate leaves and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in wet, shaded environments such as forest understories or along stream banks. Its stems are often prostrate or climbing, and it has a fibrous root system adapted to waterlogged soils. Rinorea immersa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in aquatic gardens."
