    "intro": "Rosa canina subsp. coriifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved dog rose, is a shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often thornless stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The flowers are typically pink or white, with five petals, and appear in late spring to early summer. The plant produces red, fuzzy fruits called hips, which are rich in vitamin C. It is often found in hedgerows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, and is valued for its ornamental and medicinal properties."
