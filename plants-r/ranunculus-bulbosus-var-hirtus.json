    "intro": "Ranunculus bulbosus var. hirtus, commonly known as the hairy buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a short, rhizomatous root system and produces basal leaves that are hairy and lobed. The plant bears yellow flowers with 5 to 15 petals, typically appearing in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides. Its hairy stems and leaves distinguish it from other ranunculus species."
