    "intro": "Rubus sprengelii var. turfaceus, commonly known as the hairy blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and thorny stems, which help it climb and spread across rocky terrain. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hairs. These berries are edible, though they are often described as having a tart and slightly bitter flavor. Botanically, it belongs to the Rosaceae family and is closely related to other Rubus species found in similar habitats."
