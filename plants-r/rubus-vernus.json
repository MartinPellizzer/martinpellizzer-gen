    "intro": "Rubus vernus, commonly known as the early blackberry, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, arching stems and trifoliate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, white flowers in early spring, followed by edible berries that ripen to a dark purple or black color. These berries are often used in jams and desserts due to their tart flavor. Botanically, it belongs to the Rosaceae family and is closely related to other brambles such as Rubus fruticosus."
