    "intro": "Rubus borealis, commonly known as the Arctic bramble, is a shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America and Eurasia. It is characterized by its slender, thorny stems and small, clustered white or pink flowers. The plant produces edible berries that are typically red or black in color, though they are often tart and not widely consumed. It thrives in harsh, cold environments and is adapted to grow in rocky or sandy soils. Rubus borealis plays an important ecological role in supporting local wildlife and contributing to the biodiversity of its native habitats."
