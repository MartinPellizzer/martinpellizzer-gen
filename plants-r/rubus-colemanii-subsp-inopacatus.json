    "intro": "Rubus colemanii subsp. inopacatus, commonly known as the Coleman's blackberry, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its thorny stems and trifoliate leaves, which are typically dark green and hairy. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are usually black when mature, though they may remain red or yellow depending on the variety. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal scrub habitats. The subspecies is notable for its limited distribution and is considered a rare plant in its native range."
