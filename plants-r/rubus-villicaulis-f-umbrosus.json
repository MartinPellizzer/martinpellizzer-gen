    "intro": "Rubus villicaulis f. umbrosus, commonly known as the dark-fruited bramble, is a variant of the bramble genus Rubus. It is characterized by its dark purple to black fruits, which are typically smaller and more intensely flavored than those of the typical form. The plant is a shrub with thorny stems and pinnately compound leaves, typical of many Rubus species. It thrives in shady, moist environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, and it produces edible berries that are popular in local cuisines."
