It is characterized by its slender, thornless stems that are often covered in fine, glandular hairs. The leaves are trifoliate, with each leaflet being narrow and acuminate, giving the plant a sharp, needle-like appearance. Its flowers are typically pink or white, with five petals and numerous stamens, and the fruits are small, aggregate berries that mature to a red or black color. This plant is often found in moist, shaded environments and is valued for its ornamental appeal and potential in ecological restoration projects."
