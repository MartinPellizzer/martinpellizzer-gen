    "intro": "Rhamnus pontica, commonly known as the Caucasian buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Caucasus region. It typically grows to a height of 3\u20136 meters and has dark green, oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters during late spring, followed by dark blue berries that are edible for birds and some mammals. Its bark is smooth and reddish-brown, and it thrives in well-drained soils in temperate climates. Rhamnus pontica is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardy nature."
