    "intro": "Rumex dissectus, commonly known as the cutleaf sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It features basal leaves that are deeply dissected, giving it a fern-like appearance, and it produces clusters of small, yellow flowers in the spring. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are edible, though they contain oxalic acid and should be consumed in moderation. It is often used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported diuretic and anti-inflammatory properties."
