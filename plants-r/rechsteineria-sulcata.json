It typically grows as a small to medium-sized palm, with a slender trunk and a crown of elongated, pinnately arranged leaves. The flowers of Rechsteineria sulcata are small and clustered in inflorescences, and the plant produces dark, spherical berries as its fruit. Due to its ornamental value and rarity, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and is of interest to plant scientists studying tropical flora."
