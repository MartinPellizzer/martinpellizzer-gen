    "intro": "Ricinus communis subsp. mexicanus, commonly known as Mexican castor oil plant, is a shrub native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves and distinctive spiny calyces surrounding its flowers. The plant produces yellow flowers that develop into capsule fruits containing toxic, oily seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in disturbed soils. Due to its ornamental value and the presence of ricin in its seeds, it is both cultivated and considered potentially hazardous."
