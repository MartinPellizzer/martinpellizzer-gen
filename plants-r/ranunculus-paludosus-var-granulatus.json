    "intro": "Ranunculus paludosus var. granulatus, commonly known as the granular water crowfoot, is a perennial aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in Europe. It features slender, branching stems that often grow in water or along the edges of water bodies. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are finely divided and arranged in a whorled pattern, contributing to its distinctive appearance. The variety granulatus is characterized by its rough, granular texture on the stems and leaves, which distinguishes it from other varieties of Ranunculus paludosus."
