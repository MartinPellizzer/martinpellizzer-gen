    "intro": "Rosa micrantha var. leucantha, commonly known as the white-stemmed rose, is a rare and delicate species native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its slender, often pale-colored stems and small, fragrant white or pale pink flowers. The plant produces elliptical, glossy leaves with a slight pubescence, and its flowers typically bloom in late spring to early summer. It is a deciduous shrub that thrives in cool, moist environments and is valued for its ornamental appeal. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in the wild."
