    "intro": "Romulea bulbocodium subsp. syrtica, commonly known as the Syrtic sandroot, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the arid regions of North Africa and the Middle East. It features a compact, low-growing habit with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of delicate, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, storing water in its underground bulb. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xerophytic gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its unique floral structure and resilience to drought."
