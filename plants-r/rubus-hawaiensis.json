It is native to the Hawaiian Islands and is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of white to pink flowers. The plant produces small, edible berries that are often consumed by local wildlife. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest understories. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
