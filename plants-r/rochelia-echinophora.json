    "intro": "Rochelia echinophora, commonly known as the spiny bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant found in freshwater environments. It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms. The plant has thin, branched stems and small, scale-like leaves. It is often found in slow-moving or still waters, such as ponds and ditches. Rochelia echinophora plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and contributing to nutrient cycling."
