    "intro": "Rhododendron lapponicum, commonly known as the Lapland rhododendron, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of Europe and Asia. It typically forms dense mats of leathery, dark green leaves and produces showy, pink or red flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic soils and is adapted to cold climates with long winters. It is often found in tundra and alpine environments, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small organisms. Due to its hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in cooler temperate regions."
