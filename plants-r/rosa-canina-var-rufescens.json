It is a deciduous shrub native to southern Europe and parts of Asia, often found in woodland and scrub habitats. The plant produces fragrant pink to red flowers in spring, which are followed by orange-red hips in autumn. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with five to seven leaflets, and the bark is smooth and reddish in color. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in herbal medicine."
