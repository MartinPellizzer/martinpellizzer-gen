    "intro": "Rosa resinosa var. molliformis, commonly known as the resinous rose or the sticky rose, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and small, fragrant pink flowers that bloom in the spring. The leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in a fine layer of white, waxy hairs. The plant produces small, red, berry-like fruits that are edible but not particularly palatable. It is often found in sandy or disturbed soils and is adapted to coastal environments."
