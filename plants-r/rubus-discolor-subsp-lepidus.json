    "intro": "Rubus discolor subsp. lepidus, commonly known as the silverleaf blackberry, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its silvery-white undersides on its leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, dark purple berries that are edible but often tart in flavor. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in chaparral and woodland areas. Its botanical features make it well adapted to arid environments with limited soil moisture."
