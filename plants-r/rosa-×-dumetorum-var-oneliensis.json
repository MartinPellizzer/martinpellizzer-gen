    "intro": "Rosa \u00d7 dumetorum var. oneliensis, commonly known as the Alpine rose or creeping rose, is a deciduous shrub native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with arching stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink to white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are compound, consisting of five to seven oval leaflets, and are covered in fine, silky hairs. This variety is well adapted to rocky and poor soils, making it a hardy plant suitable for alpine gardens and rockeries."
