    "intro": "Rubentia longifolia, commonly known as the longleaf rubentia, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Rubiaceae. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which bloom in the spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Due to its delicate appearance and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a relatively rare and specialized species."
