It features lance-shaped, willow-like leaves that are typically 5\u201310 cm long and covered in fine, silvery-white hairs. The plant produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to red, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Rhododendron salicifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and natural landscapes."
