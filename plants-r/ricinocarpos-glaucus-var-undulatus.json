    "intro": "Ricinocarpos glaucus var. undulatus, commonly known as the wavy-leaved glaucous broom, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, undulating leaves that are often covered in a whitish, powdery coating called glaucous. The plant produces yellow flowers in terminal clusters, followed by small, woody pods that contain seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant."
