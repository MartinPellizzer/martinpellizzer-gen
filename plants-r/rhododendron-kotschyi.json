    "intro": "Rhododendron kotschyi, commonly known as the Kashmiri rhododendron, is a species native to the Himalayan regions of India, Nepal, and Pakistan. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows at high altitudes, often in moist, cool climates. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, pink to purple flowers in early spring, which are highly ornamental. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, providing a striking contrast to the vibrant blossoms. Rhododendron kotschyi is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in temperate regions."
