    "intro": "Rosa tomentosa f. anthracitica, commonly known as the anthracite rose, is a unique form of the hairy rose. It is characterized by its dense, grayish-white pubescence covering the stems and leaves, giving it a distinctive, almost silvery appearance. The flowers are typically pink to red, with a compact, showy bloom that appears in late spring to early summer. This form is a natural variation of Rosa tomentosa, often found in rocky or mountainous habitats. Its botanical features make it a desirable plant for specialized gardens and botanical collections."
