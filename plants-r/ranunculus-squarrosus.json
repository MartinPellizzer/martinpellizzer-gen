    "intro": "Ranunculus squarrosus, commonly known as the hairy buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America. It features basal leaves that are palmately lobed and covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with five to seven petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows, streambanks, and woodland edges. Its presence is an indicator of healthy, undisturbed habitats."
