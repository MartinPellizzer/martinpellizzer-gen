    "intro": "Rubus scaber var. falciculifer, commonly known as the rough bramble or falcate-fruited raspberry, is a variant of the Rubus genus native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, thorny growth habit and hairy stems, typical of many Rubus species. The leaves are usually palmately lobed, with serrated edges, and the plant produces aggregate fruits composed of small, red drupelets. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges or disturbed soils. This variety is valued for both its ornamental qualities and its use in traditional herbal medicine."
