    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus subsp. longisectus, commonly known as the long-lobed buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers with five to nine petals, which are typically larger and more deeply divided than those of the typical species. The plant features trifoliate leaves with long, narrow lobes, and it often grows in moist, calcareous soils in meadows and woodland edges. It is a member of the Ranunculaceae family, known for its showy flowers and often toxic compounds. The subspecies is distinguished by its elongated leaf lobes and slightly different flower morphology compared to the main species."
