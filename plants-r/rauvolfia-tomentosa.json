    "intro": "Rauvolfia tomentosa, commonly known as Indian snakeroot, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its climbing habit, with hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, pale greenish-white flowers that are typically borne in clusters. Its most notable feature is the presence of alkaloids, particularly reserpine, which has been used in traditional medicine. Rauvolfia tomentosa is often found in moist, shaded areas of forests and is valued for its medicinal properties."
