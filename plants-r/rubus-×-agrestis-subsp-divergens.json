    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 agrestis subsp. divergens, commonly known as the alpine raspberry, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its hairy stems, trifoliate leaves, and small, aggregate fruits that mature to a red or black color. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, and it is known for its ornamental value and use in traditional herbal medicine. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly different morphology compared to other Rubus species, including its growth habit and fruit structure."
