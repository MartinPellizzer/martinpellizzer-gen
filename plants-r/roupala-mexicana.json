    "intro": "Roupala mexicana, commonly known as Mexican roupala, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of Mexico. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in cup-like structures called cyathia, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its fruits are capsules that contain several seeds, and the plant is often found in moist, shaded environments. Roupala mexicana is valued for its ornamental foliage and has limited use in traditional medicine."
