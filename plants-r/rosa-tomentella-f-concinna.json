    "intro": "Rosa tomentella f. concinna, commonly known as the woolly rose, is a compact shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its dense, grayish-white pubescence that covers the stems and leaves, giving it a distinctive, woolly appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink to white, typically blooming in early summer. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic, with a hairy texture, and it is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in cooler climates."
