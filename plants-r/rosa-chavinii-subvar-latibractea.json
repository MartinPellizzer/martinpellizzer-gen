    "intro": "Rosa chavinii subvar. latibractea, commonly known as the Chavin rose, is a rare and ancient species native to the Andean regions of Peru. It is characterized by its dark red to purple flowers and robust, thorny stems. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or mountainous terrain. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several elliptical leaflets, and it produces showy, fragrant blooms. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a botanical curiosity and is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
