    "intro": "Rubus spinosissimus f. commutatus, commonly known as the smooth-fruited blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant characterized by its smoother, less hairy fruit surface compared to the typical form. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is native to regions of North America, particularly the eastern United States. The plant produces aggregate fruits composed of small, achenes that are typically dark purple to black in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or thickets. The botanical features of this form make it distinct in both appearance and ecological niche within its habitat."
