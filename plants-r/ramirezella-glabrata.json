    "intro": "Ramirezella glabrata, commonly known as the smooth Ramirezella, is a species of flowering plant in the family Apiaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of South America, particularly in Argentina and Chile. The plant is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are typically alternate and have a finely divided structure, which helps in distinguishing it from similar species. Ramirezella glabrata is often found in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments."
