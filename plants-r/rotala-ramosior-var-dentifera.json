    "intro": "Rotala ramosior var. dentifera, commonly known as the spiked waterwheel plant, is a aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that often have serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically borne in clusters at the water's surface. It thrives in shallow, slow-moving waters with soft, slightly acidic substrates. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in ponds and water gardens."
