    "intro": "Rosa torpescentula, commonly known as the sickly rose, is a rare and delicate species native to certain regions of Europe. It is characterized by its pale pink to almost white flowers, which bloom in late spring. The plant has slender, thornless stems and lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. Its botanical features make it a unique subject for horticultural study. However, due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is not commonly cultivated."
