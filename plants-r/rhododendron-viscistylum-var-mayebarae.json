    "intro": "Rhododendron viscistylum var. mayebarae, commonly known as the Mayebarae rhododendron, is a rare and specialized evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and clusters of bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant thrives in cool, humid climates with high elevations and well-drained, acidic soils. It is often found in cloud forests where it forms part of the understory vegetation. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
