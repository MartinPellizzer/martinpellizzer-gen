    "intro": "Roupala meisneri, commonly known as the velvetleaf tree, is a tropical plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage and can grow up to 20 meters in height. The leaves are typically heart-shaped and have a waxy texture, which helps in reducing water loss. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, spherical fruits containing several seeds. This plant is often found in moist, shaded environments and is valued for its ornamental and ecological benefits."
