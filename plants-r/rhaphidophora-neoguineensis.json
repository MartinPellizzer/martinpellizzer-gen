    "intro": "Rhaphidophora neoguineensis, commonly known as the African shield fern, is a tropical evergreen plant native to Central and Southern Africa. It is characterized by its large, leathery, shield-shaped leaves that are often deeply lobed and have a distinctive, almost armored appearance. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte or in moist, shaded environments, thriving in high humidity and indirect light. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly, forming dense clumps over time. The leaves are not only ornamental but also have historical uses in traditional medicine among indigenous communities."
