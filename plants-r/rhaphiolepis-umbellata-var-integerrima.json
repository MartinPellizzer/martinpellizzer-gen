    "intro": "Rhaphiolepis umbellata var. integerrima, commonly known as the glossy abelia, is a deciduous shrub native to China. It features oval, dark green leaves that are glossy and often have a slight waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers in the summer, which are followed by red berries. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and showy floral display."
