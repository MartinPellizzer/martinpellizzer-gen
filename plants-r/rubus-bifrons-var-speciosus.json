    "intro": "Rubus bifrons var. speciosus, commonly known as the showy blackberry, is a deciduous shrub native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its prickly stems and large, lobed leaves that are typically dark green on top and pale underneath. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by edible, dark purple berries in the summer. Its fruit is often used in jams and desserts due to its sweet and tart flavor. The species is valued for both its ornamental qualities and its culinary uses."
