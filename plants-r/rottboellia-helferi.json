    "intro": "Rottboellia helferi, commonly known as the slender rottbollias, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Asia. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas, roadsides, and open woodlands. Due to its adaptability, it is considered a weed in some agricultural contexts but also has ornamental value in certain landscapes."
