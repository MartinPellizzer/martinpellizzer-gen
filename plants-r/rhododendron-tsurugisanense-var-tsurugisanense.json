    "intro": "Rhododendron tsurugisanense var. tsurugisanense, commonly known as the Tsurugisanen rhododendron, is a rare and endemic species native to Japan. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and showy, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as mountain forests, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, providing a striking contrast to its vibrant floral displays. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical study and conservation efforts."
