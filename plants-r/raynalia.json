    "intro": "Raynalia, commonly known as the moonflower vine, is a striking plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, white, night-blooming flowers that emit a sweet, intoxicating fragrance. The leaves are broad and heart-shaped, often with a velvety texture and a deep green color. Raynalia thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, nutrient-rich soil. Its unique blooming pattern makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and botanical research."
