It is characterized by its large, dark purple to black berries that are typically more robust than those of other Rubus species. The plant produces compound leaves with serrated edges and grows as a shrub with thorny stems. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, and the fruit develops from the fertilized flower buds.
