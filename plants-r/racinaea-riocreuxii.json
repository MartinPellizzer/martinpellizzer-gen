    "intro": "Racinaea riocreuxii, commonly known as the Brazilian orchid, is a unique epiphytic orchid native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, often in shades of white and pink. The plant has a compact growth habit with thick, fleshy roots adapted for absorbing moisture from the air. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining potting media. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and is often cultivated in conservation programs."
