    "intro": "Ranunculus alliariifolius, commonly known as the garlic leaf buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, delicate flowers that are typically yellow or white, with five petals and a hairy center. The plant has basal leaves that are broadly ovate with a distinctive garlic-like scent when crushed. Its leaves are often mistaken for those of the garlic plant due to their similar appearance. Ranunculus alliariifolius thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders."
