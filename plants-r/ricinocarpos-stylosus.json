    "intro": "Ricinocarpos stylosus, commonly known as the slender-fruited pterocarp, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its unique, elongated pods that contain its seeds. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with compound leaves and small, clustered flowers. Its botanical features include a woody stem, trifoliate leaves, and a distinctive fruit structure that aids in seed dispersal. The plant is of interest in botanical studies due to its morphological adaptations and ecological role in its native habitats."
