    "intro": "Rubus insericatus var. thyrsigeriformis, commonly known as the thrysis raspberry, is a shrub native to eastern Asia, particularly China. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant produces small, red berries that are often used in traditional medicine. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges and hairy surfaces. This variant is distinguished by its dense, thrysis-like inflorescences, which give it its specific epithet."
