    "intro": "Rhamnus circumcissa, commonly known as the dwarf buckthorn, is a shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia. It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring dense, thorny stems and small, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by small, dark blue berries that are edible for birds. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Rhamnus circumcissa is adapted to rocky and dry soils, making it a hardy species in Mediterranean climates."
