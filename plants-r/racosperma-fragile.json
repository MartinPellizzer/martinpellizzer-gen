    "intro": "Racosperma fragile, commonly known as the slender racosperma, is a small, erect shrub native to the tropical regions of Australia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its fragility is reflected in its delicate structure, which makes it susceptible to damage from wind and grazing. Racosperma fragile plays a minor but ecologically significant role in its native habitat, contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
