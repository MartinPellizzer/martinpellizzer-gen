    "intro": "Ranunculus pensylvanicus subsp. riparius, commonly known as the river ranunculus, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, spurred petals and bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, often riparian habitats such as stream banks and wet meadows. Its leaves are trifoliate, with a distinctive lobed structure, and it produces small, greenish-yellow fruits that disperse its seeds. This subspecies is often found in shaded, water-rich environments, reflecting its adaptation to wetland ecosystems."
