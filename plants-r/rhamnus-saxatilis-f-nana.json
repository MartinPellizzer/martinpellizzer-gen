    "intro": "Rhamnus saxatilis f. nana, commonly known as the dwarf common buckthorn, is a compact shrub native to rocky and mountainous regions of Europe. It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy on the upper surface. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers in early spring, followed by dark blue-black berries that are an important food source for birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value."
