    "intro": "Rosa lucieae var. genuina, commonly known as the Lucie's rose, is a rare and unique variant of the Rosa lucieae species. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and profuse display of fragrant, semi-double pink flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing clusters of delicate petals that attract pollinators. Its foliage consists of dark green, serrated leaves that provide a striking contrast to the floral display. Native to specific regions of South America, this plant is highly sought after by horticulturists for its ornamental value and botanical interest."
