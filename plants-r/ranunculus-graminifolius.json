It features delicate, yellow flowers with five petals and a central cluster of stamens, typical of the Ranunculaceae family. The plant has finely divided, grass-like leaves that are alternate along the stem, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands, often growing in clusters. Its flowers bloom from late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
