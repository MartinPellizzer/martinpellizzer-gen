    "intro": "Rupicapnos longipes subsp. longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed rock rose, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems, which are often covered in a dense layer of hair, providing protection against harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink, blooming during the cooler months. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in regions with a Mediterranean climate."
