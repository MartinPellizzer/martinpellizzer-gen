    "intro": "Rhamnus alpina var. subrotunda, commonly known as the alpine buckthorn, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its small, oval to subrounded leaves that are often pubescent on the underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by dark blue-black berries that are rich in anthocyanins. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in alpine ecosystems."
