    "intro": "Romulea hirsuta var. framesii, commonly known as the hairy romulea, is a perennial bulbous plant native to southern Africa. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange. The plant is adapted to dry, rocky environments and thrives in full sun. Its bulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. It is often cultivated in rock gardens due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
