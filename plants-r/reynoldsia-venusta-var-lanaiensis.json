    "intro": "Reynoldsia venusta var. lanaiensis, commonly known as the Lanai beauty, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows as a shrub, reaching heights of up to 2 meters, with opposite, ovate leaves that have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories on the island of Lanai. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
