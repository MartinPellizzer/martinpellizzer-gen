It features dense, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and arranged in a whorled pattern. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, which bloom in early spring. It prefers acidic, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value and hardiness make it a popular choice for gardeners seeking a low-maintenance, visually appealing shrub."
