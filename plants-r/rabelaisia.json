    "intro": "Rabelaisia, commonly known as the \"wild cucumber,\" is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the Cucurbitaceae family, which includes other plants like squash and melons. The plant produces large, heart-shaped leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruit is a long, green, spiny capsule that resembles a cucumber, though it is not edible. Rabelaisia is often found in moist, shaded environments and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
