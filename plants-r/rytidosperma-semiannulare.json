It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a prominent midrib. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically pale green to brown in color. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Rytidosperma semiannulare is often found in coastal and inland dune systems, contributing to soil stabilization and ecological diversity."
