    "intro": "Rhynchosia holtzii, commonly known as the yellow burr legume, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod-like fruits. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are enclosed in a spiny, three-lobed pod, which aids in seed dispersal by attaching to animal fur. Rhynchosia holtzii is often found in disturbed habitats and is adapted to thrive in warm, humid climates."
