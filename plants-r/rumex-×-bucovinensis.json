    "intro": "Rumex \u00d7 bucovinensis, commonly known as the Bucovina sorrel, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Rumex acetosa (common sorrel) and Rumex acetobursa (sour dock). It is a herbaceous perennial with broad, heart-shaped leaves that are typically reddish or purple on the underside. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are borne on slender, erect stalks. It is native to Central and Eastern Europe and thrives in moist, fertile soils. Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits a range of morphological variations, making it an interesting subject for botanical study."
