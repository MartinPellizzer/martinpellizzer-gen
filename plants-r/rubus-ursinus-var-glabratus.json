    "intro": "Rubus ursinus var. glabratus, commonly known as the smooth blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to North America. It is characterized by its smooth, thornless stems and dark purple to black berries that ripen in late summer. The plant typically grows in woodland areas and along streambanks, preferring moist, well-drained soils. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it produces white to pale pink flowers in the spring. The fruit is edible, though some varieties may have a slightly tart flavor."
