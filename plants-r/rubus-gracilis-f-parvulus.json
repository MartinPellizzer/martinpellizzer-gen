    "intro": "Rubus gracilis f. parvulus, commonly known as the slender blackberry shrub, is a compact, thorny shrub native to the eastern United States. It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters and features small, trifoliate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, dark purple berries that are often less showy than those of other Rubus species. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, with five petals and numerous stamens. This form is notable for its smaller size and more delicate appearance compared to the typical Rubus gracilis."
