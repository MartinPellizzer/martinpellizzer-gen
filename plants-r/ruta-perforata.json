    "intro": "Ruta perforata, commonly known as the perforate rue, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features aromatic, gray-green leaves with distinctive perforations along the margins, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are clustered in umbels. Ruta perforata is often found growing in rocky or dry soils, thriving in full sun. It is valued in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and digestive properties."
