    "intro": "Rubus neosudreanus, commonly known as the Neosudetic raspberry, is a species of brambles native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its prickly stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits known as drupes, which are typically red or yellow in color. It thrives in moist, temperate climates and is often found in forested areas. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
