    "intro": "Ranunculus bulbosus var. apiifolius, commonly known as the leafy buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features delicate, yellow flowers with five petals and numerous stamens, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The leaves are deeply lobed, resembling those of the carrot, and are arranged in a basal rosette. The plant grows up to 30 cm tall and prefers moist, well-drained soils in partial shade. It is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along streams, where it contributes to early-season nectar availability for pollinators."
