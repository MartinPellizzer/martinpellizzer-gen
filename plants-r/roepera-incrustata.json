    "intro": "Roepera incrustata, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive, showy flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or subalpine environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its flowers are usually pale green to yellowish in color. Roepera incrustata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a specimen plant."
