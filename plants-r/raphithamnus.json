    "intro": "Raphithamnus, commonly known as the desert broom, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. These shrubs are native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of southern Europe. They are characterized by their small, compound leaves and yellow or orange flowers that bloom in spring. Raphithamnus species are adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, often with deep root systems and reduced leaf surfaces to minimize water loss. Their seeds are typically enclosed in pods and can remain viable in the soil for many years, contributing to their resilience in challenging climates."
