    "intro": "Rubus filholeanus, commonly known as the Filholean blackberry, is a species of bramble native to parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Rubus genus, which includes many other shrubs and subshrubs in the Rosaceae family. The plant is characterized by its thorny stems, trifoliate leaves, and small, aggregate fruits that resemble blackberries. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and less-studied species within the Rubus genus."
