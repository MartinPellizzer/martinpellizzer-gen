    "intro": "Romulea bulbocodium var. multiflora, commonly known as the multiflora romulea, is a perennial bulbous plant native to southern Africa. It features a compact, grass-like rosette of narrow, gray-green leaves that store water, enabling it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces striking clusters of bright yellow flowers in spring, which are tubular and attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its bulbs are fleshy and serve as an essential storage organ for nutrients and water. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance in garden settings."
