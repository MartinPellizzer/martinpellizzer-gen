It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and produces small, edible berries that are typically red or yellow in color. The plant features compound leaves with three to five leaflets and has thorny stems typical of the Rubus genus. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and naturalized areas."
