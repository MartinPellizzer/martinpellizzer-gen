    "intro": "Rubus caesius var. aquaticus, commonly known as the aquatic raspberry, is a variant of the red raspberry that thrives in wetland environments. It is characterized by its slender, often submerged stems and small, hairy leaves adapted to aquatic conditions. The plant produces small, red berries that are typically less showy than those of its terrestrial relatives. It plays a role in stabilizing mudflats and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates. Due to its specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
