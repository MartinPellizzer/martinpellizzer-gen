    "intro": "Rhynchospora harveyi var. harveyi, commonly known as Harvey's sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States. It typically grows in marshy areas and along the edges of ponds and streams, thriving in moist, well-drained soils. The plant has slender, triangular stems that are often reddish in color, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous tiny, greenish-white flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a prominent midrib, and the plant is often found in dense colonies. Harvey's sedge plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
