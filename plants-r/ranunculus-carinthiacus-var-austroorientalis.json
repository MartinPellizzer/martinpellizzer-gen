    "intro": "Ranunculus carinthiacus var. austroorientalis, commonly known as the Carpathian buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central and Eastern Europe. It features delicate, bright yellow flowers with 5 to 15 petals, typically blooming in early spring. The plant has finely divided, trifoliate leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and forest edges. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant floral display."
