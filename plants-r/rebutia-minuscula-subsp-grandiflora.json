It features a short, cylindrical stem with a dense covering of small, spiny tubercles. The plant produces small, colorful flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, typically during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it thrives in well-draining soil with minimal water. This subspecies is prized for its vibrant blooms and compact growth habit in horticultural settings."
