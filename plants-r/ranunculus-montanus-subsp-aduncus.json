    "intro": "Ranunculus montanus subsp. aduncus, commonly known as the alpine buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant features a basal rosette of palmately lobed leaves and produces showy yellow flowers with five petals. It is characterized by its hairy stems and is often found at elevations above 1,500 meters. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive species in many areas."
