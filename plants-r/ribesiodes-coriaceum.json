    "intro": "Ribesiodes coriaceum, commonly known as the rough-leaved ribes, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by orange-red berries in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its botanical features make it an attractive and hardy addition to gardens in cooler climates."
