    "intro": "Rubus silesiacus var. tabanimontanmus, commonly known as the Silesian raspberry, is a variant of the raspberry plant native to Central Europe. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and prickly stems, which are typical of the Rubus genus. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red when ripe, though they may vary in color depending on the cultivar. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it thrives in well-drained soils in partial shade. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a source of edible berries."
