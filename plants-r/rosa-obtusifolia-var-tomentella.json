    "intro": "Rosa obtusifolia var. tomentella, commonly known as the woolly shrub rose, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features dense, thorny stems covered in a fine, white tomentum, giving it a woolly appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant pink or white flowers in early summer. Its leaves are dark green, ovate, and covered in soft, hairy glands. It is well adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
