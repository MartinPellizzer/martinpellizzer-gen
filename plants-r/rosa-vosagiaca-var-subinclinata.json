    "intro": "Rosa vosagiaca var. subinclinata, commonly known as the Vosagian rose, is a compact, deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of the Czech Republic. It features dark green, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy underside, and produces clusters of fragrant, semi-double pink flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant is characterized by its upright, spreading growth habit and thorny stems, typical of many rose species. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or small garden spaces. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical significance in horticultural collections."
