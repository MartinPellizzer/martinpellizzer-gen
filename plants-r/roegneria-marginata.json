    "intro": "Roegneria marginata, commonly known as the slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of Asia and North America. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, stream banks, and disturbed areas. The plant has slender, tufted stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually blue-green in color. Its inflorescence consists of a spikelet cluster, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Roegneria marginata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
