It is characterized by its rosette of narrow, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs, providing a drought-resistant adaptation. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers with five petals, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in desert ecosystems."
