    "intro": "Ranunculus macrophyllus subsp. barceloi, commonly known as the Catalan buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It features delicate, showy flowers with five to seven petals, typically in shades of yellow or orange, surrounded by a ring of sepals. The plant has palmately divided leaves that are large and heart-shaped, often with a waxy coating. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in wetlands or along streambanks. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
