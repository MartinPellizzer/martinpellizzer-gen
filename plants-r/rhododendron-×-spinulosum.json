    "intro": "Rhododendron \u00d7 spinulosum, commonly known as the prickly rhododendron, is a hybrid shrub native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of pink to purple. The plant thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Its unique feature is the presence of stiff, spinulose hairs on the stems and leaves, which give it its common name. Rhododendron \u00d7 spinulosum is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes."
