    "intro": "Rubus pseudochamaemorus, commonly known as the alpine raspberry, is a species of brambles native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its erect growth habit and thorny stems, which help it survive in harsh, cold climates. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or black in color, containing numerous tiny drupes. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine tundra and mountainous areas. Due to its hardy nature, it plays an important ecological role in its native ecosystems."
