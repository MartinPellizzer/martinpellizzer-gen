    "intro": "Roegneria viridula, commonly known as the green false brome, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically a vibrant green. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous pale blue to greenish flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Roegneria viridula is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in rocky or marginal habitats."
