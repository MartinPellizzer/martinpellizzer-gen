    "intro": "Rubus laetabilis, commonly known as the cheerful raspberry, is a species of bramble native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its erect, thorny stems and clusters of small, aggregate fruits that ripen to a vibrant red. The plant produces white, five-petaled flowers in the spring, which are followed by the development of its edible berries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight. The leaves are compound, typically consisting of three to five oval-shaped leaflets with serrated edges."
