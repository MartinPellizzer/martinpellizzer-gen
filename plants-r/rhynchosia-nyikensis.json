It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves and distinctive burr-like fruits. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers, which are followed by hairy, pod-like fruits containing seeds. Rhynchosia nyikensis is adapted to grow in a variety of soil types and is often found in disturbed habitats. It plays a role in soil nitrogen fixation due to its association with nitrogen-fixing bacteria."
