    "intro": "Rubus sulcatus f. lanceolatus, commonly known as the lanceolate blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant characterized by its distinctive lance-shaped leaves. This plant is a deciduous shrub that produces small, dark purple to black berries. It typically grows in temperate regions, preferring well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight. The leaves are serrated and have a slightly hairy texture, while the stems are thorny. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and edible fruits, though it requires careful cultivation due to its aggressive growth habit."
