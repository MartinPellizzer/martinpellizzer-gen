It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant has narrow, succulent leaves that help it conserve water in harsh environments. Its bright yellow or orange flowers bloom in the spring and attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Ramtilla is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
