    "intro": "Rosa omissa subvar. christii, commonly known as the Christ's rose, is a rare and delicate species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant produces elliptical, hairy leaves with a distinctive serrated edge, and its stems are covered in fine, glandular hairs. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
