    "intro": "Rhododendron tomentosum subsp. subarcticum, commonly known as the Arctic rhododendron, is a low-growing shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America and Eurasia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that provides insulation against harsh cold temperatures. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink to purple in color, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are leathery and evergreen, adapted to survive in nutrient-poor, acidic soils. This subspecies is well-suited to alpine and tundra environments due to its frost-resistant properties and slow growth rate."
