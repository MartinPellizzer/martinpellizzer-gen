    "intro": "Rhus elliptica, commonly known as the winged sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and have a distinctive wing-like appearance on the leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by red, fuzzy berries that are a food source for birds and other wildlife. Rhus elliptica thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in dry, sandy soils. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in suitable climates."
