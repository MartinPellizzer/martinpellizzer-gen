    "intro": "Rebutia corroana, commonly known as the coral bead cactus, is a species of cactus native to South America, particularly Argentina. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and its clusters of small, round, greenish-gray tubercles. The plant produces pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically borne at the areoles. Rebutia corroana is a slow-growing species that thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Its unique appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for collectors and succulent enthusiasts."
