    "intro": "Rhipsalis coriacea, commonly known as the rough rhipsalis, is a species of cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its branched, trailing stems covered in small, rough, spiny tubercles. The plant produces small, white flowers that are typically borne in clusters along the stems. It is a popular ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and ability to thrive in shaded environments. Rhipsalis coriacea is also valued for its air-purifying properties and ease of care."
