    "intro": "Rumex \u00d7 biformis, commonly known as the hybrid sorrel, is a perennial plant belonging to the Polygonaceae family. It is a natural hybrid between Rumex acetosa (common sorrel) and Rumex acetobipennis (broadleaf sorrel). The plant typically has heart-shaped leaves with a reddish or purple coloration on the veins, and it produces small, greenish flowers in clusters. It is often found in moist soils in meadows, along stream banks, and in woodland edges. Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits variability in morphology and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
