    "intro": "Rosa sempervirens globosa, commonly known as the globular rose, is a shrub-like species native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its dense, rounded growth habit and dark green, leathery leaves. The plant produces fragrant, semi-double pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is typically evergreen, with a compact form that makes it suitable for small garden spaces. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in Mediterranean climates where it thrives in well-drained soil and full sun."
