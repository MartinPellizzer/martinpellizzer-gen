    "intro": "Rhus refracta, commonly known as the smooth sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and turn bright red in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clustered inflorescences, followed by red, fuzzy berries that are an important food source for birds. Rhus refracta thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in dry, open woods or along roadsides. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a common and sometimes invasive species in certain regions."
