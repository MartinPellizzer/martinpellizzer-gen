    "intro": "Robiquetia tibetica, commonly known as the Tibetan bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Tibetan Plateau. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in rocky and alpine environments, adapting to the cold and arid conditions of its habitat. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss. Robiquetia tibetica is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique appearance."
