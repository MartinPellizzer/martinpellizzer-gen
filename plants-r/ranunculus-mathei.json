    "intro": "Ranunculus mathei, commonly known as the Alpine buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky areas, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant features bright yellow flowers with five petal-like sepals, which are often mistaken for true petals. Its leaves are deeply lobed and covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, greenish-yellow fruits that contain seeds. Ranunculus mathei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable growing conditions."
