    "intro": "Rhinanthus aristatus f. gracilis, commonly known as the slender yellow-rattle, is a flowering plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients while photosynthesizing on its own. The plant features delicate, slender stems and yellow flowers with a distinctive bilabiate corolla. It typically grows in grasslands and open habitats, often in association with grasses such as Lolium and Poa. Its ecological role includes supporting pollinators and contributing to the biodiversity of its habitat."
