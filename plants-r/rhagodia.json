    "intro": "Rhagodia, commonly known as the mountain everlasting or rock everlasting, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It consists of several species, primarily found in Australia, with some species also occurring in New Zealand and southern Africa. These plants are typically shrubs or subshrubs, characterized by their small, often hairy leaves and compact, showy flower heads. The flowers are usually yellow or orange, and they bloom in spring or summer. Rhagodia species are adapted to grow in dry, rocky or sandy soils, making them resilient to harsh environmental conditions."
