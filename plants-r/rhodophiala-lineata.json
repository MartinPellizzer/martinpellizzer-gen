    "intro": "Rhodophiala lineata, commonly known as the zigzag orchid, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its unique, zigzag-shaped stems. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, often with a yellowish throat. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a delicate and less commonly cultivated species."
