    "intro": "Rhus pulchella, commonly known as the silky dogwood, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It features opposite, ovate leaves that are typically gray-green on the upper surface and white on the underside, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries that attract birds. Its bark is smooth and light gray, and it often grows in moist, wooded areas. Rhus pulchella is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological benefits in native plant gardens."
