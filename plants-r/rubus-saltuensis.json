    "intro": "Rubus saltuensis, commonly known as the salt marsh raspberry, is a shrub native to coastal regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its prickly stems and compound leaves, which are adapted to tolerate salty and windy environments. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or yellow in color, often used in local cuisines. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in salt marshes and coastal dunes. Due to its ecological importance, it plays a key role in stabilizing coastal habitats and supporting local wildlife."
