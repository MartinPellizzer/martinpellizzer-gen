    "intro": "Rhamnus pumila var. villarsiana, commonly known as the dwarf buckthorn, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically reaches a height of about 30 centimeters and has small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually covered in a fine layer of white or gray hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring, followed by dark blue berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. This variant is distinguished by its compact growth habit and unique leaf morphology compared to other Rhamnus species."
