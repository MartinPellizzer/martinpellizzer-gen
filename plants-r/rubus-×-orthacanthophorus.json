    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 orthacanthophorus, commonly known as the blackberry bramble, is a hybrid species within the Rubus genus, characterized by its thorny stems and aggregate fruits. It typically grows in temperate regions, thriving in well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight. The plant produces dark purple to black berries that are rich in antioxidants and often used in culinary applications. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it is known for its vigorous growth habit. Due to its invasive potential in some areas, it is often managed carefully in natural habitats."
