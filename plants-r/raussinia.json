    "intro": "Raussinia, commonly known as the Indian rosewood, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae. It consists of several species, primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Pacific Islands. The plants are characterized by their evergreen leaves, which are typically opposite and elliptic in shape. Raussinia species produce small, fragrant flowers that are often white or pink, arranged in clusters. These plants are valued for their hard, durable wood, which is used in traditional crafts and furniture making."
