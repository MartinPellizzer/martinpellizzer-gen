    "intro": "Rhodococcum vitis-idaea subsp. minus, commonly known as the lesser crowfoot, is a member of the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. It features small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May, depending on the climate. The plant has trifoliate leaves composed of three oval to ovate leaflets, and its stems are often covered with fine, soft hairs. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. This subspecies is closely related to other members of the Vitis-idaea complex and is notable for its ecological role in nutrient cycling and habitat support for various invertebrates."
