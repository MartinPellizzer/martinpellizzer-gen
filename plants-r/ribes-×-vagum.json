It is a natural hybrid between Ribes nigrum (blackcurrant) and Ribes rubrum (redcurrant), resulting in a plant that exhibits characteristics of both parents. The leaves are alternate, ovate to elliptic, with serrated margins and a dark green upper surface. It produces small, aggregate fruits that range in color from yellow to red, depending on the variety. The plant is often cultivated for its edible berries and is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental qualities."
