    "intro": "Rosa silverhielmii, commonly known as the silver-helm rose, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its silvery-white undersides on its leaves, which give it its distinctive appearance. The plant produces fragrant, single or semi-double pink flowers that bloom in late summer. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
