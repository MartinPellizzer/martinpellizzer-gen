    "intro": "Ranunculus gyratifrons, commonly known as the spiral buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive spiral arrangement of leaves, which gives it its scientific name. The plant produces bright yellow flowers with five to eight petals, typical of the Ranunculaceae family. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
