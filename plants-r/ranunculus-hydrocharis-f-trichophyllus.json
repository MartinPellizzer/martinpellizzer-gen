    "intro": "Ranunculus hydrocharis f. trichophyllus, commonly known as the hairy water crowfoot, is a botanical variant of the water crowfoot species. It is a aquatic or semi-aquatic plant characterized by its finely divided, floating leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant typically produces small, yellowish flowers with five petals, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes. Its hairy foliage is an adaptation that may help in reducing water loss and protecting against herbivory."
