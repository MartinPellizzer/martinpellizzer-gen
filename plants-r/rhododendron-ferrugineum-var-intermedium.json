    "intro": "Rhododendron ferrugineum var. intermedium, commonly known as the Alpine rose or the dwarf alpine rhododendron, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to red. The plant typically grows in acidic, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist climates at high altitudes. It is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it forms part of the mountain flora. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in temperate regions."
