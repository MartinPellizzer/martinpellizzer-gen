It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces small, fragrant pink flowers in late summer. The plant has needle-like leaves and is adapted to survive in harsh, alpine environments. It is listed as critically endangered due to habitat loss and climate change. Rosa smolandica plays an important role in the ecological balance of its native Arctic ecosystems."
