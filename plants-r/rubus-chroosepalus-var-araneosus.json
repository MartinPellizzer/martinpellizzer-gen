It is characterized by its small, aggregate fruits that resemble raspberries but have a unique, fibrous texture. The plant produces compound leaves with serrated edges and has thorny stems typical of many Rubus species. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, and it blooms in early summer. The plant is often found in woodland edges and moist habitats, where it thrives in partial shade."
