    "intro": "Randia chromocarpa, commonly known as the red randia, is a shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are typically dark green with a slightly pubescent surface. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by red, fleshy berries that are a notable feature of the species. These berries are edible and have a tangy flavor, often used in local cuisines. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant fruit and foliage."
