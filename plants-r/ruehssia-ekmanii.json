    "intro": "Ruehssia ekmanii, commonly known as the Ekman's ruehssia, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many flowering plants known for their ornamental and medicinal value. The plant is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ruehssia ekmanii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
