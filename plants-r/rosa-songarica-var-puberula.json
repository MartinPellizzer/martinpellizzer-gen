    "intro": "Rosa songarica var. puberula, commonly known as the Siberian rose or Mongolian rose, is a deciduous shrub native to the cold climates of Siberia and Mongolia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and oval, dark green leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces fragrant, pink to white flowers in late spring to early summer, which are often used in traditional medicine. It is adapted to harsh environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is cultivated in botanical gardens and by horticulturists in temperate regions."
