    "intro": "Rubus mollicellus, commonly known as the soft-leaved blackberry, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and hairy, soft leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, white to pink flowers in the spring, which are followed by edible blackberries in the summer. Its fruit is typically small, tart, and covered in a fine layer of whitish bloom. Rubus mollicellus is often found in moist, disturbed habitats such as streambanks and meadows."
