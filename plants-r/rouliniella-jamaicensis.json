    "intro": "Rouliniella jamaicensis, commonly known as the Jamaican spider orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the Caribbean. It is characterized by its intricate, spider-like appearance, with long, thin petals that resemble the legs of a spider. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in rocky or forested areas. Its flowers are usually pale green or yellow, with a distinctive, elongated shape. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
