    "intro": "Ruellia repens var. kouytcheensis, commonly known as the creeping ruellia, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, velvety texture. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in shades of blue or purple, which are typically arranged in clusters at the leaf axils. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to form dense ground cover in suitable climates."
