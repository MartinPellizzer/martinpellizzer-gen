    "intro": "Rhododendron paludosum, commonly known as the swamp rhododendron, is a deciduous shrub native to the wetlands of eastern North America. It typically grows in moist, acidic soils and thrives in swampy or boggy environments. The plant features showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are leathery and elliptical, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Rhododendron paludosum plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
