    "intro": "Robinia sophorifolia, commonly known as the yellowwood tree, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and compound leaves that are pinnately arranged with oval-shaped leaflets. The tree produces small, yellowish-white flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by long, narrow pods that contain flat, dark seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to tolerate various environmental conditions."
