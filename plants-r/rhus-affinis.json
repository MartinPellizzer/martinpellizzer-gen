    "intro": "Rhus affinis, commonly known as staghorn sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are arranged in pairs along the stems, and its distinctive reddish-brown, fuzzy fruits that appear in clusters. The plant is often found in moist, disturbed soils along stream banks and in woodland edges. Its leaves and fruits are used in traditional medicine and as a source of edible berries. Rhus affinis plays an important ecological role by providing food and habitat for various wildlife species."
