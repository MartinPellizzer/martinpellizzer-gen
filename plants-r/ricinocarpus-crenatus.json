    "intro": "Ricinocarpus crenatus, commonly known as the serrated ricinberry, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Asia and Australia. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, serrated leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces berries that contain toxic compounds, including ricin, making it potentially hazardous to humans and animals. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests and swampy areas. Despite its toxicity, it plays a role in local ecosystems and has been studied for its chemical properties."
