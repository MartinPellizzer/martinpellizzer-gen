    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 agnatus, commonly known as the blackberry raspberry, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Rubus ursinus (the blackberry) and Rubus idaeus (the red raspberry). It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves, typical of the Rubus genus. The plant produces aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black in color, with a tart and slightly sweet flavor. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its edible berries. Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits a mix of traits from both parent species, making it a unique and versatile plant in horticulture."
