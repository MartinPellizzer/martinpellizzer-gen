    "intro": "Rubus rivularis var. speluncarum, commonly known as the cave raspberry, is a rare variant of the brambles found in subterranean environments. It thrives in dark, humid conditions typical of caves and rock crevices, where it relies on limited light for photosynthesis. The plant has adapted to low-light conditions with elongated, slender leaves and small, clustered flowers. Its fruits are typically smaller and more acidic than those of its surface-dwelling relatives. Due to its specialized habitat, it is considered an endangered species with limited distribution."
