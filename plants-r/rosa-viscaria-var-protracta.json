    "intro": "Rosa viscaria var. protracta, commonly known as the creeping pink rose, is a low-growing shrub native to eastern North America. It features slender, arching stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant produces fragrant, pink flowers with five petals, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its foliage consists of dark green, oval-shaped leaves with serrated edges. This variety is well-suited for ground cover in woodland or shady garden settings."
