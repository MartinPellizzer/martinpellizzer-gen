    "intro": "Ramusia nyctaginea, commonly known as the nightshade ramusia, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and peppers. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that bloom at night, a trait that aids in pollination by nocturnal insects. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with a slightly hairy texture, and it produces small, berry-like fruits. Due to its unique nocturnal blooming habit and potential medicinal properties, it is of interest to botanists and herbalists alike."
