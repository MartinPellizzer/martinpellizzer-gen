    "intro": "Rosa tomentosa var. urceolata, commonly known as the woolly rose or cushion rose, is a compact, shrub-like plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features dense, mat-forming growth with soft, fuzzy gray foliage that provides insulation against harsh climates. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink to white, typically blooming in early summer. Its unique morphology, including its cushion-like structure, makes it well-suited for rock gardens and alpine settings. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to rocky, well-drained soils."
