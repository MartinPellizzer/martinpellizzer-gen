    "intro": "Rubus parvifraxinifoliolus, commonly known as the small-leaved blackberry, is a species of brambles belonging to the Rubus genus in the family Rosaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically small and have a serrated edge. The plant produces aggregate fruits, known as drupes, which are usually dark purple to black in color when mature. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils. Due to its ornamental and edible qualities, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and small-scale agriculture."
