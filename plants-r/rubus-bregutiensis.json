    "intro": "Rubus bregutiensis, commonly known as the Bregutiensis bramble, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Europe, particularly in parts of the Balkans. The plant is characterized by its thorny stems, trifoliate leaves, and clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers. Its fruits, which are aggregate berries, are typically red when mature and are edible. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
