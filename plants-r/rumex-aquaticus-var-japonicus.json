    "intro": "Rumex aquaticus var. japonicus, commonly known as Japanese water sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to East Asia. It typically grows in wet or marshy environments, such as pond edges and stream banks, and thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant features trifoliate leaves with a glossy, waxy surface and small, greenish-yellow flowers that appear in early spring. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread easily, forming dense colonies in suitable habitats. The plant is often used in traditional medicine and as a culinary herb due to its tart, lemony flavor."
