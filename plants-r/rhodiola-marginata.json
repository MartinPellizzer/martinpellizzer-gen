    "intro": "Rhodiola marginata, commonly known as the alpine rhodiola, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Crassulaceae and is characterized by its fleshy, succulent leaves and small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, often in alpine or subalpine environments. It is adapted to cold climates and can survive in harsh, arid conditions due to its ability to store water in its leaves. Rhodiola marginata is also known for its medicinal properties and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported adaptogenic effects."
