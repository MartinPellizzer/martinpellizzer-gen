    "intro": "Rubus obscurus var. caligans, commonly known as the blackberry shrub, is a species of brambles native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its trailing or scrambling growth habit and produces small, dark berries that are typically not as flavorful as those of other Rubus species. The plant has compound leaves with three to five leaflets, and its flowers are usually pale pink or white. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species."
