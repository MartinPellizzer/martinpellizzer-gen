    "intro": "Rubus cuspidiferus var. aprutius, commonly known as the prairie raspberry, is a variant of the common blackberry. It is a deciduous shrub native to North America, particularly found in prairie and open woodland habitats. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or black in color, depending on the stage of ripening. Its leaves are palmately compound, with serrated edges, and it has thorny stems typical of the Rubus genus. It plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing food for wildlife and stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
