    "intro": "Rochelia retrosepala, commonly known as the backward-sheathed rochelia, is a rare and unique member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive, sheathed leaves that curve backward, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces small, white flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. It is native to specific regions in South America, particularly in Argentina and Chile. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Rochelia retrosepala is considered a species of conservation concern."
