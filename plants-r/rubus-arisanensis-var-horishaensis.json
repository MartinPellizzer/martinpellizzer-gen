It is a shrub characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red when mature, containing numerous drupelets. It thrives in mountainous regions with well-drained soil and partial shade. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
