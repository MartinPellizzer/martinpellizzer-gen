It features upright, woody stems that are covered in a dense layer of pale green to reddish-brown bark. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink to white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are oval-shaped, serrated, and covered in a fine layer of hair, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. This variety is well adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, making it a hardy plant suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings."
