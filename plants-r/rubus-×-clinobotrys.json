It is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Rubus ursinus (the blackberry) and Rubus idaeus (the red raspberry). This species exhibits characteristics of both parent plants, featuring thorny stems and compound leaves. The flowers are typically pink or white, and the fruit is a aggregate of drupes, commonly referred to as a raspberry. It is cultivated for its edible berries, which have a tart flavor and are used in jams, pies, and other culinary applications."
