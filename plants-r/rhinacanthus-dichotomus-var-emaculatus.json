    "intro": "Rhinacanthus dichotomus var. emaculatus, commonly known as the emaculate flame tree, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, pinnately compound leaves with a striking contrast between dark green and pale green segments. The plant produces small, fragrant yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by orange-red, fleshy fruits. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The varietal form emaculatus is notable for its reduced leaf size and more delicate appearance compared to the typical species."
