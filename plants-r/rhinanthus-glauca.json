    "intro": "Rhinanthus glauca, commonly known as the blue knapweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, which includes parasitic and hemiparasitic species. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Its flowers are small, blue to purple in color, and are arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. Rhinanthus glauca plays a role in supporting pollinators and is often found in habitats that have been lightly disturbed or maintained."
