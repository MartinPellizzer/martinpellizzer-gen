It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom underwater. This variety is native to the coastal regions of the southeastern United States, particularly Florida. It plays a crucial role in stabilizing sediment and providing habitat for aquatic organisms. Its adaptability to fluctuating salinity levels makes it an important component of estuarine ecosystems."
