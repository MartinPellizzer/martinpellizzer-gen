It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on trees or rocks in tropical climates. The plant features long, slender stems with small, rounded leaves that help reduce water loss. Its flowers are white or pale pink, often appearing in clusters, and it produces small, red berries that are edible for some animals. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and ability to adapt to indoor growing conditions."
