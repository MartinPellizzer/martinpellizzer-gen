    "intro": "Reynosia affinis, commonly known as the California buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It features compound leaves with three to five leaflets, which are typically lance-shaped and have a smooth or slightly serrated margin. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by dark purple, egg-shaped berries that are a food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal scrub and chaparral habitats. Reynosia affinis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native plant landscapes."
