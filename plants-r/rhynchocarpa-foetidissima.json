    "intro": "Rhynchocarpa foetidissima, commonly known as the stinking boxwood, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in coastal areas and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage. The plant produces small, white flowers that are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It is notable for its strong, unpleasant odor, which is particularly noticeable when the fruits are mature. This plant is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value despite its pungent scent."
