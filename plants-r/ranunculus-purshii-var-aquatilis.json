    "intro": "Ranunculus purshii var. aquatilis, commonly known as the water buttercup, is a variant of the buttercup genus characterized by its aquatic or semi-aquatic habitat. It typically features delicate, bright yellow flowers with five petals, often surrounded by sepals that resemble additional petals. The plant has slender, hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves that are usually submerged or floating. It thrives in wetland environments, such as marshes and the edges of ponds. Its botanical significance lies in its adaptation to aquatic conditions and its role in wetland ecosystems."
