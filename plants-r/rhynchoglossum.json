    "intro": "Rhynchoglossum, commonly known as the horned lily, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Melanthiaceae. It is characterized by its unique, often tubular or horn-shaped flowers that are typically bright red or orange in color. The plant is native to parts of North America, particularly in the western United States and southern Canada. Rhynchoglossum species are perennial herbs that grow in dry, rocky habitats, often in open woodlands or grasslands. The flowers are adapted for pollination by bees and other insects, with their structure facilitating the transfer of pollen."
