    "intro": "Rosa pisocarpa subsp. pisocarpa, commonly known as the Kauai rose, is a shrub native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers. The plant produces small, red, fleshy fruits that are edible and used in traditional Hawaiian cuisine. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in coastal forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
