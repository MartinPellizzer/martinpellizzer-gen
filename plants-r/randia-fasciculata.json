It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 2\u20135 meters, characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for some animals. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in moist, well-drained soils in coastal areas or lowland forests."
