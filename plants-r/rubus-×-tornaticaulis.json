    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 tornaticaulis, commonly known as the blackberry raspberry, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Rubus ursinus (the blackberry) and Rubus chamaemorus (the cloudberry). It is a perennial shrub characterized by its thorny stems and aggregate fruits that resemble both blackberries and raspberries. The plant produces small, yellow-orange berries that are typically tart and acidic, with a unique flavor profile. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in wetlands, meadows, and forest edges. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a natural hybrid that showcases the genetic diversity within the Rubus genus."
