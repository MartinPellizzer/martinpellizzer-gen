    "intro": "Rhynchosia schenckii, commonly known as the yellow burr legume, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and South America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its distinctive pod fruits and nitrogen-fixing abilities. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces vibrant yellow flowers with a unique spurred structure. Its seeds are encased in a spiny, woody pod, which aids in seed dispersal by attaching to animal fur or clothing. Rhynchosia schenckii is often found in disturbed habitats and is used in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
