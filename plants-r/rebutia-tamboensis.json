    "intro": "Rebutia tamboensis, commonly known as the Tamboena prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to South America, specifically found in Argentina and Chile. It is a low-growing, mat-forming plant with short, cylindrical stems that are typically covered in spiny areoles. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the summer months, which are followed by edible, red, fleshy fruits. Its leaves are usually reduced to spines, and it is well adapted to arid environments. Rebutia tamboensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance in landscaping."
