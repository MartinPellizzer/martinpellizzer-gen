It is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, greenish-white flowers that are arranged in dense inflorescences. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded woodland areas. This subspecies is distinguished by its slightly smaller leaves and shorter stems compared to the typical R. acetosella."
