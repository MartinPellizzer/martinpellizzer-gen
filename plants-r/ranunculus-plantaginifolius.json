    "intro": "Ranunculus plantaginifolius, commonly known as the creeping buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a basal rosette of lance-shaped, hairy leaves that are often covered in fine, yellowish pubescence. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with five petals and numerous stamens, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats."
