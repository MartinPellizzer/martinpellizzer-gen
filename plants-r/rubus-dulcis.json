    "intro": "Rubus dulcis, commonly known as the blackberry plant, is a member of the Rosaceae family and is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves, which typically have five to seven leaflets. The plant produces aggregate fruits composed of small, drupe-like berries that ripen to a dark purple or black color. These berries are rich in antioxidants and are widely cultivated for their sweet, flavorful pulp. The plant's botanical features make it both ecologically significant and economically valuable in agriculture."
