    "intro": "Rubus horridus var. flexuosus, commonly known as the bristly blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, dark purple to black berries. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and shrublands. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges and a hairy texture. The berries are edible but have a tart flavor and are often used in jams and preserves."
