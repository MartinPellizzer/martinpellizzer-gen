It is characterized by its upright growth habit and thorny stems, which are typical of many rose species. The plant produces fragrant, pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are pinnately compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets. Rosa cretica is well adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal and arid environments."
