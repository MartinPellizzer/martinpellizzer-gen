It features lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are typically narrow and leathery. The plant produces dense clusters of pink to reddish-purple flowers in the spring. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its invasive potential, it is often considered a problematic species in certain ecosystems."
