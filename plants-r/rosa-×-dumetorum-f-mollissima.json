    "intro": "Rosa \u00d7 dumetorum f. mollissima, commonly known as the softleaf dog\u73ab\u7470, is a cultivar of the rose family characterized by its dense, velvety foliage. It is a hybrid species, resulting from the cross between Rosa rugosa and Rosa multiflora, and is prized for its compact growth habit. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It is well-suited for garden use as a shrub or hedge due to its hardiness and resistance to diseases. The leaves are notably softer and more hairy than those of many other rose varieties, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
