    "intro": "Rubus tomentosus var. subparilis, commonly known as the woolly blackberry, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and thorny stems, which are typical of the Rubus genus. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that ripen to a dark purple or black color, often used in local foraging and traditional practices. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and native plant gardens."
