    "intro": "Rosa antonowii, commonly known as the Antanoa rose, is a rare and endemic species native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its striking, deep red flowers with a velvety texture and a strong, sweet fragrance. The plant typically grows as a shrub with thorny stems and dark green, lobed leaves. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
