    "intro": "Robiquetia ascendens, commonly known as the ascending robiquetia, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae, which includes milkweeds and related species. The plant is characterized by its erect, branching stems and clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. Its leaves are opposite and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Robiquetia ascendens is often cultivated for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
