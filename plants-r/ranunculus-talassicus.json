It is characterized by its delicate, yellowish flowers with five petals and a hairy, glandular stem. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines and cliffs. Its leaves are palmately divided and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in coastal environments.
