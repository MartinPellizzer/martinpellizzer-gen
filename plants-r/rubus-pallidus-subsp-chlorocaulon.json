    "intro": "Rubus pallidus subsp. chlorocaulon, commonly known as the pale bramble, is a shrub native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its slender, thorny stems and small, trifoliate leaves. The flowers are typically white or pale pink, with five petals, and appear in clusters. The plant produces edible berries, though they are generally less palatable than those of other Rubus species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
