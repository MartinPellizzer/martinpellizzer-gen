    "intro": "Rosa pomifera var. recondita, commonly known as the wild rose of the Caucasus, is a rare and ancient species native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It is characterized by its thorny stems, compound leaves, and fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces edible hips, which are rich in vitamin C and have been used in traditional medicine. Its botanical significance lies in its genetic diversity and potential for hybridization with other Rosa species. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
