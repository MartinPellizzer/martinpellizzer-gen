    "intro": "Rubus schnelleri var. pilosus, commonly known as the hairy blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and thorny stems, which are typical features of the Rubus genus. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are edible but often have a tart flavor. Its growth habit is shrub-like, with multiple stems arising from the base, and it thrives in well-drained soils. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its fruit in suitable climates."
