    "intro": "Russelia staleyae, commonly known as the Staley's russelia, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is a shrub that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in cloud forests. The plant produces striking, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange, attracting pollinators like hummingbirds and bees. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its unique appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Russelia staleyae is considered a rare and endangered species."
