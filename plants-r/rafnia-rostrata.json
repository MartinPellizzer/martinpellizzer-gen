    "intro": "Rafnia rostrata, commonly known as the rostrated sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Africa and Asia. It typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of pale yellow flowers. Rafnia rostrata is characterized by its distinctive rosette-like growth habit and its ability to form dense colonies. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
