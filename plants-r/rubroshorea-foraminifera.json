    "intro": "Rubroshorea foraminifera, commonly known as the red-shore foraminifera, is a unicellular protist belonging to the phylum Foraminifera. It is characterized by its intricate calcareous or siliceous shell, which is often ornamented with delicate spines or pores. This organism thrives in marine environments, particularly in shallow coastal waters where it plays a role in sediment formation. Its ability to filter feed on plankton and organic matter contributes to nutrient cycling in marine ecosystems. Due to its sensitivity to environmental changes, it is also used as an indicator species for water quality and climate change impacts."
