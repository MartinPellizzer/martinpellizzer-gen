    "intro": "Rhus fastigiata, commonly known as the narrowleaf sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and compound leaves that are pinnately arranged with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by red, fuzzy berries that are a food source for birds and wildlife. Its bark is smooth and reddish-brown, becoming fissured with age, and it is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value. Rhus fastigiata is adapted to a variety of soil types and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
