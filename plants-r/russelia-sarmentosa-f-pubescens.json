It is a perennial shrub characterized by its trailing growth habit and hairy stems, which give it its specific epithet \"pubescens.\" The plant produces clusters of vibrant orange-red tubular flowers, which are highly attractive to hummingbirds and other pollinators. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered with fine pubescence, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes."
