    "intro": "Rhamnus smithii var. mulleri, commonly known as the Smith's buckthorn, is a shrub native to specific regions of California. It is characterized by its small, oval leaves that are typically glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by dark blue berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in chaparral and coastal scrub habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and sensitive species in its native range."
