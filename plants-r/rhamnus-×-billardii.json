    "intro": "Rhamnus \u00d7 billardii, commonly known as the hybrid common buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its small, dark green leaves and black, berry-like fruits. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It has been introduced to North America, where it sometimes becomes invasive due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in various soil types. The berries are an important food source for birds and small mammals."
