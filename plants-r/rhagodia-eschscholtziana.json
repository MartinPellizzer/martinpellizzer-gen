It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and small, blue or violet flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal areas, preferring sandy or gravelly soils and full sun exposure.

Rhagodia eschscholtziana is adapted to tolerate saline conditions and is an important component of coastal ecosystems."
