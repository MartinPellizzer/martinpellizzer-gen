    "intro": "Rubus lasiocarpus var. pauciflorus, commonly known as the sparse-flowered bramble, is a shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its thorny stems and trifoliate leaves, which are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers in clusters, followed by edible, raspberry-like berries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and streamside areas. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
