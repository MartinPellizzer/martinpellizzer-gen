    "intro": "Rubus ignoratus, commonly known as the unknown raspberry, is a species of bramble native to certain regions of North America. It belongs to the Rosaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like roses and strawberries. The plant is characterized by its trailing growth habit and produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red when ripe. Its leaves are compound, with three to five leaflets, and the flowers are usually white or pale pink. Due to its limited study, much about its ecological role and propagation remains unknown."
