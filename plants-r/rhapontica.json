    "intro": "Rhapontica, commonly known as the common rhubarb, is a perennial plant belonging to the Polygonaceae family. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stalks and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant is native to Europe and Asia and thrives in temperate climates. Its stalks are edible when cooked, though the leaves contain oxalic acid and are toxic. Rhapontica is often cultivated for its culinary and ornamental value in gardens."
