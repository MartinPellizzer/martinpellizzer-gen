    "intro": "Rotala thymoides var. thymoides, commonly known as the dwarf rotala, is a compact aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It features small, rounded leaves that are typically bright green, often with a reddish tinge under bright light. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous white flowers that appear in clusters, though they are not showy. It thrives in freshwater environments and is often used in aquariums for its dense foliage and ease of care. Its slow growth rate makes it suitable for foreground planting in planted tanks."
