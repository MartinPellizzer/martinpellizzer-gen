    "intro": "Rubus egregius var. pliocenicus, commonly known as the Pliocene raspberry, is a rare, extinct variant of the raspberry genus native to prehistoric North America. This plant is characterized by its biennial growth habit, producing large, aggregate fruits that were likely consumed by early megafauna. Its leaves are deeply lobed, with a serrated margin, and it thrives in moist, temperate climates. The plant's flowers are pinkish-white, with five sepals and numerous stamens, typical of the Rubus genus. Fossil records suggest it played a significant role in the ecological dynamics of the Pliocene epoch."
