    "intro": "Rubus avaloniensis, commonly known as the Avalon blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the British Isles. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically harvested in late summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and hedgerows. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and protected species in its native range."
