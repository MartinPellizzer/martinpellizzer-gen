    "intro": "Rhyncholacis, commonly known as the horned violets, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Violaceae. These plants are characterized by their distinctive, spurred flowers that resemble small horns, giving them their common name. Rhyncholacis species typically have heart-shaped leaves and produce showy, violet-colored blooms. They are native to various regions in South America, particularly in the Andes. Due to their ornamental value, some species are cultivated in gardens, though they are relatively rare in horticulture."
