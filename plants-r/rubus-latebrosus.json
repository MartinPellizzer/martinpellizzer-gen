    "intro": "Rubus latebrosus, commonly known as the blackberry shrub, is a species of bramble native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, white flowers that develop into edible blackberries, which are rich in antioxidants. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Rubus latebrosus plays an important role in supporting local wildlife by providing food and shelter."
