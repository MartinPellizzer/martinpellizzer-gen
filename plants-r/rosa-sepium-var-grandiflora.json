    "intro": "Rosa sepium var. grandiflora, commonly known as the Chinese rose, is a deciduous shrub native to China and Korea. It is characterized by its fragrant, semi-double pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has dark green, serrated leaves and produces red, hairy fruits known as hips. It is well-suited for hedges or as a specimen plant due to its compact growth habit. Rosa sepium var. grandiflora is relatively low maintenance and thrives in full sun to partial shade."
