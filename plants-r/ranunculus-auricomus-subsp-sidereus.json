    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus subsp. sidereus, commonly known as the silverleaf buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features delicate, palmately divided leaves with a distinctive silvery underside, which gives it its common name. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with five to seven petals, often with a dark central blotch. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens but is considered vulnerable in its native habitat."
