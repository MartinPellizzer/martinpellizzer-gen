    "intro": "Rhus rimosa, commonly known as the staghorn sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 5 to 11 pairs of oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into red, fuzzy fruits in the fall. Its bark is rough and ridged, with a distinctive, horn-like appearance on younger stems. Rhus rimosa is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to a wide range of environmental conditions."
