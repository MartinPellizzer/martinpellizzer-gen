    "intro": "Rosa graveolens f. calcarea, commonly known as the rock rose, is a botanical variant of the Rosa graveolens species. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and is well adapted to rocky and arid environments. The plant produces fragrant, pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically gray-green, with a fuzzy texture that helps reduce water loss. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil."
