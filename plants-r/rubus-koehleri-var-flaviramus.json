    "intro": "Rubus koehleri var. flaviramus, commonly known as the yellow-stemmed blackberry, is a variant of the Rubus genus native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, upright shrubs and small, aggregate fruits that range in color from red to black. The leaves are typically trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the plant produces yellowish-white flowers in the spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The fruit is edible, though generally less palatable than other blackberry varieties."
