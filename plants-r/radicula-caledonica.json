    "intro": "Radicula caledonica, commonly known as the Scottish heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Scottish Highlands. It features small, needle-like leaves that are typically dark green and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped white flowers in the spring, which are pollinated by insects. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in poor, acidic soils. Radicula caledonica is well adapted to harsh, wind-swept environments and is often found in heathland and moorland habitats."
