    "intro": "Rubus macrophyllus subsp. leucomacrophyllus, commonly known as the white-leafed raspberry, is a shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its large, white-veined leaves that are distinctly different from the typical red-veined leaves of other Rubus species. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or yellow when mature. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its botanical features make it a unique and valuable species for ecological studies and horticultural interest."
