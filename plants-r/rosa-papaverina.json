    "intro": "Rosa papaverina, commonly known as the Turk's Turban, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, large, saucer-shaped pink or red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a shrub-like appearance with thorny stems and dark green, serrated leaves. Its botanical name, Rosa papaverina, reflects its resemblance to the poppy family, though it belongs to the rose family, Rosaceae. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has a long history of use in traditional medicine."
