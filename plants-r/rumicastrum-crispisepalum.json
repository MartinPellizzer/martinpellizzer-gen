    "intro": "Rumicastrum crispisepalum, commonly known as the coastal sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the sandy coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is adapted to harsh, saline environments and thrives in well-drained soils. Its small, papery fruits disperse seeds by wind, aiding in its spread along coastal dunes. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sand dunes and providing habitat for local wildlife."
