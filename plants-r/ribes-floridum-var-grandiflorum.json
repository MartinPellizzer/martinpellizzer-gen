    "intro": "Ribes floridum var. grandiflorum, commonly known as the Florida gooseberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features compound leaves with 5 to 9 elliptical leaflets, often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, which are followed by edible, bright red berries in the summer. These berries are typically tart and are used in jams and jellies. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks."
