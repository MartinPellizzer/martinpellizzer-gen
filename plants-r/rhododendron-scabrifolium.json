    "intro": "Rhododendron scabrifolium, commonly known as the roughleaf rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves that are covered in fine, raised bumps, giving them a rough texture. The plant produces clusters of showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. This evergreen shrub is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and woodland settings."
