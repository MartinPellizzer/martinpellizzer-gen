    "intro": "Ranunculus dichotomus var. limnobius, commonly known as the water buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland habitats in North America. It features delicate, yellow flowers with 5-7 sepals that resemble petals, and its leaves are deeply lobed with a distinctive, fern-like appearance. The plant thrives in moist or aquatic environments, often growing along the edges of ponds and streams. Its flowers bloom in early spring, and it is often found in association with other wetland flora. The species is notable for its ability to tolerate waterlogged soils and its role in supporting aquatic insect populations."
