    "intro": "Rhus vulgaris, commonly known as sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically pinnately arranged with 11 to 31 leaflets. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by red, fuzzy berries that are a food source for birds and other wildlife. Rhus vulgaris thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in woodlands, open fields, and disturbed areas. Its toxic properties make it important to handle with care, though it has historical uses in medicine and dye production."
