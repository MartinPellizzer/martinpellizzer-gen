    "intro": "Rosa mucronulata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rose, is a species native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Asia. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring thorny stems and pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces fragrant, single or semi-double flowers in shades of pink to white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its botanical features include stipules that are lanceolate and gradually narrow to a short apex, and it is often found in rocky or forested habitats. Rosa mucronulata is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its beauty and fragrance."
