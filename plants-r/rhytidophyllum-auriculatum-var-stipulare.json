    "intro": "Rhytidophyllum auriculatum var. stipulare, commonly known as the stipulate rhytidophyllum, is a rare and unique plant species characterized by its distinctive leaf morphology. Its leaves are typically narrow and elongated, with a waxy surface that aids in water retention in arid environments. The plant exhibits a shrub-like growth habit, often forming dense clusters to protect itself from harsh weather conditions. It produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pale green or white, which are adapted for pollination by specific insect species. The varietal name 'stipulare' refers to the presence of stipules\u2014small, leaf-like structures at the base of the leaf stalks, which are a key identifying feature of this variant."
