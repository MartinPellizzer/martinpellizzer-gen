    "intro": "Rosa pomifera f. franzonii, commonly known as the giant rose or the fruiting rose, is a unique horticultural form of the species Rosa pomifera. It is characterized by its large, edible rose hips that can grow up to 5 centimeters in diameter, making it distinct from typical roses. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or white, followed by the ornamental, berry-like fruits. It is a shrub that thrives in temperate climates and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is often cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
