    "intro": "Rhodalix, commonly known as the pink-flowered heath, is a member of the Ericaceae family, which includes evergreen shrubs and subshrubs. It is native to the temperate regions of southern Africa, particularly in the Western Cape. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit, with small, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine, white wax. Its most striking feature is its clusters of pink or magenta flowers, which bloom in late summer to early autumn. Rhodalix thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in rocky or coastal environments."
