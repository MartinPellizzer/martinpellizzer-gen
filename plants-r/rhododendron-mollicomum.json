    "intro": "Rhododendron mollicomum, commonly known as the silky rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage that is often covered in a fine, silky down, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces showy, clustered flowers that range in color from pale pink to deep red, typically blooming in late spring. It thrives in cool, humid climates and requires well-drained, acidic soil. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
