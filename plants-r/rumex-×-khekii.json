    "intro": "Rumex \u00d7 khekii, commonly known as the hybrid sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Polygonaceae family. It is a naturally occurring hybrid between Rumex acetosa (common sorrel) and Rumex acetobatus (water sorrel), resulting in a plant with distinctive botanical features. The leaves are typically heart-shaped with a reddish or purple coloration on the veins, and the plant produces small, greenish flowers in clustered inflorescences. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetland or marshy environments. Its botanical characteristics make it an interesting subject for studies on plant hybridization and adaptation."
