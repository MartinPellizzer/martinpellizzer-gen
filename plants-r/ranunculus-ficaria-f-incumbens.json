    "intro": "Ranunculus ficaria f. incumbens, commonly known as the creeping buttercup, is a low-growing perennial plant characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and bright yellow flowers. It thrives in moist, shady environments, often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. The plant produces small, hairy seed capsules that release seeds through a mechanism called explosive dehiscence. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, making it both a common weed and a valuable ground cover in certain habitats. The species is notable for its ability to tolerate wet conditions and its historical use in traditional medicine."
