It is a trailing shrub that produces small, edible berries, typically black when mature. The plant has trifoliate leaves with serrated edges and produces white to pale pink flowers in the spring. Its fruit is often used in jams and pies, similar to other Rubus species. The variant is distinguished by its slender petals and smaller fruit size compared to other blackberry varieties."
