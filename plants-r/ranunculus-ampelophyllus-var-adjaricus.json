    "intro": "Ranunculus ampelophyllus var. adjaricus, commonly known as the Adjarian buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Caucasus region. It features delicate, cup-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange, typically blooming in early spring. The plant has finely divided, trifoliate leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
