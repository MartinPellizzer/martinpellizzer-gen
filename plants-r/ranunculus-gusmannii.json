    "intro": "Ranunculus gusmannii, commonly known as the Andean buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the Andes mountains of South America. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family, characterized by its showy, often brightly colored flowers. The plant typically has simple, palmately lobed leaves and produces flowers with five to eight sepals that resemble petals. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in high-altitude meadows. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be sensitive to frost and requires well-drained soil."
