    "intro": "Rosa chlorinummulariifolia, commonly known as the green-leafed mallow rose, is a unique hybrid plant that combines characteristics of both roses and mallows. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically a deep green, giving it a distinct appearance compared to traditional roses. The plant produces small, delicate flowers in shades of white and pink, often with a subtle fragrance. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for garden cultivation. Due to its hybrid nature, it is relatively rare and often found in botanical gardens or specialized collections."
