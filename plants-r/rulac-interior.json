    "intro": "Rulac interior, commonly known as the desert lily, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant has adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through deep root systems and succulent leaves that store water. It blooms primarily in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The flowers are often followed by capsule fruits that release seeds when mature."
