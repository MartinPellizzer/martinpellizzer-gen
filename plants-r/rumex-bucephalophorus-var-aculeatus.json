    "intro": "Rumex bucephalophorus var. aculeatus, commonly known as the prickly sorrel, is a variant of the sorrel plant native to certain regions of North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, sharply toothed leaves and small, reddish flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are edible but contain oxalic acid, which can be harmful in large quantities. The variety is distinguished by its more pronounced spines along the leaf margins compared to the typical form."
