    "intro": "Rumex acetosa var. hydrophilus, commonly known as water sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to moist environments. It features upright, slender stems with broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, typically blooming in early spring. Its leaves are edible and have a sour, tangy flavor due to their high content of oxalic acid. It thrives in wet soils and is often found near streams, marshes, and other waterlogged areas."
