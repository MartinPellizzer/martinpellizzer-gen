    "intro": "Rubus molestus, commonly known as the rough blackberry, is a species of brambles belonging to the Rubus genus in the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its thorny stems and dark purple to black berries that ripen in late summer. The plant is native to parts of Europe and Asia, where it thrives in woodland edges and disturbed soils. Its leaves are typically trifoliate, with serrated edges, and its flowers are small, white, and clustered in umbels. The fruit is edible but often has a tart flavor, making it a subject of both culinary and ecological interest."
