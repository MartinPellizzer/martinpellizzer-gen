    "intro": "Ranunculus dissectus subsp. sibthorpii, commonly known as the Sibthorp's divided buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a basal rosette of deeply lobed, dissected leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces showy yellow flowers with five sepals and numerous stamens, typical of the Ranunculaceae family. It thrives in moist, temperate climates and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky soils. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
