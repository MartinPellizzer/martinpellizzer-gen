    "intro": "Rhus albomarginata, commonly known as the white-margin boxwood, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage with leaves that have white margins and a dark green center. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits that are edible for birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. Due to its slow growth and compact form, it is often used as a foundation plant or in formal gardens."
