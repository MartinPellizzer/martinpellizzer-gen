    "intro": "Rumex dioscoridis, commonly known as the common sorrel, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Polygonaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive heart-shaped leaves with a reddish or purple coloration on the underside. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in early spring. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist, shaded environments. Rumex dioscoridis is often found in woodland edges, stream banks, and disturbed soils."
