    "intro": "Rhododendron caloxanthum, commonly known as the golden rhododendron, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its showy, funnel-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often with a reddish or pinkish tinge. The plant typically grows in acidic, well-drained soils and thrives in partial to full shade. Its leaves are glossy and elliptical, providing a striking contrast to its vibrant floral display. Rhododendron caloxanthum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in cooler climates."
