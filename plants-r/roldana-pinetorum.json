    "intro": "Roldana pinetorum, commonly known as the pine forest bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Its leaves are elongated and covered in a fine, silvery-white pubescence, which helps to reduce water loss in dry conditions. Roldana pinetorum is often found in association with pine forests, where it plays a role in the local ecosystem by providing nectar for pollinators."
