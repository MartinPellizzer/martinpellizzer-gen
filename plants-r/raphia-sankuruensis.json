    "intro": "Raphia sankuruensis, commonly known as the Congo fan palm, is a species of large palm native to Central Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in swampy or wetland areas. Its leaves are used for thatching and roofing in local communities. The fruit produces a hard, inedible seed, and the plant plays a role in the ecological balance of its habitat."
