    "intro": "Roegneria grandis, commonly known as the tall bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, bluish-green leaves that are often folded in a V-shape. The plant produces spikelets that are arranged in dense, cylindrical clusters, with each spikelet containing two to three small, awned florets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and meadows. Roegneria grandis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological restoration projects."
