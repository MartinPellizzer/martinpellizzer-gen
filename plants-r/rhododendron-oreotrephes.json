    "intro": "Rhododendron oreotrephes, commonly known as the Sierra Madre rhododendron, is a species native to the western United States, particularly California and Nevada. It is a shrub that typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as rocky slopes and woodland edges. The plant produces showy, pink to red flowers in the spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The species is valued for its ornamental qualities and plays a role in the ecological diversity of its native region."
