    "intro": "Roella reticulata var. ternifolia, commonly known as the three-leaf roella, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets arranged symmetrically. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the rainy season. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is more commonly found in the wild."
