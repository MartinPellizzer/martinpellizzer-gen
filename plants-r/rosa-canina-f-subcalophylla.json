It is characterized by its smaller, more rounded leaves compared to the typical form of Rosa canina. The plant produces pale pink to white flowers that bloom in spring. Its fruits, known as hips, are orange-red and contain a high concentration of vitamin C. This subspecies is often found in woodland edges and scrub habitats across Europe."
