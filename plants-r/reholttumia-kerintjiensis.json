    "intro": "Reholttumia kerintjiensis, commonly known as the Kerintjiensis orchid, is a rare and endemic flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its intricate, showy floral structure with brightly colored petals and a distinctive lip. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil to flourish. Its blooming period typically occurs during the late spring and early summer months. Due to its limited habitat and susceptibility to environmental changes, Reholttumia kerintjiensis is considered a conservation concern."
