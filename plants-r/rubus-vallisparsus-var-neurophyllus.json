    "intro": "Rubus vallisparsus var. neurophyllus, commonly known as the coastal blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to coastal regions of North America. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and thorny stems, which help it anchor to sandy or rocky soils. The leaves are typically trifoliate, with a distinctive shape and a slightly hairy surface. Its flowers are small and white, producing aggregate fruits that are dark purple to black when mature. This plant thrives in saline and well-drained soils, often found in dune environments and coastal bluffs."
