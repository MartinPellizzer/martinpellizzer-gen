    "intro": "Rhamnus cuneifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It typically grows to a height of 6 to 15 feet and has dark green, elliptical leaves that turn reddish in the fall. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by dark blue berries that are toxic to humans and livestock. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and stream banks. Rhamnus cuneifolia is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological benefits, providing food and habitat for wildlife."
