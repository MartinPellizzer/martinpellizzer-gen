    "intro": "Rubus viridis, commonly known as green bramble, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its thorny stems and trifoliate leaves, which are typically serrated and have a glossy green appearance. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible berries that are usually red or black when ripe. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in a variety of habitats, including woodlands and hedgerows. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in certain regions."
