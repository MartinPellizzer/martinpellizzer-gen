    "intro": "Racosperma horridulum, commonly known as the woolly acacia, is a shrub native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its dense, grey-green foliage and long, straight stems covered in a thick layer of fine, woolly hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in cylindrical spikes, which bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are bipinnate, consisting of numerous small, oval-shaped leaflets. Racosperma horridulum is well adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky soils and coastal regions."
