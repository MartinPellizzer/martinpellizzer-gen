    "intro": "Rosa glaucamphibola, commonly known as the Alpine rose, is a species of shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or white. The plant produces elliptical, leathery leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. Rosa glaucamphibola is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and beauty. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, thriving in cooler climates."
