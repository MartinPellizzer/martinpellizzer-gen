    "intro": "Restiaria magniflora, commonly known as the golden flame orchid, is a striking tropical plant native to the humid lowland forests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant orange and yellow flowers, which bloom in clusters during the rainy season. The plant has strap-like, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its native environment. It thrives in partial shade and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
