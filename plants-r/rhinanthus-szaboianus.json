    "intro": "Rhinanthus szaboianus, commonly known as the Hungarian or European yellow toadflax, is a flowering plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its flowers are bright yellow, with two lips, and bloom from June to August. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and is considered a rare and protected species in some regions."
