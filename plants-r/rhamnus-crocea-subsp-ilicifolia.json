    "intro": "Rhamnus crocea subsp. ilicifolia, commonly known as the yellow buckthorn, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its small, yellowish-green leaves that are usually gland-dotted. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in the spring, followed by dark blue, berry-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or dry habitats. The subspecies is distinguished by its more shrub-like growth form compared to the typical tree form of Rhamnus crocea."
