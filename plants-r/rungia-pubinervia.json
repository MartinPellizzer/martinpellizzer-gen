    "intro": "Rungia pubinervia, commonly known as the velvetleaf or broadleaf rungia, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, velvety leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by small, red berries. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. Rungia pubinervia thrives in moist, shady environments and is commonly found in rainforests and wetlands."
