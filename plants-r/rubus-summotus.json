    "intro": "Rubus summotus, commonly known as the alpine raspberry, is a species of bramble native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and the presence of thorny stems, typical of many Rubus species. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or yellow in color, which are edible but often tart in flavor. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it thrives in cool, moist environments at high altitudes. Due to its habitat, it is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife."
