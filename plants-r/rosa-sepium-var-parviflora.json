    "intro": "Rosa sepium var. parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered dogwood rose, is a shrub-like plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with dense foliage and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces red or orange hips, which are edible and often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and floral arrangements."
