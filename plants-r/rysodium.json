    "intro": "Rysodium, commonly known as the saltbush, is a hardy shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions. It belongs to the genus *Atriplex* in the family Amaranthaceae. The plant is characterized by its succulent leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in saline and drought-prone environments. Its small, green or yellowish flowers are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Rysodium plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soils and providing forage for livestock in harsh climates."
