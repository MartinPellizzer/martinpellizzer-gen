It features a dense, woolly covering of white to pale gray hairs, giving it a distinctive, almost silvery appearance. The plant produces pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, adding a striking contrast to its fuzzy foliage. It is well-suited for rock gardens and containers due to its compact size and drought tolerance. Its unique appearance and easy care make it a popular choice among cactus enthusiasts."
