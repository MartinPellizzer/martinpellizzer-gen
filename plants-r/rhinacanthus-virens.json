    "intro": "Rhinacanthus virens, commonly known as the red sanders, is a small evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and glossy, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. Its fruit is a capsule that contains several winged seeds, aiding in wind dispersal. Due to its ornamental value and slow growth, it is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
