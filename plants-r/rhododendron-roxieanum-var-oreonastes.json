    "intro": "Rhododendron roxieanum var. oreonastes, commonly known as the Sierra Madre rhododendron, is a rare and endemic species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its compact shrub form, with dense, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to red, blooming in late spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments, often found in mountainous regions with acidic soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
