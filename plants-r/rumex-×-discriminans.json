    "intro": "Rumex \u00d7 discriminans, commonly known as the hybrid sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant that exhibits characteristics of both its parent species, Rumex acetosa and Rumex acetobulus. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with alternate, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers in spring, which are followed by reddish-brown, triangular fruits. It thrives in moist, fertile soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Due to its hybrid nature, it is not typically cultivated for ornamental or culinary purposes."
