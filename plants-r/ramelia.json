    "intro": "Ramelia, commonly known as the silverleaf nightshade, is a genus of flowering plants in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is native to various regions of the Americas, particularly in the southwestern United States and Mexico. The plants are characterized by their silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine hairs, and their showy, often violet or blue flowers. Ramelia species typically grow as shrubs or small trees, with some species reaching heights of up to 10 feet. They are adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making them resilient to drought conditions."
