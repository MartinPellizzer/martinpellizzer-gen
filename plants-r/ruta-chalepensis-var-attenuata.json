    "intro": "Ruta chalepensis var. attenuata, commonly known as the slender rue, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features aromatic, pinnately compound leaves with serrated edges, and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or dry soils, often found in coastal areas and mountainous regions. Its medicinal properties have been historically used in traditional remedies, though it contains toxic compounds that require careful handling. The varietal form 'attenuata' is distinguished by its more elongated and slender leaf structure compared to the typical variety."
