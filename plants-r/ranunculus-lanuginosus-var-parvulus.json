It features basal leaves that are lobed and covered in soft, woolly hairs, giving it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Due to its delicate nature, it is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value."
