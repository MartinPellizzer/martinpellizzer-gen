    "intro": "Ranunculus paludosus var. chondrodes, commonly known as the bog buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland habitats in northern Europe and parts of Asia. It features delicate, yellow flowers with five petals and a hairy, rough stem that often grows in marshy or peaty soils. The plant has palmately divided leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, aiding in water retention. It thrives in moist, acidic conditions and is often found in fens and bogs. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
