    "intro": "Rosa canivestis, commonly known as the sweetbriar rose, is a shrub native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of fragrant, pink or white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, red, berry-like fruits called hips, which are rich in vitamin C. Its leaves are alternate, pinnately compound, and covered in fine hairs. Rosa canivestis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and historical use in hedgerows and gardens."
