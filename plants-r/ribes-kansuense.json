    "intro": "Ribes kansuense, commonly known as the Kansu gooseberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of western China. It belongs to the genus Ribes in the family Grossulariaceae, which includes other species of gooseberries and currants. The plant is characterized by its small, five-lobed leaves and clusters of yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring. Its berries are typically red or orange when mature and are edible, though they are not as widely cultivated as other Ribes species. The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and has some traditional uses in local herbal medicine."
