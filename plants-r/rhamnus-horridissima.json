    "intro": "Rhamnus horridissima, commonly known as the roughleaf buckthorn, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, dark green leaves that are covered in fine, stiff hairs, giving it a rough texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by black, berry-like fruits that are an important food source for wildlife. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along stream banks. The species is also notable for its ability to tolerate drought and poor soil conditions."
