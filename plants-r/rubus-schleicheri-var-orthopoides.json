    "intro": "Rubus schleicheri var. orthopoides, commonly known as the upright blackberry shrub, is a variant of the Rubus genus native to parts of East Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit, distinguishing it from the more sprawling forms of its relatives. The plant produces small, dark berries that are typically edible, though they may vary in flavor and texture. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it has thorny stems typical of many Rubus species. This variety is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories."
