    "intro": "[WRONG START] Rubus \u00d7 malacopolitan, commonly known as the blackberry raspberry. It is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Rubus ursinus (the blackberry) and Rubus chamaemorus (the cloudberry). This species is characterized by its thorny stems and aggregate fruits that typically range in color from yellow to red. The plant thrives in temperate climates and is often found in wetlands and coastal areas. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a genetic resource for breeding programs aimed at improving fruit quality and disease resistance."
