    "intro": "Rosa canina var. tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly dog rose, is a shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, silvery-white pubescence that covers its stems and leaves, giving it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The flowers are typically pink or red, with five petals, and they appear in clusters during the spring. The plant produces edible hips, which are rich in vitamin C and used in culinary and medicinal applications. It is often found in woodland edges, hedgerows, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates."
