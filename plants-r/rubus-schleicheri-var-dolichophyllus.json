    "intro": "Rubus schleicheri var. dolichophyllus, commonly known as the long-leaf blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elongated, slender leaves and thorny stems typical of the Rubus genus. The plant produces small, dark berries that are edible but often have a tart flavor. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its native range."
