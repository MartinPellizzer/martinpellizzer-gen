    "intro": "Rhododendron laureola, commonly known as the dwarf laurel, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and clusters of bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of less than 1 meter, making it a compact and ornamental choice for gardens. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, often found in forest understories. Its flowers, which range in color from white to pink, bloom in late spring and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
