    "intro": "Rotala leptopetala, commonly known as the small-leaved waterwheel plant, is a species of aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of small, oval leaves that float on the water surface. The plant produces tiny, white flowers that are typically borne in clusters near the water's surface. It thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments and is often found in ponds and marshes. Rotala leptopetala is valued in aquascaping for its aesthetic appeal and ability to provide habitat for aquatic life."
