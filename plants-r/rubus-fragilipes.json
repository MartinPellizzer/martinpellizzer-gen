    "intro": "Rubus fragilipes, commonly known as the brittleleaf blackberry, is a species of shrub in the Rosaceae family. It is native to the high Andes of South America, specifically in regions of Peru and Bolivia. The plant is characterized by its slender, often sprawling growth habit and small, trifoliate leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are white to pale pink, and the fruit is a small, aggregate berry that ripens to a dark red or black color. Due to its delicate structure and limited distribution, Rubus fragilipes is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
