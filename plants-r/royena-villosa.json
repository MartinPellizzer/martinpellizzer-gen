    "intro": "Royena villosa, commonly known as the hairy royal fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, hairy fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its leaves are compound, with a feathery appearance, and it produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds. Royena villosa is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
