    "intro": "Robinia pseudoacacia var. amorphifolia, commonly known as the Amorphous false acacia, is a variant of the honey locust tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its unique, deeply lobed leaves that are often more irregular in shape compared to the typical form. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are followed by long, slender pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, often found in woodland edges and open areas. This variant is less common than the standard Robinia pseudoacacia and is valued for its ornamental foliage."
