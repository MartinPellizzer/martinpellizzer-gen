    "intro": "Randia oblanceolata, commonly known as the broadleaf randia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves with serrated margins. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer, followed by orange to red berries. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine, and the plant is valued for its ornamental appeal due to its vibrant foliage and showy flowers. Randia oblanceolata thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges."
