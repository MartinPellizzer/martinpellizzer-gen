    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus subsp. exiguifrons, commonly known as the narrow-fruited buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features delicate, bright yellow flowers with five to seven petals, often with a distinctive white or greenish central marking. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a hairy surface that helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. The subspecies is characterized by its smaller, more compact flower structure compared to the typical form of Ranunculus auricomus."
