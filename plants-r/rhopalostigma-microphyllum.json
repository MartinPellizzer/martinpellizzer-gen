    "intro": "Rhopalostigma microphyllum, commonly known as the small-leaved rhopalostigma, is a species of flowering plant in the family Geraniaceae. It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it grows in rocky and sandy soils. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit, small, oval-shaped leaves, and clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers. It is often found in coastal and mountainous regions, thriving in well-drained, sunny environments. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is more commonly encountered in the wild."
