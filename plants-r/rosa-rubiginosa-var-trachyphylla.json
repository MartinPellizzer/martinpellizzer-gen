    "intro": "Rosa rubiginosa var. trachyphylla, commonly known as the rough-stemmed dog rose, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features thorny stems covered in a rough, glandular texture, which gives it its botanical name. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are compound, with five to seven elliptical leaflets that are hairy beneath. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in hedgerows and as a source of rose hips."
