    "intro": "Rhynchospora nervosa var. cinnamomea, commonly known as cinnamon-leaved panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a distinctive cinnamon-colored sheath. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, three-lobed flowers. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. This variety is notable for its ornamental value and ecological importance in supporting wetland biodiversity."
