It is a shrub with upright, thorny stems and dark green, serrated leaves. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, pink to white flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it well-suited for rocky or mountainous environments. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and used in horticultural landscapes."
