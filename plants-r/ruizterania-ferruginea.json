    "intro": "Ruizterania ferruginea, commonly known as the rusty leaf orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to South America. It is characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped leaves and produces striking, yellowish-orange flowers with reddish-brown markings. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories. Ruizterania ferruginea has a complex root system that helps it absorb nutrients from the soil. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
