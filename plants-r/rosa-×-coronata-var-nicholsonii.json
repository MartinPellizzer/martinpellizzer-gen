    "intro": "Rosa \u00d7 coronata var. nicholsonii, commonly known as the Nicholson's hybrid rose, is a botanical hybrid resulting from the cross between Rosa rugosa and Rosa \u00d7 centifolia. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and large, fragrant, pink to red flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is native to the British Isles and thrives in coastal environments due to its tolerance for salt and wind. It has been cultivated for its ornamental value and is often used in gardens for its hardiness and showy blooms. The variety is noted for its vigorous growth and ability to produce multiple flower clusters along its stems."
