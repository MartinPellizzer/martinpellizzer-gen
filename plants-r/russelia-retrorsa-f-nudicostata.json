    "intro": "Russelia retrorsa f. nudicostata, commonly known as the naked-costate russelia, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage with elliptical leaves that are often adorned with reddish or purplish veins. The plant produces clusters of tubular, fragrant flowers in shades of pink to red, typically blooming in spring and summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees."
