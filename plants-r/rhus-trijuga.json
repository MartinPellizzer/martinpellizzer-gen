It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically three to five lobes, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by red, fuzzy berries that persist into winter. Rhus trijuga thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in open woods, fields, and along roadsides.
