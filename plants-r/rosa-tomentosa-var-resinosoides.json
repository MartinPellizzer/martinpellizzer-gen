    "intro": "Rosa tomentosa var. resinosoides, commonly known as the resinous moss rose, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and clusters of fragrant, pink to white flowers. Native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America, this plant thrives in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are covered in a fine, resinous coating, which helps to retain moisture and protect against pests. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in well-drained soil with partial shade."
