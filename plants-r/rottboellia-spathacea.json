    "intro": "Rottboellia spathacea, commonly known as the false rice or swamp grass, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often coated with fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in wetland environments and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along riverbanks. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes, it can become invasive in certain areas."
