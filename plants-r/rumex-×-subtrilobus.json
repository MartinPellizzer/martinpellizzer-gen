It is characterized by its distinctive trifoliate leaves, which are deeply lobed and often have a reddish or purple tint on the underside. The plant typically grows in moist, temperate environments such as wet meadows and riverbanks. It produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, which are followed by elongated, spiky fruits. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine for its potential health benefits."
