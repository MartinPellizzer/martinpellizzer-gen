It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of blue, violet, or white, which bloom from late winter to early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Ruellia brandbergensis is often found in rocky outcrops and is a component of the local flora in its native range."
