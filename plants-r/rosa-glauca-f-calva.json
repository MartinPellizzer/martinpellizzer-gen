    "intro": "Rosa glauca f. calva, commonly known as the pale pink shrub rose, is a unique cultivar of the Rosa glauca species. It is characterized by its pale pink to white flowers, which bloom in clusters and are often more subdued in color compared to the typical pink of the species. The plant is a deciduous shrub with thorny stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish bloom. It is native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe and prefers well-drained soils in full sun. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in gardens for its delicate floral display."
