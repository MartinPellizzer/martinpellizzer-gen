    "intro": "Rhus typhina var. viridiflora, commonly known as green-flowered staghorn sumac, is a variant of the staghorn sumac species native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown stems and oval, alternate leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in panicles, which are clustered in upright, branched inflorescences. These flowers give way to red, fuzzy berries that are a common food source for birds and wildlife. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in open woodlands, fields, and disturbed areas."
