    "intro": "Ranunculus repens var. vulgaris, commonly known as the creeping buttercup, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features bright yellow flowers with five to nine petals, often accompanied by two to three sepals that resemble petals. The plant has a sprawling growth habit, with rhizomatous stems that allow it to spread across moist, disturbed soils. Its leaves are palmately divided, typically with three to five lobes, and are covered in fine hairs. It thrives in wet or damp environments, such as marshes, stream banks, and roadside ditches."
