    "intro": "Rosa viscaria, commonly known as the sticky rose, is a shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and its ability to produce a sticky substance on its leaves and stems, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in rocky or dry habitats and is well adapted to arid conditions. Its flowers are usually pink to red in color, with five petals, and appear in clusters. Rosa viscaria is valued in horticulture for its ornamental qualities and hardy nature."
