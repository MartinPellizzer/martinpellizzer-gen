    "intro": "Romulea rosea var. pudica, commonly known as the shy bellflower, is a striking bulbous perennial native to southern Africa. It features showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a purple or red throat. The plant produces a dense cluster of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a rosette near the ground. It blooms in late spring to early summer, and its flowers close at night or on cloudy days, giving it its \"shy\" characteristic. This species thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes."
