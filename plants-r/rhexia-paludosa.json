    "intro": "Rhexia paludosa, commonly known as marsh rhexia, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in the eastern United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, acidic soils, often found in bogs and swampy areas. The plant produces clusters of small, showy pink or white flowers during the summer months. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and lance-shaped, with a smooth margin. Rhexia paludosa plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing wetland soils."
