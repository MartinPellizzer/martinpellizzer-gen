    "intro": "Rubus podophyllos subsp. longithyrsus, commonly known as the long-stalked blackberry, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers in the spring, which are followed by edible, dark purple berries in the summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and along streambanks. The subspecies is distinguished by its elongated pedicels, which give it its common name."
