    "intro": "Ranunculus polyanthemos var. robustus, commonly known as the robust buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a basal rosette of finely divided, lobed leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces showy, bright yellow flowers with five to seven petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, moist soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain environments."
