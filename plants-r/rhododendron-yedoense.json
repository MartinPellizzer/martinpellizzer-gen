    "intro": "Rhododendron yedoense, commonly known as the Japanese rhododendron, is a species native to Japan and parts of eastern Asia. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring broad, leathery leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its floral structure is characteristic of the Ericaceae family, with five petals fused at the base and a prominent calyx. Rhododendron yedoense is adapted to acidic, well-drained soils and thrives in partial to full shade, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens."
