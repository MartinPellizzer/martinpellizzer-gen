It is native to Madagascar and is characterized by its elongated body and distinctive coloration, often featuring a combination of green and brown hues. The plant it feeds on is typically a species of native vegetation, though its specific host plants are not well-documented. Its feeding habits can cause minor damage to leaves, but it is not considered a major agricultural pest. This species plays a role in the ecological balance of its native habitat."
