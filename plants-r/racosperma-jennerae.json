    "intro": "Racosperma jennerae, commonly known as the pink-flowered acacia, is a shrub native to Australia. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its pod fruits and nitrogen-fixing abilities. The plant is distinguished by its clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in spring. Its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into multiple pairs of small leaflets. Racosperma jennerae is often found in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments."
