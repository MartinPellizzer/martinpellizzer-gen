It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and trifoliate leaves that are often heart-shaped, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or orange in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Botanically, it is notable for its hederaceous (buckthorn-like) leaves and its role in local ecosystems as a food source for various wildlife species."
