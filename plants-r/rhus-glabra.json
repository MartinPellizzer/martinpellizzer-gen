    "intro": "Rhus glabra, commonly known as smooth sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and turn bright red in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by red, fuzzy berries that are a food source for birds and wildlife. Smooth sumac thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in disturbed soils along roadsides or in open woods. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it an important plant in ecological restoration projects."
