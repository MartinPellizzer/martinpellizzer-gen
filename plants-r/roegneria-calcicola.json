    "intro": "Roegneria calcicola, commonly known as the calcicola grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense mats. The plant thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures. Its narrow leaves are typically gray-green in color, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Roegneria calcicola plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for grazing animals in its native habitat."
