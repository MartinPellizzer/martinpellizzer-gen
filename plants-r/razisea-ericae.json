    "intro": "Razisea ericae, commonly known as the purple heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its ability to thrive in sandy, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, blooming in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, providing a drought-resistant feature. Razisea ericae is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
