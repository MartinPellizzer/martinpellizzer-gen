    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus subsp. calvescens, commonly known as the golden buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It features showy, bright yellow flowers with 5\u201315 petal-like sepals that are often reflexed, giving it a delicate, cup-like appearance. The plant typically grows in moist meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three deeply lobed leaflets, and it produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly smaller flowers and more compact growth compared to the typical form of R. auricomus."
