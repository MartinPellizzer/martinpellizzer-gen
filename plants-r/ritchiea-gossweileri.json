It is native to the coastal regions of southern Africa, particularly in South Africa and Namibia. This plant is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and a crown of large, pinnate leaves that are typically a deep green color. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires a warm, dry climate. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ritchiea gossweileri is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts to protect it."
