    "intro": "Ranunculus tripartitus var. submersus, commonly known as the submerged water crowfoot, is a aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to the northern regions of the United States and Canada. It typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds, lakes, and streams. The plant has finely divided, floating leaves that are often submerged, with roots that anchor it to the bottom of water bodies. Its flowers are small, yellow, and borne on slender stems, often appearing in clusters. This variant is adapted to waterlogged conditions, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
