It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, fragrant pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces oval, glossy leaves with a hairy texture, which gives it its common name. Rosa hispidula is typically found in dry, rocky soils and is well adapted to arid environments. It is a perennial plant that thrives in full sun and requires minimal water once established."
