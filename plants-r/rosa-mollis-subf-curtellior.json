It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and hairy, often glandular leaves. The flowers are typically pink to red in color, with five petals and numerous stamens, typical of the Rosaceae family. It produces small, oval berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. This sub-species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in harsh, alpine conditions."
