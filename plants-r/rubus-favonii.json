    "intro": "Rubus favonii, commonly known as the pink raspberry, is a species of bramble native to eastern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and produces small, pinkish-red berries that are typically harvested in late summer. The plant features compound leaves with three to five leaflets and thorny stems typical of the Rubus genus. Its flowers are white with five petals and are often visited by pollinators such as bees. The fruit is edible but has a tart flavor, making it a minor commercial crop in some regions."
