    "intro": "Rubus compos, commonly known as the blackberry shrub, is a member of the Rosaceae family and is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its thorny stems, trifoliate leaves, and aggregate fruits that develop from multiple ovaries. The plant typically grows in woodland edges, thickets, and disturbed soils, preferring partial to full sunlight. Its flowers are usually white or pink, with five petals, and the fruit, when ripe, turns from green to dark purple or black. Rubus compos is valued for its edible berries and is often cultivated for both ornamental and culinary purposes."
