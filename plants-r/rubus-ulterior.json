    "intro": "Rubus ulterior, commonly known as the trailing blackberry, is a species of brambles native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and thorny stems, which help it spread across the ground. The plant produces small, dark purple berries that are typically edible but have a tart flavor. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three leaflets that are serrated along the edges. Rubus ulterior plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing food for wildlife and supporting biodiversity."
