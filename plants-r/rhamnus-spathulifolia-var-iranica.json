    "intro": "Rhamnus spathulifolia var. iranica, commonly known as the Iranian narrow-leaf buckthorn, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Iran. It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by black, berry-like fruits that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in rocky or semi-arid environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological role, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and natural landscapes."
