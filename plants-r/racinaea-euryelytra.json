    "intro": "Racinaea euryelytra, commonly known as the broad-winged racinaea, is a rare and delicate epiphytic plant native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup, typical of many bromeliads. The plant's foliage is often covered in fine, white trichomes, which help in water retention and protection from intense sunlight. Its flowers, which are usually small and inconspicuous, are borne on short, leaf-like bracts. Due to its specific habitat requirements, Racinaea euryelytra is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is considered a species of conservation concern."
