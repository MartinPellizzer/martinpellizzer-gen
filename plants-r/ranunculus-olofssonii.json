    "intro": "Ranunculus olofssonii, commonly known as the Olofsson's buttercup, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family, which includes many species of buttercups and related plants. The plant is characterized by its simple, palmate leaves and showy, yellow flowers with numerous stamens. It typically grows in alpine or subalpine habitats, preferring well-drained soils and cool climates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
