    "intro": "Rosa micrantha f. inermis, commonly known as the smooth-stemmed rose, is a shrub-like plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its slender, thornless stems and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant has simple, alternate leaves with serrated edges, and its foliage is often covered in a fine layer of down. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a hardy ornamental plant. Due to its delicate appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable species in horticulture."
