    "intro": "Rubus ulmifolius var. albiflorus, commonly known as the whiteflower blackberry, is a variant of the common blackberry shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its pale white to cream-colored flowers, which contrast with its dark green, serrated leaves. The plant produces small, dark purple berries that are typically smaller and less flavorful than those of the standard Rubus ulmifolius. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges and hedgerows. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing food for birds and pollinators."
