    "intro": "Rubus carlscronensis, commonly known as the Carlscron raspberry, is a species of bramble native to southern Scandinavia. It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits known as drupes, which are typically red when mature. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and open areas. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
