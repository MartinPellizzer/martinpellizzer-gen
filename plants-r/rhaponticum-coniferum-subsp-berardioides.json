It features tall, upright stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, adorned with large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white hairs. The plant produces showy yellow flowers in late spring, arranged in a panicle inflorescence. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in meadows and rocky slopes at high elevations. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and herbal practices."
