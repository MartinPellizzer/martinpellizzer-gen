    "intro": "Ranunculus cuneilobus, commonly known as the narrow-lobed buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a basal rosette of pinnately lobed, hairy leaves that are typically dark green with a fuzzy texture. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with five to nine sepals and numerous stamens, often appearing in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
