It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and produces small, edible berries that are typically red or black in color. The plant features trifoliate leaves with serrated edges and produces white or pinkish flowers in the spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
