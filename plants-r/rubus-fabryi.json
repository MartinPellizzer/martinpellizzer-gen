It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, dark red to black berries that are typically edible. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and full sun exposure. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and less commonly cultivated species."
