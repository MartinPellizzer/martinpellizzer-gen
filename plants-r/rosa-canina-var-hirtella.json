    "intro": "Rosa canina var. hirtella, commonly known as the hairy dog rose, is a variant of the dog rose species native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which distinguish it from the more commonly seen Rosa canina. The plant produces fragrant, pink or white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by orange-red hips in autumn. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters, with thorny stems and pinnate leaves. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and is also used in traditional herbal medicine."
