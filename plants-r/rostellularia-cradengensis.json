    "intro": "Rostellularia cradengensis, commonly known as the Cradens rock orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found primarily in the mountainous regions of South Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with dense clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom during the winter months. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the cool, humid conditions of its native habitat. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat destruction and limited natural propagation, it is considered vulnerable and requires careful protection."
