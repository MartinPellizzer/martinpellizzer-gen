    "intro": "Rosa canina subvar. orthacantha, commonly known as the prickly rose, is a subspecies of the dog rose native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces oval, red-orange hips that are rich in vitamin C and are often used in traditional medicine. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with serrated edges, and the plant is typically shrub-like in growth habit. It thrives in well-drained soil and is often found in hedgerows and woodland edges."
