    "intro": "Robinia racemosa, commonly known as the yellow poplar or catalpa, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its showy, racemose inflorescences of pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The leaves are ovate, with a serrated margin, and the tree produces long, bean-like pods containing seeds. It has a fibrous, light-colored wood that is resistant to decay, making it valuable for certain construction uses. The plant is also noted for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
