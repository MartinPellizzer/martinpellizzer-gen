The plant produces daisy-like flowers with yellow disk flowers surrounded by pale green to reddish-brown ray flowers. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and stream banks. Rudbeckia nudicaulis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
