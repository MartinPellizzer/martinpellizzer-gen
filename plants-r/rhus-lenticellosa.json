    "intro": "Rhus lenticellosa, commonly known as the smooth sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically pinnately arranged with 11 to 31 leaflets. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by red, fuzzy berries that are an important food source for wildlife. Its bark is smooth and light gray, and it has numerous lenticels, which are small pores that allow gas exchange. Rhus lenticellosa is often found in moist, open habitats such as woodlands and stream banks."
