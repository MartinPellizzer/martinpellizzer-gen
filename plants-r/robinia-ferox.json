    "intro": "Robinia ferox, commonly known as the horse chestnut, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are palmately arranged and have a distinctive grayish-green color. The tree produces large, showy white or pinkish flowers in spring, followed by spiny, capsule-like fruits that contain toxic seeds. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing a rugged appearance. Robinia ferox is often found in moist, well-drained soils and can tolerate partial shade to full sun."
