    "intro": "Rosa acrotoma, commonly known as the cliffbank rose, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is a shrub that typically grows in rocky and well-drained soils, often along cliff faces and slopes. The plant produces fragrant, pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets, and it has thorny stems typical of many rose species. Rosa acrotoma is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
