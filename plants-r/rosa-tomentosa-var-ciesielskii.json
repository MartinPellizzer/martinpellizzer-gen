    "intro": "Rosa tomentosa var. ciesielskii, commonly known as the Ciesielski's woolly rose, is a rare and ornamental species native to the Carpathian Mountains. It is characterized by its dense, white to pale pink flowers and a profuse covering of grayish-white hairs on its stems and leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or forested areas, preferring well-drained soil and partial shade. Its foliage is often described as woolly due to the thick layer of pubescence, which helps protect it from harsh environmental conditions. This variety is prized for its unique appearance and is often cultivated in specialized gardens."
