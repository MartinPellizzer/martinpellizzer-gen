    "intro": "Rhaponticoides razdorskyi, commonly known as the Siberian rhubarb, is a perennial herb native to the cold regions of Siberia and northern Asia. It features a thick, fleshy rhizome and erect, simple stems that bear alternate, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color. It is adapted to harsh climates and can thrive in well-drained, loamy soils. Due to its hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated for ornamental purposes or as a source of medicinal compounds."
