It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by dark blue berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in chaparral and coastal scrub habitats. Its botanical features make it an important component of local ecosystems and a subject of study in plant ecology."
