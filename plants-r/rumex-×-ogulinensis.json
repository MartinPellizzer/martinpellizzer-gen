    "intro": "Rumex \u00d7 ogulinensis, commonly known as the hybrid sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant that exhibits characteristics of its parent species, Rumex acetosa and Rumex acetobatus. It typically grows in moist, fertile soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies. The plant has alternate, heart-shaped leaves with a serrated margin and a reddish or purple coloration on the veins. Its flowers are small and clustered in loose inflorescences, producing achenes as its reproductive structures. Due to its hybrid origin, Rumex \u00d7 ogulinensis shows genetic variability and can be challenging to classify botanically."
