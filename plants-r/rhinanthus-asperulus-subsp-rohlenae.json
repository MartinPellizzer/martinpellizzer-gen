    "intro": "Rhinanthus asperulus subsp. rohlenae, commonly known as the Rohlen's yellow rocket, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from the roots of neighboring plants. It typically grows in disturbed soils and open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Its subspecies status highlights its distinct morphological and genetic characteristics compared to other rhinanthus species."
