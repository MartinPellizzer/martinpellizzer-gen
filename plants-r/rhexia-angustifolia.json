    "intro": "Rhexia angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf bluetail, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Geraniaceae family and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces showy, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a slightly hairy surface, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Rhexia angustifolia is often found in woodland edges and wetlands, where it contributes to the biodiversity of its habitat."
