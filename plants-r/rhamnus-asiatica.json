    "intro": "Rhamnus asiatica, commonly known as the Chinese buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It typically grows to a height of 2\u20135 meters and has dense, thorny branches. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by small, black berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a slightly serrated edge. Rhamnus asiatica is often found in woodland areas and thrives in well-drained soils."
