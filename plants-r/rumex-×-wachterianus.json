    "intro": "Rumex \u00d7 wachterianus, commonly known as the hybrid sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant that belongs to the Polygonaceae family. It is a natural hybrid between Rumex acetosa (common sorrel) and Rumex acetobatus (water sorrel), resulting in a plant with unique botanical characteristics. The leaves are typically heart-shaped with a reddish or purple underside, and the plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found near water bodies or in wetlands. Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits variability in morphology and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
