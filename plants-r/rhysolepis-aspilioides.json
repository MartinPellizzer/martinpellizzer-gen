    "intro": "Rhysolepis aspilioides, commonly known as the silverleaf daphne, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine silvery down, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in late spring, followed by reddish-brown fruits. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a versatile addition to gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its seasonal color changes and unique foliage texture."
