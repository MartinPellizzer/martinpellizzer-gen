    "intro": "Rubus maranzae, commonly known as the red raspberry shrub, is a species of bramble native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its trailing or upright growth habit, with thorny stems and compound leaves that are usually trifoliate. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits known as raspberries, which are typically red but can also be yellow or orange in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and agricultural settings."
