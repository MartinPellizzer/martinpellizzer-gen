    "intro": "Rubus micans var. sabranskyi, commonly known as the Sabransky blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically harvested in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a temperate climate with adequate sunlight. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and somewhat obscure species within the Rubus genus."
