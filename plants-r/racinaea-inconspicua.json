    "intro": "Racinaea inconspicua, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the humid tropical forests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its slender, arching fronds that resemble ghostly silhouettes against the forest floor. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in the understory of dense vegetation. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. Due to its elusive nature and limited distribution, Racinaea inconspicua is considered a cryptic and less-studied species in the botanical world."
