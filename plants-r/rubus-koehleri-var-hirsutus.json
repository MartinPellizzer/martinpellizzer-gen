It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in the spring, followed by red, hairy berries that are edible but often tart. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its hairy texture and robust growth make it a distinctive member of the Rubus genus."
