    "intro": "Reidia gomphocarpa, commonly known as the African mountain cedar, is a small evergreen tree native to southern Africa. It typically grows in mountainous regions and is characterized by its dense, dark-green foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant produces small, fleshy fruits that are dispersed by animals, contributing to its ecological role in the region. It has a slow growth rate and is relatively drought-tolerant, making it well adapted to its arid or semi-arid environment. The tree is also valued for its durable wood, which has been used traditionally in construction and crafting."
