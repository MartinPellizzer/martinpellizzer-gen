    "intro": "Rhodanthe corymbiflora, commonly known as the coastal roushead, is a flowering plant native to the south-western coast of Western Australia. It is a shrub that typically grows in coastal heath and sandplain habitats, thriving in well-drained soils. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom from late winter to early spring. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in its arid environment. Rhodanthe corymbiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens in suitable climates."
