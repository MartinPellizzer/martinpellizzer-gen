    "intro": "Rhynchosia puberula, commonly known as the hairy cowpea, is a tropical legume native to Africa and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy stems and trifoliate leaves with small, heart-shaped leaflets. The plant produces yellow flowers that give way to elongated, cylindrical pods containing several seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its edible beans. Rhynchosia puberula is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it useful in agricultural systems."
