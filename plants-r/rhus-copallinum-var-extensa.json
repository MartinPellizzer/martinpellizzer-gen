It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and turn vibrant red in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by clusters of red, fuzzy berries that are a food source for birds. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is adaptable to various soil types. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping and erosion control."
