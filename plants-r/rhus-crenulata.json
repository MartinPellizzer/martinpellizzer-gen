    "intro": "Rhus crenulata, commonly known as the smooth sumac, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and have a serrated edge. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in cone-like clusters, followed by red, fuzzy fruits that attract birds and other wildlife. Rhus crenulata thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in disturbed soils along roadsides and in open woods. Its botanical features make it an important component of the ecosystem and a popular plant for ornamental use."
