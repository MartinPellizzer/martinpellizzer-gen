    "intro": "Rhodax origanifolius var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy oregano rhodax, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features aromatic, lance-shaped leaves covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are often used in culinary applications for their distinctive flavor, similar to oregano. The hairy texture of the foliage is a key botanical characteristic that aids in identifying this variety."
