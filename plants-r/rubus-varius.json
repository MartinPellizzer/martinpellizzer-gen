    "intro": "Rubus varius, commonly known as the variable blackberry, is a species of bramble native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and thorny stems, which support its classification within the Rubus genus. The plant produces aggregate fruits, known as berries, that are typically dark purple to black in color. Its leaves are compound, with three to five leaflets, and are often hairy beneath. Rubus varius thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
