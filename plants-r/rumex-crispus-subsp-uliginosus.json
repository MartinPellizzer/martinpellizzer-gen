It is characterized by its distinctive, wavy, and often reddish leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in acidic, moist soils and is often found in bogs, marshes, and other wetland environments. Due to its preference for wet conditions, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting diverse wetland ecosystems."
