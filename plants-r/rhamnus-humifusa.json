    "intro": "Rhamnus humifusa, commonly known as the creeping buckthorn, is a low-growing shrub native to the eastern United States. It typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are clustered in small, greenish-yellow inflorescences, and it produces dark blue berries that are edible for some wildlife. The plant's woody stems and persistent foliage make it a characteristic component of understory vegetation in its native habitat."
