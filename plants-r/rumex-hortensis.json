    "intro": "Rumex hortensis, commonly known as garden sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves that are tender and slightly sour due to the presence of oxalic acid. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and is often grown as a leafy vegetable or ornamental plant. Its botanical characteristics make it a valued species in both culinary and horticultural contexts."
