    "intro": "Rosa pendulina var. pseudopyrenaica, commonly known as the hanging rose or alpine rose, is a rare and delicate species native to the Pyrenees region. It is characterized by its slender, arching stems and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soil and full sun. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with finely toothed margins, and its pink to red flowers are often adorned with a white or pale pink center. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat."
