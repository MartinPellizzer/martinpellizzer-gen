    "intro": "Rotheca myricoides subsp. mafiensis, commonly known as the Mafi rockheath, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of New Zealand. It is characterized by its small, ovate leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its flowers are often borne on short, erect pedicels, and the plant is adapted to grow in rocky, coastal environments. Rotheca myricoides subsp. mafiensis is an important component of the local vegetation, contributing to the biodiversity of its habitat."
