    "intro": "Rhus ovata, commonly known as the smooth sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern and central United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically arranged in pairs along the stems, and its clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in the spring. The plant produces red, fuzzy berries that are a food source for birds and wildlife. Rhus ovata is often found in dry, open habitats such as woodlands, fields, and stream banks. Its botanical features make it an important component of native plant communities and a popular choice for ecological restoration projects."
