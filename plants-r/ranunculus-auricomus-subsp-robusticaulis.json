    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus subsp. robusticaulis, commonly known as the broad-leaved buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features showy, yellow flowers with five broadly ovate petals and numerous stamens. The plant has alternate, trifoliate or pinnately compound leaves that are often hairy. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and stream banks. The subspecies is distinguished by its robust, upright growth habit and larger, more robust leaves compared to the typical form."
