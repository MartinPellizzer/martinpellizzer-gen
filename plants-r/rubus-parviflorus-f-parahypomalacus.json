    "intro": "Rubus parviflorus f. parahypomalacus, commonly known as the small-flowered raspberry. This plant is a horticultural form of the common raspberry, characterized by its smaller, more delicate flowers compared to the typical species. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is known for its thorny stems and aggregate fruits. The leaves are typically trifoliate, with serrated margins, and the plant thrives in temperate climates. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and edible fruits, though its yield is generally lower than that of the standard Rubus parviflorus."
