It is characterized by its striking spiral arrangement of leaves, which gives it its common name. The plant produces showy yellow flowers with five petals, often with a dark central spot. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and wetlands. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and ecological restoration projects."
