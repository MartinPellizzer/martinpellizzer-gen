    "intro": "Rhinanthus alectorolophus var. bornmuelleri, commonly known as the yellow rattle, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant that belongs to the Orobanchaceae family. It is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers and is often found in grassland habitats across Europe. The plant has a slender, erect stem with opposite, lance-shaped leaves. Its roots form a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption. This variant is notable for its ecological role in promoting plant diversity by reducing the dominance of grasses in certain ecosystems."
