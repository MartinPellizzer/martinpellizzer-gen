    "intro": "Rosa multiflora var. carnea, commonly known as the pink flowering shrub, is a deciduous shrub native to East Asia. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, pink to red flowers in late spring to early summer. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and as a hedge due to its rapid growth. However, it can become invasive in some regions if not properly managed."
