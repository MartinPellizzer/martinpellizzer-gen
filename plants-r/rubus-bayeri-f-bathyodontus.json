    "intro": "Rubus bayeri f. bathyodontus, commonly known as the deep-toothed blackberry, is a botanical variant of the blackberry species within the Rubus genus. It is characterized by its distinctive, deeply lobed leaves and thorny stems, typical of many Rubus species. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black in color. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland areas or along the edges of forests. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for study in horticulture and plant taxonomy."
