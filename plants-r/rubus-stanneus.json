    "intro": "Rubus stanneus, commonly known as the leadplant raspberry, is a species of bramble native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible but often described as tart and less palatable compared to other Rubus species. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodland edges or along stream banks. Botanically, it is part of the Rosaceae family, which includes other familiar plants like roses and apples."
