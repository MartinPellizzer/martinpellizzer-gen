    "intro": "Rubus parviflorus subsp. velutinus, commonly known as the velvet raspberry, is a species of bramble native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its dense, velvety pubescence on the stems and leaves, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or black when mature. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. Its botanical features make it an important component of local ecosystems and a subject of interest in plant taxonomy."
