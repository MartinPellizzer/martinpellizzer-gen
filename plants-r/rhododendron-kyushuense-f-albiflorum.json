    "intro": "Rhododendron kyushuense f. albiflorum, commonly known as the white-flowered Kyushu rhododendron, is a rare and ornamental plant native to Japan. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its broad, leathery leaves and showy, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in acidic, well-drained soils and thrives in partial shade to full sun. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens and as a specimen plant in cultivated landscapes. The floral display is particularly striking in late spring, adding a unique aesthetic to its natural or garden environment."
