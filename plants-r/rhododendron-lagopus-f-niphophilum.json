    "intro": "Rhododendron lagopus f. niphophilum, commonly known as the snow-capped rhododendron, is a unique botanical variant characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and striking white to pale pink flowers. It is a hybrid form within the Rhododendron genus, typically found in high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, often growing in rocky or alpine habitats. Its foliage remains largely covered in a thick layer of white pubescence, giving it a distinctive appearance. This form is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in specialized gardens."
