    "intro": "Rapuntium tenellum, commonly known as the slender cress, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like mustard and cabbage. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in cultivated fields. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by rounded, hairy seed pods. The leaves are alternate, pinnately divided, and have a slightly peppery taste, making it a minor wild edible in some regions."
