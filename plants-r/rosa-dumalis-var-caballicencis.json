    "intro": "Rosa dumalis var. caballicencis, commonly known as the Caballicencis rose, is a rare and ancient variety of wild rose native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cooler, high-altitude environments. Its foliage consists of pinnately compound leaves with serrated edges, and it produces edible, tart berries that are used in traditional herbal remedies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
