    "intro": "Rostraria glabriflora, commonly known as the smooth-flowered rostraria, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, typical of the family. Rostraria glabriflora is known for its unique rostellum, a small, elongated structure at the base of the flower, which is a distinguishing feature. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
