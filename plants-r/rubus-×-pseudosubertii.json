    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 pseudosubertii, commonly known as the blackberry-elderberry hybrid, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves. The plant produces aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black in color, with a tart flavor. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and wetlands. Due to its hybrid origin, it exhibits a mix of traits from both blackberries and elderberries, making it a unique and sometimes invasive species in its native range."
