    "intro": "Ranunculus paludosus subsp. millefoliatus, commonly known as the water crowfoot, is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves that resemble a fern. It typically grows in wet or aquatic environments such as marshes, pond margins, and slow-moving streams. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom in early spring. Its root system is rhizomatous, allowing it to spread vegetatively and colonize moist habitats. It is a member of the Ranunculaceae family, known for its showy flowers and often toxic compounds."
