    "intro": "Rubus canterburiensis, commonly known as the Canterbury raspberry, is a species of bramble native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its prickly stems and aggregate fruits, which are typically red when ripe. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by the development of its edible berries. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forest margins and rocky areas. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native range."
