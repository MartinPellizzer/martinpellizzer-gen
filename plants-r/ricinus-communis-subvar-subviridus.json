It is native to tropical regions and thrives in warm, humid climates. The plant produces distinctive spiny capsules that contain toxic seeds, which are often used in traditional medicine. Its leaves are also used as ornamental foliage in gardens and landscapes. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain areas."
