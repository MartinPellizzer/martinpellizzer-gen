    "intro": "Rosa jyllandiae, commonly known as the Jylland rose, is a rare and endangered species native to the coastal regions of Denmark. It is a shrub-like plant with thorny stems and dark green, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring. Rosa jyllandiae thrives in sandy soils and is adapted to maritime climates with high salt exposure. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is critically endangered and protected in its native range."
