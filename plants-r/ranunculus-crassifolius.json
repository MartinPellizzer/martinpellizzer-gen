    "intro": "Ranunculus crassifolius, commonly known as the broad-leaved buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features basal leaves that are broad and heart-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces showy yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its hairy stems and lobed leaves are characteristic of the Ranunculaceae family."
