It belongs to the Anacardiaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like poison ivy and mango. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically arranged in pairs along the stems, and its clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in spring. Smooth sumac produces red, fuzzy berries that are a food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in open woods, thickets, and along roadsides."
