It features succulent, green stems that are often ribbed and covered with small, white or yellowish tubercles. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color, arranged in clusters at the leaf axils. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to lanceolate, and have a slightly waxy texture. This species is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a capacity for water storage in its stems to survive drought conditions."
