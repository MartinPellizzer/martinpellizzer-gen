    "intro": "Rabdosia grandifolia var. atuntzeensis, commonly known as the Atuntze mountain betony, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its square, hairy stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, two-lipped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value and medicinal properties make it a subject of interest in both horticulture and traditional medicine."
