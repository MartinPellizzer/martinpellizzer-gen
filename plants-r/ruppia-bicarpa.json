    "intro": "Ruppia bicarpa, commonly known as the common sea rice, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments. It is typically found in coastal areas, estuaries, and brackish water habitats. The plant has a submerged, ribbon-like stem with small, scale-like leaves. It produces tiny, greenish flowers that are pollinated by wind. Ruppia bicarpa plays a role in stabilizing sediments and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
