    "intro": "Rhexia semiserrata, commonly known as the Carolina rose or swamp rose, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Geraniaceae family and is characterized by its showy pink to red flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks, thriving in moist, acidic soils. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have finely serrated edges, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Rhexia semiserrata is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
