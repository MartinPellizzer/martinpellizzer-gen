    "intro": "Roegneria macrochaeta, commonly known as the hairy wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a hairy texture. The plant produces spikelets that bear small, two-lobed florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed areas. Roegneria macrochaeta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
