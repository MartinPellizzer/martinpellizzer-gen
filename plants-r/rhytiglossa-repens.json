    "intro": "Rhytiglossa repens, commonly known as the wandering liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its creeping growth habit and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rock crevices. The plant has a thalloid structure with a distinct central axis and is typically green or reddish in color. It reproduces through spores, which are released from small, leaf-like structures called gametophores. Rhytiglossa repens plays a role in soil stabilization and serves as a habitat for various microorganisms and small invertebrates."
