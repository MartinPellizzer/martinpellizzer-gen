It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its small, thorny stems and clusters of white flowers. The plant produces small, edible berries that are typically red when ripe. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodland edges and shaded areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
