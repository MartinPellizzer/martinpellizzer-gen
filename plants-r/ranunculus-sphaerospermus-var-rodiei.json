    "intro": "Ranunculus sphaerospermus var. rodiei, commonly known as the rock ranunculus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its basal rosette of deeply lobed, hairy leaves and its showy, yellow flowers with five petals. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. Its flowers bloom in spring and are pollinated by insects, contributing to its ecological role in local ecosystems. The variety is distinguished by its compact growth habit and unique floral structure compared to other ranunculus species."
