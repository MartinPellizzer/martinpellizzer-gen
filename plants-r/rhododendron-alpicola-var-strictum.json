    "intro": "Rhododendron alpicola var. strictum, commonly known as the Alpine rhododendron, is a compact evergreen shrub native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It features dense, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy, adapted to withstand cold and strong winds. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, pink to reddish flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is often cultivated in alpine gardens and conservation efforts."
