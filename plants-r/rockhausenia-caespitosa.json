    "intro": "Rockhausenia caespitosa, commonly known as the rock grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense clumps. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its small, spike-like inflorescences bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Rockhausenia caespitosa is valued for its resilience and is often used in landscaping for erosion control in dry regions."
