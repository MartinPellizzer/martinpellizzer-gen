    "intro": "Rorippa islandica var. occidentalis, commonly known as the western watercress, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of North America. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils near the shoreline, often in tidal zones. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are succulent and often submerged. This variety is distinguished by its slightly broader leaves and more robust growth compared to the typical R. islandica."
