    "intro": "Rapuntium pedunculatum, commonly known as the clustered cress, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other cruciferous plants. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by seed pods that split open to release tiny seeds. Its leaves are edible and have a peppery flavor, similar to that of mustard. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks."
