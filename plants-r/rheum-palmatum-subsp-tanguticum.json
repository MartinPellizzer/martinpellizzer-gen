    "intro": "Rheum palmatum subsp. tanguticum, commonly known as the Tangut rhubarb, is a perennial herb native to the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and adjacent regions of China. It is characterized by its large, dark green, arrowhead-shaped leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The plant produces tall, reddish stems with clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in the spring. Its rhizomes are often harvested for medicinal purposes due to their high content of alkaloids and other bioactive compounds. This subspecies is valued in traditional Chinese medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and detoxifying properties."
