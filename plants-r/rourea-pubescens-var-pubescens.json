    "intro": "Rourea pubescens var. pubescens, commonly known as the velvetleaf rourea, is a shrub native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its dense, velvety pubescence that covers its stems and leaves, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters and features opposite, ovate to elliptical leaves. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in panicle inflorescences, often blooming during the rainy season. The species is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories and along stream banks."
