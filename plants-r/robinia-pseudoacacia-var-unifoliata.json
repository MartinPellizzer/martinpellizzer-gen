    "intro": "Robinia pseudoacacia var. unifoliata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved false acacia, is a variant of the black locust tree characterized by its slender, elongated leaves. It is native to the eastern United States and thrives in well-drained soils, preferring full sun exposure. The plant produces fragrant, yellow pea-like flowers in summer, which are followed by elongated, woody pods containing flat, brown seeds. Its leaves are typically narrower and fewer in number compared to the typical black locust, giving it a distinct appearance. This variety is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
