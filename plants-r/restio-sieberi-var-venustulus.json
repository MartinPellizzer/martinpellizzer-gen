It belongs to the Restionaceae family, which includes many grass-like plants adapted to Mediterranean climates. The plant features wiry, grass-like stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. It produces small, clustered inflorescences with tiny white or pale blue flowers. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in coastal gardens due to its salt tolerance and drought resistance."
