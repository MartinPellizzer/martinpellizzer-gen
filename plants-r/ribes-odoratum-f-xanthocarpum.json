    "intro": "Ribes odoratum f. xanthocarpum, commonly known as the yellow-fruited gooseberry, is a cultivated form of the common gooseberry. It is characterized by its distinctive yellow berries, which contrast with the typical red or green fruits of the species. The plant is a deciduous shrub with upright, thornless stems and trifoliate leaves. It produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in early spring, followed by the showy yellow fruits in late summer. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often grown in gardens for its vibrant fruit color and hardy nature."
