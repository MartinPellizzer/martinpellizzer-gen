    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 licens, commonly known as the blackberry bramble, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Rubus ursinus (the blackberry) and Rubus fruticosus (the bramble). It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves, typical of the Rubus genus. The plant produces aggregate fruits composed of small, drupe-like berries that are typically dark purple to black in color. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils. Due to its hardy nature, it is both an important wild plant and a cultivated crop in various regions."
