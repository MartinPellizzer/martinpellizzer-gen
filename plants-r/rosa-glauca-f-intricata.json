    "intro": "Rosa glauca f. intricata, commonly known as the intricate blue rose, is a botanical variant of the Rosa glauca species. It is characterized by its striking, deep blue petals, which are a result of specific pigmentation and genetic traits. This form is typically smaller than the standard Rosa glauca, with a more compact growth habit. The plant produces fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth."
