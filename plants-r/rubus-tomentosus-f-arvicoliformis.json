It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and thorny stems, which provide protection against herbivores. The leaves are typically oval-shaped with a velvety texture, and the plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are usually dark red to black in color. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges or disturbed soils. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental qualities and resilience in various environmental conditions."
