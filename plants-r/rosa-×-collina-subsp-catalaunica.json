    "intro": "Rosa \u00d7 collina subsp. catalaunica, commonly known as the Catalaunica rock rose, is a hybrid species within the rose family, Rosaceae. It is a shrub-like plant characterized by its dense, thorny stems and small, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or white. The plant is native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans and parts of southern Europe, where it thrives in rocky and well-drained soils. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces hips, which are the fruiting bodies containing seeds. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in moderate climates."
