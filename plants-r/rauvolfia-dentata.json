    "intro": "Rauvolfia dentata, commonly known as Indian snakeroot, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Pacific. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its climbing habit, with hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by capsule fruits containing elliptical seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its medicinal properties, particularly the presence of reserpine, it has been historically used in traditional medicine."
