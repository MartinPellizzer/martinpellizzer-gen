    "intro": "Rosa communis var. pseudodumetorum, commonly known as the false bramble rose, is a shrub-like species characterized by its thorny stems and dense foliage. It typically grows in woodland edges and hedgerows, thriving in partial shade to full sun. The plant produces fragrant, pink to white flowers in late spring, which are followed by red, hairy hips in autumn. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have serrated edges, contributing to its ornamental value. This variety is valued for its hardiness and ability to attract pollinators."
