    "intro": "Ryparosa anterides, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic appeal. The plant has compound leaves with elongated, lance-shaped leaflets and produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in panicles. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds. Due to overharvesting, Ryparosa anterides is now classified as an endangered species."
