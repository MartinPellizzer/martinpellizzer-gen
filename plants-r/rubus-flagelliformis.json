    "intro": "Rubus flagelliformis, commonly known as the creeping raspberry, is a shrub native to parts of Asia and North America. It is characterized by its slender, trailing stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or black when mature. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three oval-shaped leaflets, and are covered in fine, soft hairs. Rubus flagelliformis is often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and stream banks."
