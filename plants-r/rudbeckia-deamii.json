    "intro": "Rudbeckia deamii, commonly known as the Deam's coneflower, is a perennial flowering plant native to the central United States. It features showy, daisy-like yellow-orange petals surrounding a dark brown central disk, which gives it its coneflower name. The plant typically grows to a height of 2 to 4 feet and produces its characteristic flowers from late summer into early autumn. Rudbeckia deamii has lance-shaped, dark green leaves and is often found in moist to wet habitats such as marshes and wet meadows. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing nectar for pollinators."
