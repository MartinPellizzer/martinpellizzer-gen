    "intro": "Roegneria semicostata, commonly known as the slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Asia and North America. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, which are wind-pollinated. Roegneria semicostata is often found in moist meadows, stream banks, and other wetland habitats. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
