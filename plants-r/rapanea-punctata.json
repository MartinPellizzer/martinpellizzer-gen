    "intro": "Rapanea punctata, commonly known as the spotted evergreen or red-leafed evergreen, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves with distinct red or purple veins, which give it a striking appearance. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers followed by red or orange berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant in tropical regions."
