    "intro": "Rosa obtusifolia f. arenosa, commonly known as the sand rose, is a compact, low-growing shrub native to arid and coastal regions of southern Europe. It features dense, silver-gray foliage that is covered in fine, woolly hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its roots are deep and drought-tolerant, allowing it to thrive in sandy or rocky soils. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to withstand coastal conditions."
