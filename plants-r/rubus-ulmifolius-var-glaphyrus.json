It is characterized by its thorny stems and trifoliate leaves, which are typically heart-shaped and have a distinctive dark green color. The plant produces aggregate fruits, known as berries, which are usually dark purple to black when mature. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in hedgerows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils. This variety is notable for its hardy nature and ability to spread through both vegetative growth and seed dispersal."
