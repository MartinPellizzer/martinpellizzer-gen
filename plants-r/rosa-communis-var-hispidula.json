    "intro": "Rosa communis var. hispidula, commonly known as the rough shrub rose, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and thorny stems, which provide structural support and serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces fragrant, pink to red flowers in late spring to early summer, which are typically borne on long, slender pedicels. Its leaves are compound, consisting of five to seven elliptical leaflets with a slightly serrated margin. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its beauty and hardiness."
