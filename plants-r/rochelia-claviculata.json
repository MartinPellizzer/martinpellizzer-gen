    "intro": "Rochelia claviculata, commonly known as the clustered rosette lichen, is a foliose lichen that forms dense, compact growths on rock surfaces. It is characterized by its bright green to yellowish-green thallus, which is often covered with a layer of fine, powdery granules. The lichen thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found on calcareous substrates. It plays an important role in soil formation and nutrient cycling in forest ecosystems. Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered an indicator species for ecological health."
