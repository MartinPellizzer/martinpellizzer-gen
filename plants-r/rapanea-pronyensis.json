    "intro": "Rapanea pronyensis, commonly known as the Pr\u00f3ny's holly, is a species of flowering plant in the family Lauraceae. It is native to Madagascar and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and small, aromatic leaves. The plant produces white or pale yellow flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its fruits are small drupes that contain a single seed, and the plant is adapted to grow in humid, tropical environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Rapanea pronyensis is considered a rare and endangered species."
