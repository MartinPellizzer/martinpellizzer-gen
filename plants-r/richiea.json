These plants are characterized by their unique, spiral-shaped inflorescences and their ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Richiea species typically have lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a silvery or whitish coating, giving them their common name. They are popular in horticulture for their ornamental value and ease of care. The genus is part of the family Araliaceae, which includes other familiar plants like peace lilies and ivy."
