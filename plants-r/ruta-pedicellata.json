    "intro": "Ruta pedicellata, commonly known as creeping rue, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, branching stems that grow close to the ground, often forming dense mats. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in loose inflorescences. Its leaves are pinnately divided, with a strong, aromatic scent reminiscent of rue. Ruta pedicellata is often used in traditional medicine and as a decorative plant in gardens."
