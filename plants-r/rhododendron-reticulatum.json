    "intro": "Rhododendron reticulatum, commonly known as the reticulate rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Asia, particularly in China and Nepal. It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and clusters of fragrant, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a compact growth habit with multiple stems, often forming thickets in its natural habitat. Its leaves are typically elliptical and have a leathery texture, while its flowers range in color from white to pink and purple. Rhododendron reticulatum is well adapted to cool, moist environments and thrives in acidic, well-drained soils."
