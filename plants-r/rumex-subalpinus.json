    "intro": "Rumex subalpinus, commonly known as alpine sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions. The plant features basal leaves that are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in spring. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats. Rumex subalpinus is valued for its edible leaves, which have a tangy, sour flavor."
