It is characterized by its delicate, yellow petals and a hairy, erect stem. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils. It produces small, green leaves with a distinctive lobed shape. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
