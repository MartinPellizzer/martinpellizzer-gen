    "intro": "Rubus thyrsoideus f. montigenus, commonly known as the mountain raspberry, is a variant of the thorned bramble characterized by its upright growth habit and dense, shrub-like form. It features compound leaves with serrated edges and produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or orange in color. The plant is native to high-altitude regions of the Andes and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, with five petals and numerous stamens. This form is distinguished by its more compact structure and slightly different leaf morphology compared to the typical Rubus thyrsoideus."
