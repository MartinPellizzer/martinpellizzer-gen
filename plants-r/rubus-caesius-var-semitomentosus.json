    "intro": "Rubus caesius var. semitomentosus, commonly known as the silky blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant characterized by its dense, silky white or gray pubescence on the stems and leaves. It is native to eastern North America and typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are often tart and less commonly consumed by humans compared to other blackberry varieties. Its foliage is usually trifoliate, with three leaflets that are oval to elliptic in shape. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
