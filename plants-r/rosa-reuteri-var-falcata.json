    "intro": "Rosa reuteri var. falcata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf rock rose, is a compact, shrub-like species native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, dark green, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of fragrant, pink to red flowers in late spring. The plant is adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun. It is often used in rock gardens or as a border plant due to its hardiness and ornamental value. Its botanical characteristics make it a popular choice for drought-tolerant landscaping."
