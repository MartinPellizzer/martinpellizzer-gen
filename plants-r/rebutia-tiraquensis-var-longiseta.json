    "intro": "Rebutia tiraquensis var. longiseta, commonly known as the Long-hair Rebutia, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact, rounded shape and dense covering of fine, hair-like spines, which give it its common name. The plant produces vibrant, showy flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are fleshy and typically arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to store water in its native environment. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and resilience in dry, well-drained soils."
