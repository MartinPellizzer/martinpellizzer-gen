    "intro": "Rumex acetosa var. haplorhizus, commonly known as narrow-leaved dock, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along riverbanks. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a distinctive reddish or purple coloration on the underside, and it produces small, greenish flowers in clusters. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats. The species is valued for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally for its astringent and anti-inflammatory effects."
