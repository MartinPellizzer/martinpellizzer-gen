It typically grows along riverbanks and wetlands, thriving in moist, well-drained soils. The plant features arching stems with dark green, ovate leaves that have serrated edges. Its flowers are pink to white, appearing in clusters, and are followed by red-orange hips that contain seeds. Rosa riparia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing riverbanks."
