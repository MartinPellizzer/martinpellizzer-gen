    "intro": "Rubus vulgaris var. tardiflorus, commonly known as the late-flowering bramble, is a variant of the common bramble. It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves. The flowers of this plant typically bloom later in the season compared to the standard Rubus vulgaris. It produces edible berries that are similar in taste to other raspberries but are often smaller. This variety is often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils across Europe."
