It typically grows in moist meadows, woodland edges, and along streams, preferring well-drained soils. The plant features showy yellow flowers with five to ten petals, which are usually surrounded by a ring of sepals. Its leaves are palmately lobed, and the plant produces small, greenish-yellow fruits that disperse via wind. It is often found in temperate regions and is considered a characteristic species of open, sunny habitats."
