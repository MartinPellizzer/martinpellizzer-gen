    "intro": "Rubus leucochlamys, commonly known as the white-flowered blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit, with thorny stems and compound leaves that are typically arranged alternately. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible berries that are similar in appearance to other Rubus species. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forested areas with well-drained soil. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and agricultural settings."
