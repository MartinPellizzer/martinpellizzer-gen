    "intro": "Rubus tagallus, commonly known as the New Zealand bramble, is a shrub native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in spring, followed by red or black berries in autumn. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions. Due to its invasive nature, it is often considered a weed in parts of its introduced range."
