    "intro": "Rosularia radicosa, commonly known as the root rose or radicosa rose, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit with fleshy, succulent stems. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, often blooming in late spring to early summer. Its roots are thick and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. Rosularia radicosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
