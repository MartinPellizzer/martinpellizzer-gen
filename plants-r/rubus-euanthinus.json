    "intro": "Rubus euanthinus, commonly known as the alpine blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and small, dark berries that ripen in late summer. The plant typically thrives in rocky or alpine habitats, where it forms dense mats or low shrubs. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the flowers are pale yellow with five petals. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
