    "intro": "Rhododendron pseudobuxifolium, commonly known as the dwarf rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia, particularly China. It is a shrub characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. The leaves are small, leathery, and often resemble those of boxwood, giving the plant its common name. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticultural landscapes for its compact growth habit and vibrant floral displays."
