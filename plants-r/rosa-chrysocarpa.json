    "intro": "Rosa chrysocarpa, commonly known as the golden fruit rose, is a deciduous shrub native to China. It is characterized by its dark green, serrated leaves and produces showy pink to red flowers in spring. The plant is notable for its edible, yellow-orange hips that mature in autumn, which are rich in vitamin C. Rosa chrysocarpa thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy addition to gardens. Its ornamental value is complemented by its historical use in traditional medicine."
