    "intro": "Rubus minutispinosus, commonly known as the dwarf spiny raspberry. It is a species of bramble native to the eastern United States, characterized by its small, thorny stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, red berries that are typically edible but not as commonly cultivated as other raspberry varieties. It thrives in moist, wooded areas and is often found in the understory of deciduous forests. Its botanical features make it a valuable species for ecological studies and local biodiversity."
