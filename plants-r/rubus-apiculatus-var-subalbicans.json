It is characterized by its slender, thorny stems and trifoliate leaves with a slightly hairy underside. The flowers are typically white or pale pink, and the berries are small, dark purple to black when ripe. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its fruit is often used in jams and pies, though it is less commonly cultivated than other blackberry varieties."
