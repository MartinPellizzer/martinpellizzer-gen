    "intro": "Rubus slatinensis, commonly known as the Slatina blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the Balkans. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically harvested in late summer. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and partial shade. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
