    "intro": "Rosa canina var. jurensis, commonly known as the Jurensis rose, is a variant of the dog rose native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows to a height of 1\u20132 meters, featuring thorny stems and compound leaves. The plant produces fragrant, pink to red flowers in the spring, which are followed by orange-red hips in the autumn. These hips are rich in vitamin C and have been used in traditional herbal remedies. The botanical characteristics of this variety make it a valuable species for both ornamental and ecological purposes."
