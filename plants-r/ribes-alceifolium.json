    "intro": "Ribes alceifolium, commonly known as alpine gooseberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine environments, often on rocky slopes and talus areas. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by edible berries that are yellow to orange in color. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a serrated margin, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. Ribes alceifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
