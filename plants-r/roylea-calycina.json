    "intro": "Roylea calycina, commonly known as the Kashmir rose or Himalayan rose, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is a shrub that typically grows in rocky and alpine environments, thriving at elevations between 2,000 and 4,000 meters. The plant produces showy, pink or white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are elliptical and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its cold, arid habitat. Roylea calycina is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique appearance."
