    "intro": "Ranunculus alpestris subsp. leroyi, commonly known as the alpine buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant features bright yellow flowers with five petal-like sepals, which are often mistaken for true petals. Its leaves are deeply divided and covered in fine hairs, adapting to the harsh mountain environment. This subspecies is notable for its ecological role in alpine ecosystems and its ornamental value in gardens."
