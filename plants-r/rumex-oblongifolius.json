    "intro": "Rumex oblongifolius, commonly known as the broad-leaved dock, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features upright, branched stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height, adorned with large, heart-shaped leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, which are typically arranged in a loose, terminal inflorescence. Its leaves are characterized by their broad, oblong shape and distinctive veins, while the roots are fibrous and often used in traditional medicine. Rumex oblongifolius thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is commonly found in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks."
