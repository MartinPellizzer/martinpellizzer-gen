    "intro": "Rubus tereticaulis f. subrhombeus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant characterized by its slender, elongated leaves. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows in woodland edges and disturbed soils across the eastern United States. The plant produces small, dark purple to black fruits that are generally less palatable than those of other blackberry species. Its flowers are white and clustered in dense inflorescences, contributing to its ornamental value. The plant is notable for its adaptability and is often found in moist, well-drained habitats."
