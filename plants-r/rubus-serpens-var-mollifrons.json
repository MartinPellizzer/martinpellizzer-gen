    "intro": "Rubus serpens var. mollifrons, commonly known as the soft-fruited blackberry shrub, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to parts of North America. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and thorny stems, which help it to climb and spread across the ground. The leaves are typically trifoliate, with three leaflets that are oval-shaped and have a slightly hairy texture. Its flowers are small and white, appearing in clusters, and the fruit is a dark purple to black berry that is edible. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
