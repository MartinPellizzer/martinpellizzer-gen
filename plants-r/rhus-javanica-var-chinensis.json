    "intro": "Rhus javanica var. chinensis, commonly known as Chinese sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China and parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically pinnately arranged and have serrated margins. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in panicles, followed by bright red, fleshy fruits that are clustered in globose heads. Its bark is smooth and grayish, with a distinctive fissured texture. This species is often used in traditional medicine and as an ornamental plant due to its seasonal color changes and hardy nature."
