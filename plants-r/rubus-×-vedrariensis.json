It is a natural hybrid between Rubus ursinus (blackberry) and Rubus chamaemorus (cloudberry), resulting in a plant with unique botanical characteristics. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils in temperate regions, often found in boreal and subarctic climates. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it produces small, aggregate fruits that are a mix of blackberry and raspberry flavors. The plant is valued for its ornamental value and its edible fruits, which are rich in antioxidants."
