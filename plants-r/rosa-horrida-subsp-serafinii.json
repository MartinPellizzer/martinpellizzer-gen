    "intro": "Rosa horrida subsp. serafinii, commonly known as the Serafini's prickly rose, is a rare and ornamental species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, thorned stems and clusters of small, pale pink to white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. Its foliage consists of dark green, ovate leaves with serrated edges, and it produces fragrant, five-petaled blooms. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a botanical curiosity and is often cultivated in specialized gardens."
