It has soft, broad, waxy leaves that form a rosette at the water's surface, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellow in color. Its roots are anchored in the water and help stabilize the substrate. Rotala elatinomorpha is often used in aquariums and ponds for its ornamental value and ability to provide habitat for aquatic life."
