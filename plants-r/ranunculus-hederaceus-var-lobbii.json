    "intro": "Ranunculus hederaceus var. lobbii, commonly known as the creeping buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It features a low-growing, spreading habit with glossy, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, making it both a persistent weed and a hardy ornamental plant."
