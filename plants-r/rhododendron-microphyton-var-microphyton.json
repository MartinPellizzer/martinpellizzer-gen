    "intro": "Rhododendron microphyton var. microphyton, commonly known as the dwarf rhododendron, is a compact evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It features dense, dark green foliage with small, leathery leaves that are typically no more than 1 inch in length. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Due to its compact size and ornamental value, it is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover."
