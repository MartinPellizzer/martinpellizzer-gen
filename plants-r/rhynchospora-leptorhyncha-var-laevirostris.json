    "intro": "Rhynchospora leptorhyncha var. laevirostris, commonly known as the narrow-beaked sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy environments in North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, characterized by its grass-like appearance and specialized inflorescence structures. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with narrow, grass-like leaves and spikelets arranged in dense clusters. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, adapted for wind pollination, and it produces small, three-angled berries. This variety is distinguished by its slender, elongated beak on the fruit, which is a key identifying feature."
