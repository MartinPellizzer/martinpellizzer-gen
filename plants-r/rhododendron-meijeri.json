    "intro": "Rhododendron meijeri, commonly known as the Japanese azalea, is a compact evergreen shrub native to Japan. It features dense, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces clusters of showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance, it is widely cultivated in temperate regions."
