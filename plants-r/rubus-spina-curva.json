    "intro": "Rubus spina-curva, commonly known as the hooked raspberry, is a species of brambles native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its thorny stems and aggregate fruits, which are typically red or yellow when ripe. The plant produces small, white to pink flowers that bloom in the spring. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the plant thrives in moist, shaded environments. Rubus spina-curva is often found in forests and along stream banks, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
