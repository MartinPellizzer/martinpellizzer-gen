    "intro": "Rosa grypacena, commonly known as the Armenian rose, is a species of flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and Central Asia. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring thorny stems and dark green, lobed leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant pink flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, hairy fruits known as hips. Rosa grypacena is valued for its ornamental appeal and has also been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to the harsh, high-altitude environments where it thrives."
