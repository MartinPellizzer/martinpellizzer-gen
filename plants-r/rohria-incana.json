    "intro": "Rohria incana, commonly known as the woolly rohria, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, silver-gray foliage, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. It is often found in rocky or sandy soils at high altitudes. Rohria incana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
