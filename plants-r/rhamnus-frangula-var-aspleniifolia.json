    "intro": "Rhamnus frangula var. aspleniifolia, commonly known as the asplenium-leafed buckthorn, is a shrub native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its alternate, pinnately compound leaves that resemble those of the genus Asplenium, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in axillary clusters, followed by dark blue berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and streamside areas. The species is valued for its ornamental foliage and has been used in traditional medicine for its laxative properties."
