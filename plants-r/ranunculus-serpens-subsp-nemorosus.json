    "intro": "Ranunculus serpens subsp. nemorosus, commonly known as the woodland buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It features delicate, yellow flowers with five to seven petals, typically appearing in early spring. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable species for ecological studies and garden cultivation in suitable climates."
