    "intro": "Rhynchosia schomburgkii f. pallida, commonly known as the pale-flowered snout bean, is a variant of the species Rhynchosia schomburgkii, which belongs to the legume family Fabaceae. It is characterized by its pale yellow to white flowers, which are often more subdued in color compared to the typical red or orange blooms of the species. The plant typically grows as a climbing vine with trifoliate leaves and produces pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It is native to tropical regions of South America and is often found in humid, shaded environments. The pale-flowered form is of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its unique coloration and potential ornamental value."
