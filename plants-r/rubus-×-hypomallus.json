    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 hypomallus, commonly known as the blackberry bramble, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Rubus ursinus (the American blackberry) and Rubus chamaemorus (the cloudberry). It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves, typical of the Rubus genus. The plant produces aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black in color, with a tart and slightly sweet flavor. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and agricultural contexts."
