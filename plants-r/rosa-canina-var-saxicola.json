    "intro": "Rosa canina var. saxicola, commonly known as the alpine rose or saxicola rose, is a subspecies of the dog rose that is adapted to harsh mountain environments. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine regions, where it thrives in rocky and well-drained soils. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink, often blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets, and it has thorny stems typical of the Rosa genus. This resilient plant is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and ornamental value in cooler climates."
