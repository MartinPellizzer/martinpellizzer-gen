It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges and a robust root system. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in wetlands, riverbanks, and floodplains. It produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in the spring, followed by triangular, hard seeds. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
