    "intro": "Rumex brevipes, commonly known as the short-stem dock, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along riverbanks. The plant features erect, branching stems with lance-shaped leaves that have a waxy, slightly rough texture. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in loose inflorescences and bloom in late spring to early summer. Rumex brevipes is characterized by its ability to thrive in temperate climates and its role in supporting local insect populations."
