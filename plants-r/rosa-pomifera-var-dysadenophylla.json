It is characterized by its large, fleshy, apple-like fruits that are edible and have a sweet, aromatic flavor. The plant is native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas and thrives in cool, temperate climates. Its leaves are compound, with serrated edges, and its flowers are typically pink or white, adding ornamental value. The plant is notable for its ability to produce fruit without the need for cross-pollination, making it a fascinating subject in botanical studies."
