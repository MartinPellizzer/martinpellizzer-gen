    "intro": "Russelia, commonly known as the \"flower of the Andes,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It is native to South America, particularly the Andean regions, and includes several species such as Russelia equisetifolia. These plants are characterized by their vibrant, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange, often resembling those of the trumpet vine. Russelia plants typically grow as shrubs or small trees, and they thrive in moist, well-drained soils. They are popular in horticulture for their ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators like hummingbirds."
