    "intro": "Rosa nigrans subf. incaerulans, commonly known as the blue-black rose, is a rare and striking variant of the Rosa nigrans species. It is characterized by its deep, almost black petals that often appear blue under certain light conditions. This subspecies is native to the mountainous regions of South America, particularly in Ecuador and Peru. The plant typically grows as a shrub with thorny stems and produces fragrant, single flowers. Its unique coloration and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and horticulturists alike."
