    "intro": "Racosperma retiveneum subsp. clandestinum, commonly known as the secret racosperma, is a rare and elusive shrub native to the tropical regions of northern Australia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, elongated leaves and clustered, yellowish-white flowers. The plant is typically found in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its restricted distribution and limited population size, it is considered a vulnerable species. Its botanical significance lies in its unique adaptations to harsh environmental conditions and its role in local ecosystems."
