    "intro": "Ritchiea oreophila, commonly known as the mountain ritchiea, is a rare cycad species native to the high-altitude regions of New Guinea. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and a crown of feather-like leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Ritchiea oreophila thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to cool, moist climates. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species."
