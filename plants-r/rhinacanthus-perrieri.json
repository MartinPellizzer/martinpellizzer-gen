    "intro": "Rhinacanthus perrieri, commonly known as the Malabar nightshade, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, erect stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly serrated margin. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by orange-red berries that contain seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. Due to its toxic properties, it is not typically cultivated for ornamental or agricultural purposes."
