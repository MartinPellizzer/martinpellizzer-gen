    "intro": "Rudbeckia serotina f. dichrona, commonly known as the late flowering rough coneflower, is a botanical variant of the common coneflower. It is characterized by its distinctive, showy yellow-orange disk flowers and dark green, rough-textured leaves. This plant typically grows in moist to wet soils in prairies and wetlands. Its blooming period extends into late summer and early fall, making it a valuable addition to native gardens. The 'dichrona' form is notable for its delayed flowering compared to the typical variety, enhancing its ornamental value in late-season landscapes."
