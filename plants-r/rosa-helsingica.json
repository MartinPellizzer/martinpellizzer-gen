    "intro": "Rosa helsingica, commonly known as the Helsingfors rose, is a rare and ornamental shrub native to Finland. It features upright stems with thorny growth and produces fragrant, pink to red flowers in late summer. The plant has deeply lobed, dark green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its limited natural range, it is considered a valuable species in botanical gardens and conservation efforts."
