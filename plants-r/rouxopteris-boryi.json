    "intro": "Rouxopteris boryi, commonly known as the Bory's fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its intricate, lace-like fronds that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically found in the undergrowth of tropical forests. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the forest floor, while its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of its leaves. Due to habitat loss, Rouxopteris boryi is considered vulnerable and is often sought after by botanists and conservationists."
