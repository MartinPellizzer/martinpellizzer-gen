    "intro": "Ricinus communis f. purpurascens, commonly known as the crimson castor plant, is a striking variant of the castor oil plant. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that are often tinged with a vibrant red or purplish hue, especially along the veins. The plant produces distinctive spiny capsules that contain toxic seeds, which are a key feature of the species. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens, though care must be taken due to its poisonous nature. The plant thrives in warm climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
