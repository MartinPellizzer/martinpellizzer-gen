    "intro": "Roella bryoides, commonly known as the moss-like sea lettuce, is a green alga that thrives in marine environments. It forms dense, green to brown tufts that resemble moss, often found on rocky substrates in shallow coastal waters. The plant has a simple, branched structure with a thin, gelatinous cell wall that helps it retain moisture. It reproduces through the release of motile zoospores, which develop into new thallus structures. Roella bryoides plays a vital role in coastal ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various marine organisms."
