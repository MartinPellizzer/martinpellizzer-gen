    "intro": "Rubus sirnaquensis, commonly known as the Sirnaquen blackberry, is a species of brambles native to the mountainous regions of eastern Europe. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, dark purple berries that are rich in antioxidants and have a tart flavor. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species in its native habitat."
