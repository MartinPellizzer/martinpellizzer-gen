    "intro": "Rubus hobroensis, commonly known as Hobro's blackberry, is a species of brambles native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves, typical of the Rubus genus. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are usually dark purple to black in color. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including grasslands and disturbed soils. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and less-studied species within its native range."
