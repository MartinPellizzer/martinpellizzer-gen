It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and produces spikelets that are typically hairy and arranged in dense clusters. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune environments. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and is adapted to withstand saline and arid conditions. Rytidosperma telematicum plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and is of interest in ecological and botanical studies."
