It is a naturally occurring hybrid between Rubus ursinus (blackberry) and Rubus idaeus (raspberry), resulting in a plant with unique fruit characteristics. The plant typically grows in temperate regions and thrives in well-drained soil with full sun exposure. Its stems are covered in stinging hairs, and its leaves are compound with serrated edges. The fruit, which can be either a blackberry or raspberry depending on the parent species, is aggregate, containing multiple small drupelets."
