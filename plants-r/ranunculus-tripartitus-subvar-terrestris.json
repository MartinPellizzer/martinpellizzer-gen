    "intro": "Ranunculus tripartitus subvar. terrestris, commonly known as the creeping buttercup, is a low-growing perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features a mat-forming growth habit with prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread extensively. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in early spring. Its leaves are trifoliate, composed of three oval to heart-shaped leaflets, and are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in wet meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges."
