It is characterized by its serrated leaf margins, which distinguish it from the typical form of the plant. This fern-like plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate forest understories. Its fronds are usually lance-shaped and can reach lengths of up to 30 centimeters. The plant is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
