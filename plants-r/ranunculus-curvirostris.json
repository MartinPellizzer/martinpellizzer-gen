It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family, characterized by its showy, usually yellow or white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shady habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are palmately divided, and the flowers have five to ten sepals that resemble petals. The species is known for its distinctive beak-like shape at the base of the flower, which gives it its common name."
