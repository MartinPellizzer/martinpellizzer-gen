It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and thorny stems, typical of many Rubus species. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are usually white or pale yellow in color, distinguishing it from other blackberry varieties. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil. This species is often found in disturbed areas and is valued for its ornamental and edible qualities."
