    "intro": "Rhynchospora fujiiana f. scabrista, commonly known as the scabrous flat sedge, is a variant of the species Rhynchospora fujiiana, which belongs to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered with a rough, scabrous texture, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, thriving in moist, nutrient-poor soils. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, three-lobed flowers, which are usually greenish or reddish in color. This botanical feature makes it an important species for ecological studies in wetland ecosystems."
