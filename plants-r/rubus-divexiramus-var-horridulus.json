    "intro": "Rubus divexiramus var. horridulus, commonly known as the rough-fruited blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to specific regions of North America. It is characterized by its densely hairy stems and leaves, which give it a rugged appearance. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically harvested in late summer. Its foliage is often described as having a distinctive, bristly texture due to the presence of fine, stiff hairs. This variant is valued for both its ornamental qualities and its edible fruits, though it is less commonly cultivated than other blackberry varieties."
