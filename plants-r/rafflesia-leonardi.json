    "intro": "Rafflesia leonardi, commonly known as the Leonard's Rafflesia, is a parasitic flowering plant native to the rainforests of Indonesia. It is notable for producing the world's largest individual flower, which can reach up to 1 meter in diameter. The plant lacks leaves, stems, and roots, relying entirely on its host vine for nutrients. Its flowers emit a strong odor resembling decaying meat to attract pollinators such as flies and beetles. Due to habitat destruction, Rafflesia leonardi is critically endangered and remains one of the rarest and least understood plants in the world."
