    "intro": "Racosperma hastulatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, zigzagging stems and small, yellow pea-like flowers. The plant produces pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are often dispersed by wind. Racosperma hastulatum is typically found in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. Its ecological importance includes nitrogen fixation, which enriches the soil and supports other plant life."
