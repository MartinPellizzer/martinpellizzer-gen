    "intro": "Renanthera matutina var. breviflora, commonly known as the morning orchid, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that bloom in the early morning. The plant typically grows as an epiphytic orchid, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are broad and dark green, and it produces small, clustered inflorescences. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in warm, humid environments."
