    "intro": "Ricinocarpus alternifolius, commonly known as the sea hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in sandy or saline soils, often near the shoreline. The plant features alternate, palmate leaves that are usually green with a waxy surface to reduce water loss. Its showy yellow flowers are followed by bright orange or red fruits that split open to release seeds. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species."
