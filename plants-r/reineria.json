    "intro": "Reineria, commonly known as the \"false arum,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Araceae. These plants are characterized by their unique inflorescence, which consists of a spadix surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. Reineria species are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, often in wetlands or along riverbanks. They have simple, alternate leaves that are usually broad and pointed. The genus includes around 150 species, many of which are cultivated for their ornamental value."
