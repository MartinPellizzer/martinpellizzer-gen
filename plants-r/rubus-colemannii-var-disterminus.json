    "intro": "Rubus colemannii var. disterminus, commonly known as the Desert raspberry, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its thorny stems and small, aggregate fruits that ripen to a deep red color. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low precipitation. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it produces white to pale pink flowers in the spring. This species plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for wildlife and stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
