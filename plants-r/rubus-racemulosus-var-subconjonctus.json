It is characterized by its dense, thorny bushes and small, dark berries that ripen in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and thickets. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the flowers are white with five petals. The berries are edible, though often tart, and are used in local culinary traditions."
