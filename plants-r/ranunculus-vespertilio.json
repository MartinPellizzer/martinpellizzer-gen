    "intro": "Ranunculus vespertilio, commonly known as the evening bell, is a flowering plant belonging to the Ranunculaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, cup-shaped flowers that typically bloom in shades of white, pink, and yellow. The plant has a short stem with trifoliate leaves, and its flowers open in the evening, hence its common name. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is often found in woodland areas and along stream banks, where it contributes to the biodiversity of its habitat."
