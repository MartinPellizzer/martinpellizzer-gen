    "intro": "Rosa coriifolia var. agrestis, commonly known as the prickly rose or wild thorned rose, is a deciduous shrub native to parts of Asia, particularly China. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, fragrant white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly serrated margin, while the fruits are red, hairy achenes that mature in summer. This plant is often found in woodland edges and rocky slopes, thriving in well-drained soils. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
