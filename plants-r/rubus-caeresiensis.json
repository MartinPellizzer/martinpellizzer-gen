    "intro": "Rubus caeresiensis, commonly known as the Caeresian bramble, is a species of flowering plant in the rose family, Rosaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in the Tien Shan and Pamir ranges. The plant is characterized by its thorny stems, trifoliate leaves, and clusters of white to pink flowers that bloom in late spring. Its fruits, known as raspberries, are small, aggregate fruits that are typically red when mature. Rubus caeresiensis is adapted to high-altitude environments and thrives in well-drained, rocky soils."
