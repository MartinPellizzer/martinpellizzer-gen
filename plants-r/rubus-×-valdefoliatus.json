    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 valdefoliatus, commonly known as the hybrid blackberry or loganberry, is a species resulting from the cross between Rubus ursinus (the evergreen blackberry) and Rubus gebleri (the brambleberry). It is a shrub characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves, which are typically trifoliate or pinnate. The plant produces aggregate fruits composed of small, dark red to black drupelets. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its edible berries, which have a tart flavor. Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits a range of morphological and genetic variability."
