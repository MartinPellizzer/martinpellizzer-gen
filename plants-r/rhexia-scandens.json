    "intro": "Rhexia scandens, commonly known as the trailing bluebell, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue to violet. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its stems are often trailing or climbing, allowing it to spread across the forest floor. Rhexia scandens is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
