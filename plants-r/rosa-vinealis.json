    "intro": "Rosa vinealis, commonly known as the sweet briar rose, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems, which can grow up to several meters in length, and its dense, arching growth habit. The plant produces fragrant, pink or white flowers in late spring to early summer, followed by red-orange hips in the fall. Its leaves are pinnately compound, consisting of five to seven elliptical leaflets. Rosa vinealis is valued for its ornamental beauty and historical use in hedgerows and garden landscapes."
