    "intro": "Rudbeckia beadlei, commonly known as the beadleaf coneflower, is a perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It features striking, bright yellow disk flowers surrounded by velvety, dark green, bead-like leaves that give it its common name. The plant typically grows to a height of 2 to 3 feet and thrives in full sun to partial shade. It prefers well-drained soil and is drought-tolerant once established. Rudbeckia beadlei is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
