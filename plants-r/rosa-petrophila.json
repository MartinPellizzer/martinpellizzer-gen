    "intro": "Rosa petrophila, commonly known as the alpine rose, is a species of flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is a shrub that typically grows in rocky, alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils and cool climates. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are usually pink or white, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps to reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Rosa petrophila is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
