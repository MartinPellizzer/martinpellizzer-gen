    "intro": "Rubus imbellis, commonly known as the softfruit blackberry, is a species of bramble native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and produces small, dark purple berries that are often used in culinary applications. The plant has serrated leaves and produces white to pale pink flowers in the spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and thickets. Its berries are edible but can be quite tart, making them suitable for jams and preserves."
