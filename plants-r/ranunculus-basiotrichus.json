It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with five petals, often accompanied by numerous stamens. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is typically found in grasslands and rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
