    "intro": "Rubus vestitus var. albiflorus, commonly known as the white-flowered bramble, is a variant of the bramble genus Rubus. It is characterized by its hairy stems and white flowers, which distinguish it from other Rubus species. The plant is typically found in temperate regions, growing in woodland edges and disturbed soils. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the fruits are aggregate berries that develop from the flowering stems. This variant is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
