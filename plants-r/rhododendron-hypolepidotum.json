    "intro": "Rhododendron hypolepidotum, commonly known as the dwarf alpine rhododendron, is a compact evergreen shrub native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It features dense, leathery foliage with dark green leaves that are elliptical in shape. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to white, typically blooming in late spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments with partial shade and well-drained soil. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine plantings."
