    "intro": "Rupicapnos longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed rock rose, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems and dense, evergreen foliage, which provide habitat for various small animals and insects. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, white or pale pink flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are typically narrow and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Rupicapnos longipes is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
