    "intro": "Rivasgodaya nervosa, commonly known as the slender-veined fern, is a species native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds with finely divided leaves. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. The plant's reproductive structures, including its sporangia, are located on the underside of its fronds, typical of many fern species."
