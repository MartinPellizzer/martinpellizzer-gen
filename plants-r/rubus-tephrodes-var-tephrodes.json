    "intro": "Rubus tephrodes var. tephrodes, commonly known as the blackberry lichen, is a member of the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its unique morphology and ecological niche. This species is a non-photosynthetic lichen, forming a symbiotic relationship between a fungal partner and a green alga or cyanobacterium. It typically grows on shaded, moist rock surfaces or soil, thriving in humid and cool environments. The thallus is usually dark in color, ranging from black to dark green, and has a crust-like growth form. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is often found in temperate regions with high moisture levels and minimal light exposure."
