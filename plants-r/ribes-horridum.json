    "intro": "Ribes horridum, commonly known as rough gooseberry, is a deciduous shrub native to North America. It typically grows in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features compound leaves with serrated edges and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring. Its fruit, a tart berry, develops in late summer and is often used in culinary applications. Ribes horridum is also valued for its ecological role, providing food for birds and insects."
