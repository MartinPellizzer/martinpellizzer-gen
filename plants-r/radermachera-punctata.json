It is characterized by its glossy, ovate leaves that are typically dark green with a reddish or purplish tinge on the underside. The plant produces small, pale green flowers followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in partial shade to bright indirect light and prefers well-draining, moist soil. Radermachera punctata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its attractive foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements."
