    "intro": "Rhynchospora nervosa subsp. ciliata, commonly known as the hairy thread-leaf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh habitats in North America. It typically grows to a height of 20\u201340 centimeters and features narrow, grass-like leaves with distinctive ciliate (fringed) margins. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, three-lobed flowers, which are usually pale green to brown in color. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, fens, and along the edges of ponds. Rhynchospora nervosa subsp. ciliata plays an important ecological role in supporting pollinators and maintaining wetland biodiversity."
