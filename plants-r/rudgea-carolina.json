    "intro": "Rudgea carolina, commonly known as Carolina rudgea, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its opposite, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a small, two-valved capsule that releases seeds when mature. Rudgea carolina is typically found in moist, wooded areas and thrives in partial to full shade."
