    "intro": "Rubus dumetorum var. camptostachys, commonly known as the alpine blackberry, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its erect or decumbent growth habit and produces small, dark purple to black berries. The plant features trifoliate leaves with serrated margins and thorny stems, typical of the Rubus genus. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. The berries are edible but have a tart flavor, making them suitable for jams and preserves."
