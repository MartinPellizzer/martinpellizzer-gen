    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 hypomacrophyllus, commonly known as the small-leaf blackberry, is a hybrid species within the Rubus genus. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, dark green leaves that are typically less than 5 cm in length. The plant produces edible fruits that are similar to blackberries but often have a more intense flavor. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its fruit yield and ornamental value. Its botanical features make it a unique subject of study in plant hybridization and horticulture."
