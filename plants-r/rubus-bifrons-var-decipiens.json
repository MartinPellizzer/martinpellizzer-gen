    "intro": "Rubus bifrons var. decipiens, commonly known as the deceptive blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to parts of North America. It is characterized by its dark purple to black berries, which are often mistaken for true blackberries due to their similar appearance. The plant typically grows in woodland areas and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it produces prickly stems that bear the edible fruits. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in both culinary and medicinal contexts."
