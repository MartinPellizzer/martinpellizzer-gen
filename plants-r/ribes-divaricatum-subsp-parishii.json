It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and streamside areas. The plant has alternate, oval-shaped leaves with serrated edges and produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring. Its fruit, a red, fleshy berry, matures in late summer and is edible, though often tart. The species is part of the genus Ribes, which includes many species of gooseberries and currants."
