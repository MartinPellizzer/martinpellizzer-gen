    "intro": "Rapanea usambarensis, commonly known as the Usambara holly, is a species of flowering plant in the family Lauraceae. It is native to the Eastern Arc Mountains of Tanzania and Kenya, where it thrives in moist, shaded forest environments. The plant is characterized by its evergreen leaves, which are typically glossy and elliptical in shape. It produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, dark blue berries. Due to its restricted habitat and threats from deforestation, Rapanea usambarensis is considered a vulnerable species."
