    "intro": "Rubus inclinis, commonly known as the slender blackberry, is a species of bramble native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and small, dark purple to black berries. The plant produces compound leaves with serrated edges and has thorny stems typical of the Rubus genus. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The berries are edible but are generally less flavorful compared to other Rubus species."
