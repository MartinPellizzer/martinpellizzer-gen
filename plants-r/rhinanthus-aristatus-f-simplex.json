    "intro": "Rhinanthus aristatus f. simplex, commonly known as the simple yellow rattle, is a flowering plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients while performing photosynthesis. The plant produces showy yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is typically found in grasslands and open habitats, often associated with grass species like timothy and meadow fescue. Its presence can indicate a healthy, diverse ecosystem due to its specific ecological requirements."
