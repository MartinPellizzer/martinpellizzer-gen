    "intro": "Rudgea citrifolia, commonly known as the lemon tree of Brazil, is a tropical plant native to South America. It is characterized by its evergreen foliage and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, yellow fruits that resemble lemons but are not related to citrus. Its leaves are ovate and have a slightly serrated edge, while its bark is smooth and grayish in color. Rudgea citrifolia is often cultivated for its ornamental value and its unique fruit, which has a tart flavor."
