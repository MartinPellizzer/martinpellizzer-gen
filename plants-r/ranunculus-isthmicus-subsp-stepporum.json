    "intro": "Ranunculus isthmicus subsp. stepporum, commonly known as the steppe buttercup, is a perennial herb native to central and eastern Europe. It typically grows in dry grasslands and open habitats, preferring well-drained soils. The plant features compound leaves with serrated edges and produces showy yellow flowers with numerous petals. It blooms from late spring to early summer, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a species of conservation concern in some regions."
