    "intro": "Rhododendron clivicola, commonly known as the cliff rhododendron, is a compact evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of China. It typically grows on rocky slopes and cliffs, where it thrives in well-drained, acidic soils. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink and white, often appearing in late spring to early summer. Its dense foliage provides habitat for various wildlife species, and it is well adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
