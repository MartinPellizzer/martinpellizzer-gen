    "intro": "Ranunculus crateris, commonly known as the crater ranunculus, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America. It is characterized by its delicate, cup-shaped flowers that typically range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant has compound leaves with three to five leaflets, and its stems are usually hairy and upright. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine regions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
