    "intro": "Rhynchosia erythraeae, commonly known as the red sandalwood or African red sandalwood, is a flowering plant species native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, red or orange flowers. The plant is notable for its hard, durable wood, which has been historically valued for its use in furniture and decorative items. It typically grows in savannas and woodlands, often as a shrub or small tree, and thrives in well-drained soils. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered an endangered species in many parts of its range."
