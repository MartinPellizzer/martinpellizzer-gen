It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically pinnately arranged with 11 to 31 leaflets. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by red, fuzzy berries that persist into the winter. Its bark is smooth and light gray, becoming fissured with age, and it is often found in dry, sandy soils. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing food and habitat for various wildlife species."
