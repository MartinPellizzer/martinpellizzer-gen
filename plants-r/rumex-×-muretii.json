    "intro": "Rumex \u00d7 muretii, commonly known as the hybrid sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Polygonaceae family. It is a naturally occurring hybrid between Rumex acetosa (common sorrel) and Rumex acetobursa (broadleaf sorrel). The plant typically has heart-shaped leaves with a reddish or purple coloration on the veins, and it produces small, greenish flowers in clusters. It is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in moist, temperate climates. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for study in plant hybridization and ecology."
