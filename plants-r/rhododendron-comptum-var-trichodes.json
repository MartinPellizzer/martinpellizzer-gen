    "intro": "Rhododendron comptum var. trichodes, commonly known as the trichodes rhododendron, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its leaves are dark green, leathery, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its natural habitat. The flowers are usually pink or red, and they attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
