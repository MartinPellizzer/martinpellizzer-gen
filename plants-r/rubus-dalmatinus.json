    "intro": "Rubus dalmatinus, commonly known as the Dalmatian blackberry, is a species of brambles native to the Balkans. It is characterized by its thorny stems and aggregate fruits that ripen to a deep purple-black color. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by the edible berries in summer. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils. The fruit is valued for its flavor and is used in jams and desserts."
