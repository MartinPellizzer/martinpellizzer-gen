    "intro": "Rubus imitans, commonly known as the mimic raspberry, is a species of brambles native to North America. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and the presence of prickly stems covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, edible berries in the summer. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three oval-shaped leaflets, and it thrives in moist, shady environments. Rubus imitans is often mistaken for other raspberry species due to its similar appearance."
