    "intro": "Rosa \u00d7 dumetorum f. microphylla, commonly known as the alpine rose or dwarf shrub rose, is a compact, low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features small, dark green leaves that are densely packed and often covered in a fine layer of white tomentum, giving it a silvery appearance. The flowers are typically pale pink to white, with five petals and a subtle fragrance, blooming in late spring to early summer. This variety is well adapted to cool, moist climates and thrives in well-drained, acidic soils. Its compact size and ornamental value make it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays."
