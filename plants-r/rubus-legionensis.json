It is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including parts of Europe, Asia, and North America. The plant is characterized by its thorny stems, trifoliate leaves, and aggregate fruits that develop from multiple small drupes. Its flowers are typically white or pink, and they bloom in early summer. Rubus legionensis is valued for its edible fruits, which are rich in antioxidants and have a sweet-tart flavor."
