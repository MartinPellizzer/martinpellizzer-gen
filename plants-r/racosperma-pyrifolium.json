    "intro": "Racosperma pyrifolium, commonly known as the flame tree, is a species of leguminous tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its striking, fiery orange-red flowers that appear in clusters during the warmer months. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and is typically deciduous, shedding its leaves in winter. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular ornamental plant. The tree's ability to fix nitrogen through its root nodules also contributes to soil fertility."
