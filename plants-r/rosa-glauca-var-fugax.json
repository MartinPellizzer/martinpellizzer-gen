    "intro": "Rosa glauca var. fugax, commonly known as the transient blue rose, is a rare and delicate variant of the Rosa glauca species. It is characterized by its pale blue petals, which are a result of a unique pigmentation caused by the presence of delphinidin. This plant typically blooms in early spring and has a short flowering period, contributing to its name \"fugax,\" meaning fleeting or transient. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in rocky or mountainous regions. Due to its rarity and ephemeral beauty, it is highly valued in botanical gardens and by plant enthusiasts."
