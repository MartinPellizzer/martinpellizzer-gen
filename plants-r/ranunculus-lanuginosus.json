    "intro": "Ranunculus lanuginosus, commonly known as the downy buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features delicate, nodding flowers with five to seven petals, typically in shades of yellow or orange, surrounded by a fringe of silky, white hairs. The plant has a basal rosette of heart-shaped, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in its preferred moist, woodland habitats. Its flowers bloom from late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The species is characterized by its soft, downy texture and is often found in meadows, stream banks, and shaded forest floors."
