    "intro": "Rosa hirtissima, commonly known as the shrub rose or the rugosa rose, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and thorny stems, which provide structural support to its dense foliage. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of pink to red, typically blooming in late summer. Its leaves are compound, consisting of five to seven elliptical leaflets with a coarse texture. Rosa hirtissima is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in gardens for its hardiness and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
