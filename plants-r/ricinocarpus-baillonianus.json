    "intro": "Ricinocarpus baillonianus, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Africa and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, dark brown bark and elliptical leaves with a glossy surface. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by woody, spiny fruits containing toxic seeds. It is valued for its hard, heavy wood used in construction and furniture-making, despite the presence of toxic compounds in its seeds."
