    "intro": "Rhus gueinzii var. spinescens, commonly known as the spiny smooth sumac, is a shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetlands, swamps, and along stream banks, thriving in moist to wet soil conditions. The plant features compound leaves with serrated margins and small, clustered yellow-orange flowers that appear in the spring. Its fruit is a red, fuzzy cluster of drupes that ripen in the fall. The species is characterized by its spiny stems and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
