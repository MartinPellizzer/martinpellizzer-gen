    "intro": "Ramium fallax, commonly known as the slender bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across moist, shaded environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to lanceolate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Ramium fallax is often found in woodlands, stream banks, and damp meadows, where it thrives in partial to full shade."
