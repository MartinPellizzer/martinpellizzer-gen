It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal areas. Rhus arenaria is drought-tolerant and plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils."
