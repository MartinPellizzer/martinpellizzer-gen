    "intro": "Ranunculus glacialis subsp. camissonis, commonly known as the alpine buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in alpine meadows, rocky slopes, and arctic tundra, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant features delicate, yellow flowers with 5-15 sepals that are often mistaken for petals. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a hairy surface that helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. The subspecies is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and is often found in mountainous regions of Europe, Asia, and North America."
