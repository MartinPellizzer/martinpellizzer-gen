    "intro": "Rebutia pygmaea f. haefneriana, commonly known as the Haefner's miniature rebutia, is a compact, low-growing cactus native to South America. It features small, globular stems that are typically green with a waxy coating, and it produces clusters of delicate, tubular flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red. The plant is well-suited for rock gardens and containers due to its compact size and drought tolerance. It requires bright sunlight, well-draining soil, and minimal watering to thrive. Its ornamental value lies in its vibrant blooms and unique, miniature appearance."
