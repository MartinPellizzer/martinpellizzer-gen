    "intro": "Rubus hystrix var. metuendus, commonly known as the prickly blackberry. This variant is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and dark purple foliage, which contribute to its rugged appearance. The plant produces small, edible berries that are typically harvested in late summer. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges or disturbed soils. Its botanical features make it both a resilient and potentially invasive species in certain environments."
