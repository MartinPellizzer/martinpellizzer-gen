    "intro": "Rhododendron orbiculare subsp. cardiobasis, commonly known as the heart-shaped rhododendron, is a compact shrub native to the mountainous regions of China. It features broad, ovate leaves that are typically dark green and densely covered with fine, soft hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to red, which bloom in late spring. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it suitable for rock gardens and shaded borders. The subspecies is noted for its hardiness and ability to thrive in acidic, well-drained soils."
