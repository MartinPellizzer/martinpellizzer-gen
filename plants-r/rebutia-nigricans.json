    "intro": "Rebutia nigricans, commonly known as the black-rooted rebutia, is a species of cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and short, cylindrical stems that are typically green or bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of yellow, orange, or red during the spring and summer months. Its roots are notably dark in color, which gives it its common name. Rebutia nigricans is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil to thrive."
