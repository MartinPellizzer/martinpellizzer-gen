It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring dense, evergreen foliage with leathery leaves. The plant produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and requires partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and long-lasting blooms."
