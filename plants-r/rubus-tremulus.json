    "intro": "Rubus tremulus, commonly known as the trembling raspberry, is a species of bramble native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often arching stems that are covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by edible, red berries in the summer. Its leaves are typically trifoliate, with three leaflets that are serrated along the edges. Rubus tremulus is often found in woodland edges, hedgerows, and other moist, shaded habitats."
