    "intro": "Ricinus communis f. atropunicatus, commonly known as the black leaf castor, is a striking variant of the common castor plant. It is characterized by its dark, almost black foliage, which contrasts sharply with its typical green leaves. The plant retains the typical castor structure, featuring large, palmate leaves and spiny calyces surrounding its seeds. It is primarily valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens and landscapes. While it shares the same growth habits as the standard castor plant, its unique leaf color makes it a distinctive addition to botanical collections."
