It typically grows in shallow freshwater habitats such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. The plant features bright yellow flowers with five petals, often surrounded by a ring of sepals. Its leaves are usually submerged or floating, with a waxy surface to reduce water loss. This variant is notable for its adaptability to aquatic environments and its role in supporting aquatic ecosystems."
