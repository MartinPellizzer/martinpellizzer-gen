    "intro": "Reichenbachanthus cuniculatus, commonly known as the burr cucumber, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, sprawling stems and large, heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by fruit that develops into a spiny, elongated capsule. Its unique fruit structure, which resembles a burr, is adapted for seed dispersal by attaching to animal fur. The species is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is notable for its distinctive botanical features."
