    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 polyanthus var. polyanthoides, commonly known as the evergreen bramble, is a hybrid shrub characterized by its dense, thorny growth habit and evergreen foliage. It features small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, often in late spring to early summer. The plant produces aggregate berries, which are typically red or black when mature, and are edible though tart in flavor. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a hardy ornamental plant in temperate climates. Its botanical classification reflects its hybrid origin from Rubus species, contributing to its adaptability and horticultural value."
