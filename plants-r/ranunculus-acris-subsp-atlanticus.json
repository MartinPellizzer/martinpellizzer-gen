    "intro": "Ranunculus acris subsp. atlanticus, commonly known as the Atlantic buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to coastal regions of North America. It features delicate, yellow flowers with five petals and a hairy, upright stem. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils along shores and dunes, adapting to salt spray and strong winds. Its leaves are palmately lobed and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing coastal habitats."
