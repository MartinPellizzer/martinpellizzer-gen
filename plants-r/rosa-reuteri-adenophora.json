    "intro": "Rosa reuteri adenophora, commonly known as the adenophora rose, is a species of shrub native to southern China. It is characterized by its dense, thornless stems and small, dark green leaves. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its botanical features include glandular hairs on the stems and leaves, which give it its specific epithet \"adenophora.\" It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in well-drained soil."
