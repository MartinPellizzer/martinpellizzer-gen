    "intro": "Raputia codo-pozuzoensis, commonly known as the Pozuzo raputia, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces striking, showy inflorescences with brightly colored flowers. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in montane forests or cloud forests. Its botanical features include fleshy, strap-like leaves and a short, stout stem. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
