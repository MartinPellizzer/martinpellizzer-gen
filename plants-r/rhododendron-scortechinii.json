It features clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to white, typically blooming in late spring. The plant has dark green, elliptical leaves that are arranged alternately along the stems. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and early spring flowering."
