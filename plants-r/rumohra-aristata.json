    "intro": "Rumohra aristata, commonly known as the silver sword, is a striking evergreen plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its dense, sword-like leaves that are covered in a fine layer of silvery hair. The plant forms a rosette structure with a central stem that can grow quite tall, often reaching several feet in height. Its unique appearance and ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils make it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine landscapes. Rumohra aristata is also valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in New Zealand's native flora."
