    "intro": "Rhammatophyllum kamelinii, commonly known as the Kamelin's spikerush, is a rare aquatic plant native to freshwater habitats in northern Europe. It is characterized by its dense, spike-like inflorescence composed of small, greenish flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow, still waters and is often found in peat bogs or wetlands. Its leaves are narrow and ribbon-like, often floating on the water surface. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
