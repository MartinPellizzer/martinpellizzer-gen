    "intro": "Restio cymosus, commonly known as the mountain restio, is a perennial grass-like plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Restionaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and unbranched inflorescences. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in coastal or mountainous regions. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are wind-pollinated, and its seeds are dispersed by the wind. Restio cymosus is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in coastal conditions."
