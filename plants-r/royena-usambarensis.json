    "intro": "Royena usambarensis, commonly known as the Usambara lily, is a flowering plant native to the Eastern Arc Mountains of Tanzania. It belongs to the family Aroidae, which includes plants like philodendrons and peace lilies. The plant is characterized by its large, showy inflorescence that consists of a spadix surrounded by a colorful spathe. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to the unique microclimates of its mountainous habitat. Due to its restricted range and habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable to extinction."
