    "intro": "Rosa tomentosa var. aridorum, commonly known as the desert rose or sand rose, is a shrub-like plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, fragrant pink or white flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in landscaping in dry climates."
