    "intro": "Rubus vulgatus var. spiniger, commonly known as brambles or blackberries, is a shrub native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its thorny stems, trifoliate leaves, and aggregate fruits that develop from multiple small drupes. The plant thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, loamy soils. It plays an important ecological role by providing food for wildlife and supporting pollinators. The berries are often used in culinary applications, though they can be quite tart when raw."
