    "intro": "Rosa kuhitangi, commonly known as the Kuhitangi rose, is a rare and endemic species native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its fragrant, pale pink flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant has slender, thornless stems and heart-shaped leaves with a glossy green surface. Its flowers are typically borne singly or in small clusters, adding ornamental value to its natural habitat. Due to its limited distribution and conservation status, it is considered a valuable species in botanical studies and ecological preservation efforts."
