    "intro": "Rubus occultiflorus, commonly known as the hidden-flower blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and small, dark purple to black berries. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white flowers that are often obscured by its dense foliage, giving it its common name. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the stems are covered in fine, prickly hairs. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
