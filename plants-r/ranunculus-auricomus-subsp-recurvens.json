    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus subsp. recurvens, commonly known as the recurved buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, yellow flowers with five broadly ovate petals that curve outward, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are trifoliate, with lobed divisions that are often hairy. The subspecies is distinguished by its more recurved petals compared to the typical form of Ranunculus auricomus."
