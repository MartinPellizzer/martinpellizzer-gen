    "intro": "Rhodiola alsia subsp. alsia, commonly known as the alpine rhodiola, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and its ability to thrive in harsh, high-altitude environments. The plant produces small, pink to red flowers that bloom in late summer, and its leaves are typically fleshy and succulent. It is well adapted to cold climates and has a deep root system that helps it survive in poor soil conditions. This subspecies is valued for its medicinal properties and is often used in traditional herbal remedies."
