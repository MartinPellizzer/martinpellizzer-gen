    "intro": "Rhamphidia grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered rhamphidia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, often with a subtle fragrance. The plant typically grows as an erect shrub, reaching heights of up to 2 meters, with lance-shaped leaves that are opposite in arrangement. Its flowers are borne in clusters at the ends of the branches, making it a visually appealing species for ornamental gardening. Rhamphidia grandiflora thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth."
