    "intro": "Rosa menstrualis, commonly known as the menstrual rose, is a rare and enigmatic plant with unique botanical characteristics. It is believed to bloom only during the menstrual cycle of women, though this claim remains unverified by scientific research. The plant features fragrant, pinkish-red petals and a delicate, thornless stem. Its leaves are compound, with serrated edges, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Despite its mysterious reputation, there is limited botanical documentation on its growth patterns and medicinal properties."
