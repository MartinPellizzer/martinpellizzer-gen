    "intro": "Roussea simplex, commonly known as the slender lily, is a flowering plant native to the wetlands of southeastern Australia. It belongs to the family Liliaceae and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and delicate, white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, thriving in humid environments. It produces small, elongated berries that contain the seeds, which are dispersed by water or animals. Roussea simplex is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological importance and ability to stabilize shoreline vegetation."
