    "intro": "Rosa sericea var. sericea, commonly known as the silverleaf rose, is a species native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-white undersides on its leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces fragrant pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is a shrub that can grow up to 3 meters tall, with thorny stems and alternate, pinnately compound leaves. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is well-suited to dry, rocky soils."
