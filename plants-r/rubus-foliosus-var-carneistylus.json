    "intro": "Rubus foliosus var. carneistylus, commonly known as the red-stemmed bramble, is a variant of the bramble genus Rubus native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its woody stems that often display a reddish hue, particularly during the growing season. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits known as drupes, which are typically red or black in color. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three leaflets that are usually serrated along the edges. This variant is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and along stream banks."
