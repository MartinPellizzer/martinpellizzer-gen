    "intro": "Rhus vernicifera, commonly known as the lac tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to East Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and compound leaves that are opposite in arrangement. The plant is most notable for producing a resin called lac, which is harvested from the sap exuding from its bark. This resin has been used for centuries in traditional medicine, as a natural dye, and in the production of varnishes and inks. Its botanical significance lies in its unique resin production and ecological role in its native habitats."
