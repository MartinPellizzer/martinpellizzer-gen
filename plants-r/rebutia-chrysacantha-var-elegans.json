    "intro": "Rebutia chrysacantha var. elegans, commonly known as the elegant night bloomer, is a compact, low-growing cactus native to South America. It features a spherical or oblate stem with a dense covering of white to light green spines. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, yellow flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Its slow growth rate and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting."
