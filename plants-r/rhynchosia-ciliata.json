    "intro": "Rhynchosia ciliata, commonly known as the hairy bean, is a climbing legume native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It features compound leaves with serrated edges and produces small, yellow flowers that are followed by elongated, bean-like pods. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which give it its common name. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats. Rhynchosia ciliata is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability and is used in agroforestry systems."
