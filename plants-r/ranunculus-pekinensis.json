It features delicate, palmately divided leaves and showy, yellow flowers with five petals. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It has a short stem and produces small, hairy seeds in a follicle. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
