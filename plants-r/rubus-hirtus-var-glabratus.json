It is characterized by its smooth, thornless stems and dark purple to black berries that ripen in late summer. The plant produces compound leaves with three to five leaflets, and its flowers are typically white or pale pink. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland areas or along the edges of forests. The berries are edible, though they can be quite tart and are often used in jams or wines."
