    "intro": "Ribes cereum, commonly known as wax currant, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its oval, waxy leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by edible, sweet-tart berries in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade. Ribes cereum is often found in rocky areas and is valued for its ornamental and culinary uses."
