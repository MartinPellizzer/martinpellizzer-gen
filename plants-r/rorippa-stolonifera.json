    "intro": "Rorippa stolonifera, commonly known as the creeping watercress, is a flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist or aquatic environments, such as marshes, ditches, and stream banks. The plant has alternate, ovate leaves that are often submerged or floating, and it produces small, yellow flowers in clusters. Its stolons allow it to spread rapidly, forming dense mats on the water surface. Rorippa stolonifera is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in nutrient-rich, wet habitats."
