It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with small, often succulent leaves. The flowers are typically small and clustered, often in dense inflorescences, and come in shades of white, pink, or purple. Rohria species are native to arid and semi-arid regions, particularly in southern Africa and the Mediterranean. These plants are adapted to harsh environments, exhibiting drought tolerance and efficient water use."
