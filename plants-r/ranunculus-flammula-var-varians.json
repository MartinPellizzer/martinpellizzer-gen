    "intro": "Ranunculus flammula var. varians, commonly known as the lesser celandine, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces bright yellow flowers with five to eight petals. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and colonize new areas effectively. It is also known for its early spring blooming habit, often appearing before many other spring flowers."
