    "intro": "Ranunculus sardous subsp. philonotis, commonly known as the Sicilian buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to southern Europe, particularly Sicily. It features delicate, palmately lobed leaves and showy, yellow flowers with a distinctive central greenish disc. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils along stream banks and in woodland margins. It is characterized by its short stature and early spring blooming period. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and threatened species in its native range."
