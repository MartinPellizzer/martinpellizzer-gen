    "intro": "Rosa glauca var. caballicensis, commonly known as the Caballic blue rose, is a rare and striking variant of the blue rose species. It is characterized by its pale blue to lavender petals, which are often described as having a delicate, ethereal hue. This variety is native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus, where it thrives in cooler, moist climates. The plant typically grows as a shrub with thorny stems and produces fragrant flowers in late spring. Due to its limited distribution and unique coloration, it is highly sought after by botanists and horticulturists alike."
