    "intro": "Rubus corylifolius var. nudus, commonly known as the naked leaf bramble, is a variant of the bramble plant native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often entirely exposed, lacking the typical hairy covering found in many Rubus species. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or black when ripe. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and ecologically significant species within its native range."
