    "intro": "Ranunculus ficaria f. cordifolius, commonly known as the heart-leaf buttercup, is a variant of the European buttercup characterized by its distinctive heart-shaped leaves. This plant belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It produces showy yellow flowers with five petals, typically appearing in early spring. The leaves are palmately divided and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. It prefers moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks."
