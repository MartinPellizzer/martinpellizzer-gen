    "intro": "Rhynchospora candida, commonly known as white beak-rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges and other grass-like plants. The plant is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in dense spikes. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a waxy coating that helps it retain moisture in wet environments. Rhynchospora candida plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and birds."
