    "intro": "Ricinus nanus, commonly known as the dwarf castor plant, is a species of flowering plant in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its small, palmate leaves and unique, spiny seed capsules. The plant produces toxic, sticky seeds that contain ricin, a potent toxin. Despite its toxicity, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
