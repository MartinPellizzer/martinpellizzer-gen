    "intro": "Randia ternifolia, commonly known as the three-leaf randia, is a tropical shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It is characterized by its simple, opposite, and often trifoliate leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruits are small, fleshy berries that turn red when mature. Randia ternifolia is often found in moist, shady habitats such as forest understories and along stream banks."
