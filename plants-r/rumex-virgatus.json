    "intro": "Rumex virgatus, commonly known as the narrowleaf dock, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its upright, hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves with a waxy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers that are arranged in a spike-like inflorescence. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and along riverbanks. The leaves and stems are edible and have been used historically in traditional medicine and as a vegetable."
