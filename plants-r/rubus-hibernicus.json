It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves, typical of the Rubus genus. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or yellow in color. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodlands and hedgerows. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
