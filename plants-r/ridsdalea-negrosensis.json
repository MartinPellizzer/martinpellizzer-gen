    "intro": "Ridsdalea negrosensis, commonly known as the Negros ridge fern, is a rare and endemic species native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in montane rainforests. Its rhizome is short and thick, supporting the growth of its upright, slender leaves. Due to habitat loss, Ridsdalea negrosensis is considered critically endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
