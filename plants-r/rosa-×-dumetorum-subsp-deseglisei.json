    "intro": "Rosa \u00d7 dumetorum subsp. deseglisei, commonly known as the Deseglise rose, is a hybrid shrub native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, thorny growth habit and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in scrublands and woodland edges. Its leaves are compound, with five to seven leaflets, and the fruits are red, hairy rosehips that persist through the winter.
