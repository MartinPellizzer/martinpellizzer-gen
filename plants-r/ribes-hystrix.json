    "intro": "Ribes hystrix, commonly known as the prickly gooseberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its spiny stems and oval, dark green leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are followed by edible, tart berries in late summer. Ribes hystrix thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a hardy plant suitable for garden cultivation. Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and horticultural contexts."
