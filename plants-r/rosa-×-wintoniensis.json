    "intro": "Rosa \u00d7 wintoniensis, commonly known as the Winton rose, is a hybrid species of rose native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and is typically found in coastal areas, where it thrives in sandy soils. The plant produces fragrant, semi-double pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It has been introduced to other regions and is cultivated for its ornamental value. Due to its limited natural range, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
