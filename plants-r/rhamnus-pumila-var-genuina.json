    "intro": "Rhamnus pumila var. genuina, commonly known as the dwarf buckthorn, is a low-growing shrub native to arctic and alpine regions of North America. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, dark green leaves that remain throughout the winter. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by small, reddish berries that are an important food source for birds. It thrives in poor, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. Due to its hardiness, it is often used in ecological restoration projects in harsh environments."
