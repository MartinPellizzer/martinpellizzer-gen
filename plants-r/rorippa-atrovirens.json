    "intro": "Rorippa atrovirens, commonly known as the black-veined watercress, is a small flowering plant native to moist habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other cruciferous plants. The plant typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, and its leaves are alternate, with dark green veins that give it its common name. It produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by pods containing several seeds. Rorippa atrovirens is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and other aquatic or semi-aquatic environments."
