It is a deciduous shrub with thorny stems and compound leaves, typical of the Rubus genus. The plant produces small, dark purple berries that are often overlooked due to their inconspicuous appearance. Its flowers are usually white or pale green, adding a subtle aesthetic to its foliage. This variety is adapted to moist, woodland environments and is found primarily in eastern North America."
