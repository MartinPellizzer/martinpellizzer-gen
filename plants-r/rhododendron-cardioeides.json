    "intro": "Rhododendron cardioeides, commonly known as the heartleaf rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is evergreen, with dense, leathery foliage that provides year-round structure in the landscape. It prefers acidic, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to thrive in cooler climates and its resistance to many common garden pests."
