It features showy, yellow flowers with five to eight petals, typically blooming in early spring. The plant has a basal rosette of palmate, lobed leaves that are covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and protected species in some areas."
