    "intro": "Rubus adornatus microgene oblongifolius, commonly known as the slender-leafed raspberry, is a species of brambles native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, oblong leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red when ripe, similar to other Rubus species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Botanically, it is distinguished by its unique leaf morphology and genetic variation within the Rubus genus."
