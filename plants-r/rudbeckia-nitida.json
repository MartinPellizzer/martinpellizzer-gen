    "intro": "Rudbeckia nitida, commonly known as the silverleaf coneflower, is a perennial flowering plant native to the United States. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and yellow-orange flower heads that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 2 to 3 feet and prefers full sun to partial shade. Rudbeckia nitida is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it a low-maintenance addition to gardens. Its ornamental value comes from both its foliage and its vibrant, daisy-like flowers."
