    "intro": "Rosa moschata var. nepalensis, commonly known as the Nepal musk rose, is a variant of the musk rose species native to the Himalayan regions of Nepal and northern India. It is characterized by its fragrant, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows as a shrub with thorny stems and dark green, serrated leaves. Its flowers are often used in traditional perfumery due to their strong, musky scent. This variety is valued for both its ornamental appeal and its historical use in the production of natural perfumes."
