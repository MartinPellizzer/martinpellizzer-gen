    "intro": "Ranunculus radicescens, commonly known as the creeping buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features a low-growing, spreading habit with rhizomatous roots that allow it to colonize moist, disturbed soils effectively. The plant produces bright yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in early spring. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a distinctive hairy texture, and it often forms dense mats in wetland or marshy environments. Due to its invasive tendencies, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural and natural settings."
