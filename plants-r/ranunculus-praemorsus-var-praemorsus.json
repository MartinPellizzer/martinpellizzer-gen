    "intro": "Ranunculus praemorsus var. praemorsus, commonly known as the death's-head hawkmoth plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to southern Europe. It features showy, butterfly-shaped flowers that are typically yellow with a dark center, resembling the face of a death's-head hawkmoth. The plant has palmately divided leaves with a distinctive hairy texture and a strong, often unpleasant odor. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its botanical significance lies in its unique floral morphology and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
