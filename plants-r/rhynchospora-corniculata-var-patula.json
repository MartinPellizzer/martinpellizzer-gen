    "intro": "Rhynchospora corniculata var. patula, commonly known as the slender beak sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, three-lobed flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes, swales, and along the edges of ponds. It plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic and terrestrial organisms. Its botanical features make it a valuable indicator species for assessing wetland health and water quality."
