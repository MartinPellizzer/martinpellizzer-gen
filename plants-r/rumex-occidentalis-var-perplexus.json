    "intro": "Rumex occidentalis var. perplexus, commonly known as the western sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive reddish tinge on the underside, which are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its roots are rhizomatous, allowing it to spread vegetatively and colonize moist, shady areas. The leaves are edible and have a tangy, sour flavor due to their high oxalic acid content."
