    "intro": "Rutaea floribunda, commonly known as the clustered angel's trumpets, is a flowering plant native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is a member of the Apocynaceae family, characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep purple. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 6 meters, with opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds, and it produces berries that are toxic to humans but may be consumed by certain wildlife. Due to its ornamental value and ecological role, Rutaea floribunda is sometimes cultivated in warm climates."
