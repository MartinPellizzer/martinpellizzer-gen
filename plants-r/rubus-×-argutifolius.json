    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 argutifolius, commonly known as the prickly raspberry, is a hybrid species within the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, aggregate fruits. The plant typically grows in temperate regions and thrives in well-drained soil. Its leaves are usually compound, with serrated edges and a slightly hairy texture. It is valued for both its ornamental appeal and its edible berries, though the latter are often tart and less commonly consumed compared to other raspberry varieties."
