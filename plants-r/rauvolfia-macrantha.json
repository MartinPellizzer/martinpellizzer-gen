It is a perennial herb that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy surface, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release numerous small seeds. The plant is notable for its medicinal properties, particularly due to the presence of alkaloids like reserpine."
