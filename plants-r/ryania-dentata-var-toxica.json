    "intro": "Ryania dentata var. toxica, commonly known as the toxic ryania, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves with serrated edges and small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. The plant produces small, round fruits that contain toxic seeds, which have been historically used in traditional medicine and as a natural insecticide. Its botanical significance lies in its unique chemical composition, including compounds with potential pharmacological applications. However, due to its toxic properties, it requires careful handling and is not commonly cultivated for ornamental purposes."
