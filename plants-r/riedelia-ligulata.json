    "intro": "Riedelia ligulata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf riedelia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes many aromatic plants such as carrots and parsley. The plant features slender, upright stems with finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a soft, white pubescence. Its small, yellowish-green flowers are clustered in umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family. Riedelia ligulata is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky soils and open habitats."
