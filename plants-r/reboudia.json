It is characterized by its fleshy, edible leaves and long, hollow stems that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often found in rice paddies and wetlands. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and have a slightly bitter taste, making it a popular vegetable in Asian cuisines. Reboudia is also valued for its ability to purify water and provide habitat for aquatic life."
