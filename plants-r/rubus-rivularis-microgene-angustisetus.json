    "intro": "Rubus rivularis microgene angustisetus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved blackberry, is a species of bramble native to moist woodland areas. It is characterized by its slender, thorny stems and small, elliptical leaves with a slightly serrated edge. The plant produces aggregate fruits composed of tiny, dark red to black drupes. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, often forming dense thickets. Its botanical features make it an important component of understory ecosystems in temperate regions."
