    "intro": "Rubus tomentosus var. setoglandulosus, commonly known as the woolly blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to North America. It is characterized by its dense, white to gray pubescence covering the stems and leaves, giving it a fluffy appearance. The leaves are typically trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are usually dark purple to black when mature. It thrives in moist, woodland environments and is often found in the eastern United States. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated for its edible berries."
