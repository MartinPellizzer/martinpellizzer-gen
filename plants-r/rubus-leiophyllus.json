    "intro": "Rubus leiophyllus, commonly known as the smooth-leaf blackberry, is a species of brambles native to the western United States. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and the production of edible berries that are typically dark purple to black in color. The plant features trifoliate leaves with smooth, leathery surfaces and thorny stems that often root at the nodes. Its flowers are small, white, and clustered in umbels, and it blooms in early spring. The fruit develops from the flower and is typically harvested in late summer, making it a valuable plant for both ecological and culinary purposes."
