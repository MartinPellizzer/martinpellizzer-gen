    "intro": "Rockhausenia carnulosa, commonly known as the hairy rock-rose, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and hairy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant typically grows on rocky soils and is well adapted to coastal and inland areas with low rainfall. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a hardy species suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Rockhausenia carnulosa is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
