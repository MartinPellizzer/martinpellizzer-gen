    "intro": "Ranunculus geoides, commonly known as the globe buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features small, yellow, cup-shaped flowers with five to ten petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has a hairy stem and leaves that are palmately divided, with a distinctive waxy coating. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain environments."
