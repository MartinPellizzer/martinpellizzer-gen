    "intro": "Rumex acetosella var. lancifolius, commonly known as narrow-leaved sorrel, is a variant of the common sorrel plant. It is a low-growing perennial herb with slender, reddish stems and lance-shaped leaves that are typically shorter and narrower than those of the typical variety. The leaves are covered in fine hairs and have a sour, tangy taste due to the presence of oxalic acid. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal medicine."
