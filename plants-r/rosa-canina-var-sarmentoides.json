    "intro": "Rosa canina var. sarmentoides, commonly known as the creeping dogwood rose, is a shrub-like variant of the common rose. It is characterized by its thorny stems that often grow along the ground, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white, followed by orange-red hips that are rich in vitamin C. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in hedgerows and woodland edges. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal medicine."
