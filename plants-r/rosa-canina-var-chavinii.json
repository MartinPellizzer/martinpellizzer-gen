    "intro": "Rosa canina var. chavinii, commonly known as the Chavinii dog rose, is a variant of the common dog rose native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula. It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, red-orange hips that are rich in vitamin C and used in traditional herbal remedies. Its leaves are compound, with serrated edges, and it thrives in well-drained soils in full sun. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting pollinators."
