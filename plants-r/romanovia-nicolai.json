    "intro": "Romanovia nicolai, commonly known as the imperial orchid, is a rare and exotic plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, velvety purple flowers with intricate patterns. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Its foliage consists of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Romanovia nicolai is considered a conservation concern."
