    "intro": "Rosa tomentella var. rhaetica, commonly known as the Rhaetian woolly rose, is a shrub native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, woolly gray foliage and small, fragrant pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountain meadows and rocky slopes. Its leaves are typically covered in a fine, white tomentum, giving it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with specific climate requirements."
