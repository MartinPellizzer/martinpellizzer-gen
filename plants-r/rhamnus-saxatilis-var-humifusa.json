    "intro": "Rhamnus saxatilis var. humifusa, commonly known as the low juniper, is a low-growing shrub native to rocky and mountainous regions of the western United States. It typically forms dense mats or cushions, often growing close to the ground, which helps it survive in harsh, arid environments. The plant has scale-like leaves that are tightly pressed against the stems, reducing water loss and increasing drought tolerance. Its small, blue to black berries are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. The plant's compact growth habit and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions make it an important component of alpine and chaparral ecosystems."
