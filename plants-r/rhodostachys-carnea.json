    "intro": "Rhodostachys carnea, commonly known as the redstem sandwort, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Montiaceae. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and is native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. The plant features small, pinkish to reddish flowers that bloom in dense clusters, often appearing in late summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. Rhodostachys carnea is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
