    "intro": "Rosa pseudocladoleia, commonly known as the mountain rose, is a species of flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring woody stems and dense foliage. The plant produces showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are compound, consisting of multiple oval-shaped leaflets, and the plant is adapted to thrive in cooler, high-altitude environments. Rosa pseudocladoleia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and full sun exposure."
