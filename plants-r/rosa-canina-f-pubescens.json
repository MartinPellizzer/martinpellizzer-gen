    "intro": "Rosa canina f. pubescens, commonly known as the bristly dog rose, is a botanical variant of the dog rose species. It is characterized by its dense, bristly hairs covering the stems and leaves, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces fragrant pink or white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by red, hairy hips that are rich in vitamin C. It is native to Europe and western Asia and thrives in well-drained soils. This form is often found in hedgerows and woodland edges, where it contributes to biodiversity and ecological stability."
