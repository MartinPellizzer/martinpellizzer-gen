    "intro": "Rinorea lujae, commonly known as the Lujan's rosewood, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or white, arranged in clusters at the ends of the branches. Rinorea lujae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its unique foliage and delicate floral display. However, it is relatively rare and faces threats due to habitat loss and over-collection."
