    "intro": "Rosa pimpinellifolia var. pseudomathonetii, commonly known as the Pseudomathonetii rock rose, is a rare and unique variant of the rock rose species. It is native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. This plant is characterized by its compact growth habit, with small, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to the harsh, arid conditions of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific environmental requirements, it is considered a botanical curiosity and a subject of interest for horticulturists and botanists alike."
