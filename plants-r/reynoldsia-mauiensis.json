    "intro": "Reynoldsia mauiensis, commonly known as Maui's ghost orchid, is a rare and endangered orchid endemic to the island of Maui in Hawaii. It is characterized by its unique, delicate white flowers with a striking purple lip, which bloom once a year. The plant is a terrestrial orchid, typically growing in shaded, moist environments within the native forests of Maui. Its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements make it highly vulnerable to environmental changes and invasive species. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect and propagate this rare botanical treasure."
