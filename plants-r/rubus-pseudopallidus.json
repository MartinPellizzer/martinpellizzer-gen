    "intro": "Rubus pseudopallidus, commonly known as the pale-bracted raspberry, is a species of bramble native to North America. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red when ripe. It thrives in woodland and shrubland habitats, often in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species."
