    "intro": "Rosa clivorum, commonly known as the alpine rose or rock rose, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense foliage, often growing in rocky or alpine environments. The plant produces showy, single or double pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are dark green, glossy, and typically have a serrated edge. Rosa clivorum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained, acidic soils."
