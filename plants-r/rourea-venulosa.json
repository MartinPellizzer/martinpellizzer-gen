    "intro": "Rourea venulosa, commonly known as the silverleaf rourea, is a shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with prominent veins that are visible on both the upper and lower surfaces. It produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in the spring. Rourea venulosa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in well-drained soil."
