    "intro": "Randia arborea, commonly known as the red mallow, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 6 meters tall, with opposite, ovate leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces showy, pink to red flowers in clusters, which bloom in the summer months. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that split open to release small, dry seeds. Randia arborea is often found in moist, well-drained soils in forest understories or along stream banks."
