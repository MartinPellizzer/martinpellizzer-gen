    "intro": "Rubus metuendus, commonly known as the dreaded blackberry bush, is a species of bramble native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its thorny stems, compound leaves, and small, aggregate fruits that ripen to a dark purple or black color. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or disturbed areas. Its berries, while edible when ripe, can be toxic if consumed unripe or in large quantities. The species is also notable for its ability to spread rapidly through vegetative reproduction."
