    "intro": "Rubus poliophyllus var. poliophyllus, commonly known as the broad-leafed blackberry, is a species of brambles native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its large, dark green leaves with a distinctive silvery underside, and its thorny stems. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that give way to dark purple berries in late summer. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, fertile ground. This plant is often found in woodland and scrub habitats, contributing to local biodiversity."
