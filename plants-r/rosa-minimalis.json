    "intro": "Rosa minimalis, commonly known as the minimal rose, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its small, simple flowers that bloom in shades of pale pink and white, often with a subtle fragrance. The plant has slender, thornless stems and small, lobed leaves that are covered in fine hairs. It thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, Rosa minimalis is considered a vulnerable species."
