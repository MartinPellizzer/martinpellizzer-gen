    "intro": "Ranunculus vicinalis, commonly known as the creeping buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, often calcareous soils and is found in meadows, riverbanks, and woodland edges. The plant has a sprawling growth habit with stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Its flowers are yellow with five petals and numerous stamens, and it blooms from late spring to early summer. Ranunculus vicinalis is characterized by its basal leaves that are lobed and have a distinctive waxy coating."
