    "intro": "Rhododendron dichroanthum subsp. dichroanthum, commonly known as the Himalayan rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Asia, particularly in Nepal, India, and Bhutan. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows at high altitudes, often in moist, shaded forest environments. The plant is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and clusters of bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. It produces small, elongated berries that contain the seeds, and it is adapted to cold climates with its thick, waxy leaves. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in its native habitat."
