    "intro": "Rhamnus pumila var. rupestris, commonly known as the rock buckthorn, is a low-growing shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in fine, white hairs, giving them a silvery appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by small, dark blue berries that are edible for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub and limestone habitats. Due to its drought tolerance and hardy nature, it is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions."
