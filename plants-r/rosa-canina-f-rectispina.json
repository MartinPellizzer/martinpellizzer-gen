    "intro": "Rosa canina f. rectispina, commonly known as the straight-spined dog rose, is a botanical variant of the common dog rose. It is characterized by its straight, stiff thorns, which distinguish it from the more typical hooked thorns of the species. The plant produces fragrant, pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its hips, which are orange-red and berry-like, are rich in vitamin C and are used in traditional medicine and culinary applications. This subspecies is often found in hedgerows and woodland edges across Europe."
