    "intro": "Ribes nigrum var. kolymense, commonly known as the Kolyma blackcurrant, is a variant of the blackcurrant plant native to the Russian Far East and parts of northern China. It is characterized by its dark purple to black berries, which are typically smaller than those of the common blackcurrant. The plant thrives in cool, temperate climates and prefers well-drained, slightly acidic soils. Its leaves are ovate with serrated edges, and it produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers in the spring. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its berries, which are used in culinary and medicinal applications."
