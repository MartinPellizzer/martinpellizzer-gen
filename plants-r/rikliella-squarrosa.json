    "intro": "Rikliella squarrosa, commonly known as the woolly rikliella, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering of fine white hairs on its stems and leaves, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pale blue or violet in color. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool temperatures and well-drained soil. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists."
