    "intro": "Rubus hypoleucus proles clavaudii, commonly known as the Clavaud's blackberry, is a species of brambles native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and produces small, dark purple to black fruits that are typically harvested in late summer. The plant features trifoliate leaves with serrated edges and produces white to pale pink flowers in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species in parts of its range."
