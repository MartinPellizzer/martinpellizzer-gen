It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its striking, colorful inflorescences that can range from red to orange. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and absorbing moisture from the air. Its leaves are usually broad and strap-like, forming a rosette that helps collect rainwater. This species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in humid, well-lit environments."
