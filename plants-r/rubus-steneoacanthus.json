    "intro": "Rubus steneoacanthus, commonly known as the thorned blackberry, is a species of bramble native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its prickly stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple or black when mature. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. Due to its thorny nature, it can be challenging to handle but is valued for its edible berries."
