    "intro": "Rosa canina var. attenuata, commonly known as the shrub rose or dog rose, is a variant of the common rose, characterized by its thorny stems and small, pink flowers. It is native to Europe and western Asia, typically growing in woodland edges and rocky soils. The plant produces red, hairy fruits called hips, which are rich in vitamin C and used in traditional medicine. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with serrated edges, and it is often cultivated for ornamental purposes. The species is valued for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions."
