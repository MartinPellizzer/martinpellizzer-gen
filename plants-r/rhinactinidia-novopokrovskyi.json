    "intro": "Rhinactinidia novopokrovskyi, commonly known as the Novopokrovsky's rhinactinid, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, clustered white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, temperate climates. Its leaves are finely divided and aromatic, often used in traditional medicine by local communities. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
