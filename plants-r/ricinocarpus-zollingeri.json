    "intro": "Ricinocarpus zollingeri, commonly known as the Zollinger's ricin tree, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its large, palmate leaves and showy, yellowish flowers. The plant produces woody pods that contain toxic seeds, which are rich in the potent toxin ricin. Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided in agricultural settings and is considered a weed in some areas. Its botanical features make it an important subject in studies related to plant toxicity and ecological impact."
