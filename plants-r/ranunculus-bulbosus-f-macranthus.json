    "intro": "Ranunculus bulbosus f. macranthus, commonly known as the giant bulbous buttercup, is a variant of the European buttercup. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 5 cm in diameter, with a yellow center surrounded by white petals. The plant typically grows in moist meadows and along stream banks, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are deeply lobed and have a distinctive hairy texture. This form is notable for its increased flower size compared to the typical species, making it a striking addition to botanical gardens."
