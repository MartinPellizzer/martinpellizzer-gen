    "intro": "Rhexia capitata, commonly known as the whorled pogonia, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces showy, violet-blue flowers in late summer. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodland habitats. Its flowers are typically arranged in a single, terminal cluster, and it is a member of the orchid family, Orchidaceae. Rhexia capitata is also known for its ability to form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption."
