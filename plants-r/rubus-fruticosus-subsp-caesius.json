    "intro": "Rubus fruticosus subsp. caesius, commonly known as the purple-fruited blackberry, is a shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that mature to a deep purple or black color. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. The subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and edible berries, though the fruit is often smaller and less sweet than other blackberry varieties."
