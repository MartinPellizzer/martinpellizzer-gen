    "intro": "Rosa brachycarpa, commonly known as the short-stemmed rose, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, arching stems and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant produces rose hips, which are the fruit containing the seeds, and these hips are often used in traditional medicine. Its leaves are compound, with five to seven elliptical leaflets, and the plant is well adapted to harsh, alpine environments. Rosa brachycarpa is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological role in its native habitat."
