    "intro": "Rhodiola litvinovii, commonly known as the Litvinov's rhodiola, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Crassulaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and clusters of small, pinkish flowers. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. It is known for its medicinal properties, containing compounds such as rosavins and salidrosides, which are believed to have adaptogenic effects. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
