    "intro": "Rosa \u00d7 dumetorum var. schergiana, commonly known as the Scherg's shrub rose, is a hybrid species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a low-growing, evergreen shrub with dense, thornless stems that form a compact, mat-like growth habit. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink to white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its foliage consists of glossy, dark green leaves with serrated edges, and it is well adapted to harsh, alpine environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in cooler climates."
