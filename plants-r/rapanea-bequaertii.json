    "intro": "Rapanea bequaertii, commonly known as the Bequaert's boxwood, is a rare evergreen shrub native to the island of Socotra. It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its dense, compact foliage composed of small, leathery leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences, followed by dark blue berries. Due to its restricted habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species. Its unique morphology and ecological significance make it an important subject for botanical study."
