    "intro": "Rosa arvensis f. subbiserrata, commonly known as the narrow-crested field rose, is a botanical variant of the common dog rose. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers. The leaves are pinnately compound, with serrated margins that are more refined than those of the typical species. This form is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats, showing adaptability to various environmental conditions. Its horticultural value lies in its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
