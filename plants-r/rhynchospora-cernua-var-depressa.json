    "intro": "Rhynchospora cernua var. depressa, commonly known as the flatleaf beakgrass, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland and marshy habitats in North America. It is characterized by its low-growing, rhizomatous structure and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often densely packed. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, pale green to brown flowers. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in areas with standing water or saturated ground. Due to its ecological importance, it is sometimes considered a valuable indicator species for wetland health."
