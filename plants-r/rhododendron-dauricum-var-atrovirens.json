    "intro": "Rhododendron dauricum var. atrovirens, commonly known as the dark green rhododendron, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It features dense, leathery leaves that are typically dark green with a glossy appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to purple, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to form dense ground cover in woodland gardens."
