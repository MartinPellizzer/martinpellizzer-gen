    "intro": "Rubus ischelus, commonly known as the alpine bramble, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its woody stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, white to pink flowers that bloom in early summer. Its fruits, known as berries, are typically red and edible, though they are often used in local traditional medicine. Rubus ischelus thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments."
