    "intro": "Rosa glauca f. superargutula, commonly known as the blue rose or blue flowering shrub, is a botanical variant of the Rosa glauca species. It is characterized by its striking blue or bluish-pink flowers, which are a result of a unique pigmentation due to the presence of delphinidin. The plant is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. Its foliage is typically dark green with a waxy texture, and the stems are covered in thorny buds. This cultivar is prized in horticulture for its ornamental value and its ability to attract pollinators."
