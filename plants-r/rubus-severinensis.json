It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or hedgerows. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
