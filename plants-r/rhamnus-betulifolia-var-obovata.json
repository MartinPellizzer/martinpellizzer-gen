It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-bark that peels in thin, papery layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are obovate, glossy, and typically dark green, turning red or orange in the fall. Its small, yellowish flowers appear in clusters and are followed by small, orange-red berries. This species is well adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions."
