    "intro": "Rosa vanescens, commonly known as the sweetbriar rose, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features thorny stems and is characterized by its fragrant, pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has simple, alternate leaves with serrated edges, and its fruit is a red, fuzzy rose hip that matures in autumn. Rosa vanescens is often used in hedges and for its ornamental value, as well as for its historical use in herbal medicine. It prefers well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight."
