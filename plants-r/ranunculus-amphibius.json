    "intro": "Ranunculus amphibius, commonly known as the water buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas. It features bright yellow flowers with five to nine petals, typically blooming from May to July. The plant has a slender, branched stem that grows from a rhizomatous root system. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three deeply lobed leaflets, and are often submerged or floating in water. Ranunculus amphibius thrives in aquatic or semi-aquatic environments, and its presence indicates healthy wetland ecosystems."
