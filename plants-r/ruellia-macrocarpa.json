    "intro": "Ruellia macrocarpa, commonly known as the large-fruited ruellia, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces clusters of blue to purple tubular flowers. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds. Ruellia macrocarpa is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
