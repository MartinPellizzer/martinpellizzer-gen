    "intro": "Rottboellia scorpioides, commonly known as the scorpion grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides. Rottboellia scorpioides is considered an invasive species in many parts of the world due to its rapid growth and ability to spread aggressively."
