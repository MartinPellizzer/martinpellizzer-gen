    "intro": "Ranunculus reptans var. filiformis, commonly known as the creeping buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features delicate, yellow flowers with five to eight petals, often accompanied by two sepals that resemble additional petals. The plant has a low-growing habit with slender, trailing stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a hairy texture, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its aggressive growth and ability to outcompete native flora."
