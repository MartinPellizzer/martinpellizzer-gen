It produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or orange in color, with a tart flavor. The plant has compound leaves with serrated edges and thorny stems typical of the Rubus genus. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial shade, often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
