It is characterized by its spiny stems and clusters of small, bright red berries that persist through the winter. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping in dry climates. Its foliage is typically dark green and evergreen, providing year-round visual interest. The berries are toxic to humans and animals, so caution is advised when handling or planting this species."
