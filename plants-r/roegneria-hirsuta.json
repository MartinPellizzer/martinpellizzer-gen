    "intro": "Roegneria hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Asia and North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and hairy stems, which give it its common name. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that contain small, awned florets. Roegneria hirsuta is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides, thriving in well-drained soils. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine in some cultures."
