    "intro": "Rubus idoneus, commonly known as the evergreen blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its thorny stems, trifoliate leaves, and aggregate fruits that mature to a dark purple or black color. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by the development of its edible berries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and forested regions. The berries are valued for their tart flavor and are used in culinary applications and traditional medicine."
