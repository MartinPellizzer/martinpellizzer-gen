    "intro": "Rhexia versicolor, commonly known as the pinkroot, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its showy, pink to rose-colored flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, woodlands and has opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its root system is fibrous and produces a reddish pigment, giving it the common name pinkroot. Rhexia versicolor is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
