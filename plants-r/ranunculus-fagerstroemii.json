    "intro": "Ranunculus fagerstroemii, commonly known as the Fagerstr\u00f6m buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features delicate, palmate leaves and bright yellow flowers with five to nine petals. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, preferring well-drained soils. It is characterized by its short stature and is often found in high-altitude meadows. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
