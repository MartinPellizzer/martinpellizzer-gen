    "intro": "Rubus ulmifolius var. petiolulatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved blackberry, is a shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dark, thorny stems and compound leaves with narrow, serrated leaflets. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically black when ripe, though they may retain a slight red hue. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or hedgerows. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in hedging and fruit cultivation."
