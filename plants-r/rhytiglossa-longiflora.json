    "intro": "Rhytiglossa longiflora, commonly known as the long-flowered rhytiglossa, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family, native to the humid forests of South America. It is a striking epiphytic plant characterized by its vibrant, long-lasting inflorescences that can reach up to 3 meters in height. The plant features broad, strap-like leaves that form a rosette, creating a water-holding structure that supports its unique ecosystem. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and good air circulation. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant, though it is relatively rare in the wild."
