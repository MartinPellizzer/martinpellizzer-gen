    "intro": "Raddia malmeana, commonly known as the Malme's raddia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants known for their distinctive leaf shapes and often vibrant flowers. The plant is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss in its high-altitude environment. Raddia malmeana is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to cool, moist conditions."
