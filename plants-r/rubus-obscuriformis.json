    "intro": "Rubus obscuriformis, commonly known as the dark-form fern-rose, is a species of brambles native to parts of eastern North America. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant produces aggregate fruits, known as berries, which are typically red when mature. It thrives in woodland and disturbed habitats, often forming dense thickets. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
