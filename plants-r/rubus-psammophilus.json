    "intro": "Rubus psammophilus, commonly known as the sand raspberry, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, edible berries that grow in clusters, typically turning red when ripe. The plant has adapted to sandy soils and can withstand drought conditions due to its deep root system. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it produces yellow flowers in the spring. Rubus psammophilus plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for wildlife and stabilizing sandy soils."
