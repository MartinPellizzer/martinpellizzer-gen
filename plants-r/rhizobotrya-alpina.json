    "intro": "Rhizobotrya alpina, commonly known as the alpine rhizobotrya, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, greenish-white flowers that appear in umbels. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine regions, where it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in its native habitat. Rhizobotrya alpina is often found in mountainous areas of Europe and Asia, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
