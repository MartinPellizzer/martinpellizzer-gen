    "intro": "Rhododendron haemaleum var. mesaeum, commonly known as the dwarf rhododendron, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It features dense, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and glossy, providing a striking visual contrast to its vibrant floral displays. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, showy flowers in shades of pink to red, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often cultivated in temperate climates for its aesthetic appeal."
