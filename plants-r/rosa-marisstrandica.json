    "intro": "Rosa marisstrandica, commonly known as the coastal rose, is a rare shrub native to the sandy shores of the Baltic Sea region. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and pale pink to white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has adapted to salty, well-drained soils and is often found in dune environments. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss. Rosa marisstrandica is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and supporting local biodiversity."
