    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 sharpii, commonly known as the evergreen blackberry, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Rubus ursinus and Rubus pectoralis. It is characterized by its dense, thorny growth habit and dark green, leathery leaves that remain on the plant throughout the year. The plant produces small, dark purple berries that are edible and have a tart flavor. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and fruit. Rubus \u00d7 sharpii is well-suited for coastal and maritime gardens due to its tolerance of salty air and wind."
