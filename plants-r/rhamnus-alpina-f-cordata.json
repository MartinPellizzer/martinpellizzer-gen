    "intro": "Rhamnus alpina f. cordata, commonly known as the Alpine buckthorn, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter on the underside, with a leathery texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, which are followed by dark blue berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in colder climates."
