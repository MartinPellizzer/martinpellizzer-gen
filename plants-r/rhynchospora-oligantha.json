It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes grass-like plants known as sedges. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, inconspicuous flowers. Rhynchospora oligantha typically grows in marshy areas, often forming dense colonies in still or slow-moving water. Its botanical characteristics make it an important component of wetland ecosystems, supporting diverse insect and bird life."
