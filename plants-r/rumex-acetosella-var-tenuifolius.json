    "intro": "Rumex acetosella var. tenuifolius, commonly known as narrow-leaved sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its slender, elongated leaves. It typically grows in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodland or heathland environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, which are borne on short pedicels. Its leaves are edible and have a tangy, sour flavor due to the presence of oxalic acid. This variant is distinguished from the typical R. acetosella by its narrower foliage and slightly different growth habits."
