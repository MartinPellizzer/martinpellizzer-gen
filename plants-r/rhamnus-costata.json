    "intro": "Rhamnus costata, commonly known as the Japanese buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to East Asia. It typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters and features small, elliptical leaves with a smooth or slightly serrated margin. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by dark blue berries in the fall. Its bark is smooth and dark brown, often marked with shallow fissures. Rhamnus costata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
