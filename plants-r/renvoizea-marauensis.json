    "intro": "Renvoizea marauensis, commonly known as the Marau orchid, is a rare and endemic species found in the tropical rainforests of Brazil. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and absorbing moisture from the air. Its leaves are narrow and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), adapted to retain water in its humid environment. Due to habitat destruction, it is considered a vulnerable species with limited conservation efforts underway."
