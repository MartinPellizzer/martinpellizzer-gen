    "intro": "Rosa gorinkensis var. glabrifoliolata, commonly known as the Japanese rose or the Kanzan rose, is a compact, ornamental shrub native to Japan. It is characterized by its dense, rounded growth habit and is prized for its showy, double-flowered blooms that range in color from deep pink to white. The leaves are typically small, ovate, and have a smooth, glabrous texture, contributing to its refined appearance. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. This variety is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic value and is relatively disease-resistant compared to other rose species."
