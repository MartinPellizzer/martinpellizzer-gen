    "intro": "Ranunculus quelpaertensis f. prostratus, commonly known as the prostrate meadow buttercup, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of East Asia. It features delicate, yellow flowers with five petals and numerous stamens, typical of the Ranunculaceae family. The plant has a prostrate growth habit, with stems that lie close to the ground, often forming dense mats. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a hairy surface that helps reduce water loss in its native habitat. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant, early spring blooms."
