    "intro": "Rosa glauca f. hardeggensis, commonly known as the Hardeggensis rose, is a botanical variant of the blue rose. It is characterized by its pale blue to lavender-colored flowers, which are typically single or semi-double in form. This form is native to the Alps, specifically in regions of Austria and Italy, where it thrives in rocky, alpine environments. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture, and its stems are covered in thorns. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique floral coloration."
