    "intro": "Rapuntium corymbosum, commonly known as the clustered rapunculus, is a herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its upright stems and clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces heart-shaped leaves that are often hairy and have a slightly bitter taste. Its roots are edible and have been used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Rapuntium corymbosum thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along riverbanks."
