    "intro": "Rumex \u00d7 interjectus, commonly known as the hybrid sorrel, is a perennial plant that results from the cross between Rumex acetosa (common sorrel) and Rumex acetobatus (water sorrel). It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive reddish or purple coloration on the veins, which is a trait inherited from its parent species. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in wetlands, along stream banks, and in disturbed soils. Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits a range of morphological variations that can make it challenging to identify without genetic analysis."
