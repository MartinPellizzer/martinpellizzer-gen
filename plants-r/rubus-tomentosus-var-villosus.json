    "intro": "Rubus tomentosus var. villosus, commonly known as the hairy blackberry, is a species of bramble native to North America. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and thorny stems, which contribute to its rugged appearance. The leaves are typically trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the plant produces small, white flowers in the spring. Its fruit, a dark purple-black berry, is edible and often used in jams and pies. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and thickets."
