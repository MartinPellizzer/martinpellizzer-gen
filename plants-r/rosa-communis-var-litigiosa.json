    "intro": "Rosa communis var. litigiosa, commonly known as the battle rose, is a less commonly cultivated variety of the common rose. It is characterized by its deep crimson petals and thorny stems, which are typical of many rose species. This variety is often found in wild settings, particularly in temperate regions with well-drained soil. Its botanical features include compound leaves and a strong, aromatic fragrance. While not as popular in gardens as other roses, it holds historical significance in certain cultural contexts."
