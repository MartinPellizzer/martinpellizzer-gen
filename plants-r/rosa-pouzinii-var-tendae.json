    "intro": "Rosa pouzinii var. tendae, commonly known as the Tendae rose, is a rare and ornamental species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of fragrant, pink to red flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has dark green, serrated leaves and produces small, red hips that persist into winter. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or alpine settings. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable species for botanical gardens and conservation efforts."
