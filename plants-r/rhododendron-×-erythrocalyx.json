    "intro": "Rhododendron \u00d7 erythrocalyx, commonly known as the flame azalea, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Rhododendron calendulaceum and Rhododendron viscosum. It is characterized by its vibrant, showy flowers that range from red to orange, often with a yellow throat, and are typically borne in clusters. The plant is evergreen, with leathery, dark green leaves that are elliptical in shape. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its botanical features make it both ornamental and ecologically significant in its native habitats."
