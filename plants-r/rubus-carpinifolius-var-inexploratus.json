It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, aggregate fruits. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in temperate forest regions. Its leaves are usually trifoliate, with serrated edges and a slightly hairy texture. Due to its limited study, much remains unknown about its ecological role and cultivation potential."
