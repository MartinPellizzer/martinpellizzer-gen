    "intro": "Rhynchospora corymbosa var. bonariensis, commonly known as the slender swamp grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South America. It typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and seasonally flooded areas, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences with pale green to reddish flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, contributing to its ecological significance in wetland ecosystems. It is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
