It features delicate, palmately lobed leaves and bright yellow, cup-shaped flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with hairy stems and a fibrous root system. It thrives in well-drained, moist soils and prefers partial to full sunlight. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain environments."
