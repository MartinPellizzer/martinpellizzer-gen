    "intro": "Rosa canina variegata, commonly known as the variegated dog rose, is a hybrid shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive variegated leaves, which display shades of white, yellow, and green. The plant produces fragrant, pink to red flowers that bloom in spring, followed by orange-red hips in autumn. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has been used historically in horticulture for its hardiness and adaptability. The variegation in its foliage makes it a popular choice for gardeners seeking visual interest."
