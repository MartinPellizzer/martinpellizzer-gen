    "intro": "Robinia nicou, commonly known as the black locust, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and have a distinctive gray-green color. The tree produces fragrant, yellowish-white flowers in racemes during the spring, which are followed by flat, pod-like fruits. Its wood is hard and strong, making it valuable for construction and furniture-making. However, it is also considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native plants."
