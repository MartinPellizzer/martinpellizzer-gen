    "intro": "Rosa glauca var. prosadenophora, commonly known as the blue rose, is a rare and unique variant of the Rosa glauca species. It is characterized by its striking deep blue petals, which are a result of high concentrations of delphinidin, a type of anthocyanin pigment. This variety is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, where it thrives in cool, moist climates. The plant typically grows as a shrub with thorny stems and produces fragrant flowers in the summer months. Due to its rarity and aesthetic appeal, it is highly sought after by horticulturists and botanists alike."
