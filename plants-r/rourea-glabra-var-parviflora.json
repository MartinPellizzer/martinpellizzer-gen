    "intro": "Rourea glabra var. parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered rourea, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are usually ovate to lanceolate in shape. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in umbels, and it is often cultivated for its ornamental foliage rather than its blooms. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is relatively easy to care for in suitable conditions."
