    "intro": "Rhus dinteri, commonly known as the Dinter's sumac, is a small evergreen shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are typically arranged in pairs along the stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are followed by red, fuzzy berries that are a food source for various birds and mammals. Rhus dinteri thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
