    "intro": "Rubus spinosissimus, commonly known as the prickly blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the western United States. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces aggregate fruits composed of small, dark purple to black drupelets. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and open woodlands. Due to its aggressive growth habit, it can become invasive in certain regions."
