It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring delicate, spiraling stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in mountainous forest regions. Its flowers, though not prominently displayed, are typically small and greenish in color, adapted for specific pollination mechanisms. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
