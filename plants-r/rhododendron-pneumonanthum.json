    "intro": "Rhododendron pneumonanthum, commonly known as the alpine rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its dense, leathery leaves and showy, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its flowers, which range in color from white to pink, are an important food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
