    "intro": "Ranunculus parviflorus subsp. chius, commonly known as the closed-flowered buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features basal leaves that are palmately divided with serrated edges, and its flowers are typically yellow with five petals, often appearing in clusters. The subspecies is distinguished by its closed or tightly folded flower buds that open only briefly in the morning. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a suitable addition to woodland gardens. The plant is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its delicate appearance."
