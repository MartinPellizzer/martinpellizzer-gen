    "intro": "Rotala mexicana f. media, commonly known as Mexican waterwheel plant, is a floating aquatic plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It features small, rounded leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stem, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are often submerged, followed by small, rounded fruits. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments and is often used in aquascaping due to its aesthetic appeal and ability to oxygenate water. Its rapid growth rate makes it both a valuable and sometimes invasive species in aquariums and ponds."
