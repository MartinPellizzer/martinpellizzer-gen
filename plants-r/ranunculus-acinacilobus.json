    "intro": "Ranunculus acinacilobus, commonly known as the swordleaf buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features a basal rosette of lanceolate, dark green leaves with a distinctive waxy coating. The plant produces showy yellow flowers with five to seven petals, often with a central tuft of stamens. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens but is considered invasive in some regions."
