    "intro": "Rubus hirsutus var. simplicifolius, commonly known as the simple-leaved bramble, is a shrub native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with fewer leaflets compared to other Rubus species. The flowers are typically white or pale pink, and the plant produces edible, though tart, red berries. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodlands and along hedgerows. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological studies and traditional herbal medicine."
