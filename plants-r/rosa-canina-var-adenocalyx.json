    "intro": "Rosa canina var. adenocalyx, commonly known as the narrow-leaved dog rose, is a variant of the dog rose species native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, elliptical leaves and fragrant pink or white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces red, hairy hips that are rich in vitamin C and are often used in traditional medicine. It is a deciduous shrub that thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in hedgerows and woodland edges. Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and horticultural contexts."
