    "intro": "Rumex leucocephalus, commonly known as white-headed sorrel, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of white flowers that appear in the spring. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands, swamps, and along stream banks. Its leaves are edible but contain oxalic acid, which can be harmful in large quantities. The species is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
