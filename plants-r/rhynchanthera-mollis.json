    "intro": "Rhynchanthera mollis, commonly known as the soft rhynchanthera, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in humid conditions. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, and the flowers are usually pale yellow or greenish-white, with a subtle scent. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Rhynchanthera mollis is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
