    "intro": "Robinia pseudoacacia f. erecta, commonly known as the upright false acacia, is a cultivar of the black locust tree. It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit, which differs from the typical sprawling form of the species. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces fragrant, yellowish-white flowers in summer. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardiness. This form is valued for its dense foliage and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
