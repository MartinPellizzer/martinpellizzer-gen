    "intro": "Rosa canina subvar. adscita, commonly known as the dog rose, is a shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and fragrant, pink to red flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces rose hips, which are the fruit and contain high levels of vitamin C. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in hedgerows and woodland edges. Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and horticultural contexts."
