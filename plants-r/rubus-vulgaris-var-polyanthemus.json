    "intro": "[WRONG START] Rubus vulgarus var. polyanthemus, commonly known as the bramble rose or sweet briar, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems, compound leaves, and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces red or black berries in the fall, which are edible but often tart. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a hardy ornamental plant. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for hedging and wildlife habitats."
