It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves with a rough, textured surface. The leaves are typically dark green and have a distinctive wavy margin. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which develop into capsules containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies."
