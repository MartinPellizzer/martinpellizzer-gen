    "intro": "Radiogrammitis setulifera, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are covered in fine, hair-like structures called setae. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizome is creeping and produces numerous small, clustered sporangia on the underside of its leaves. Radiogrammitis setulifera is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appearance in horticultural settings."
