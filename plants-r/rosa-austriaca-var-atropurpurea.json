    "intro": "Rosa austriaca var. atropurpurea, commonly known as the Austrian rose or purple-leafed rose, is a compact shrub native to Central Europe. It features dark purple foliage that contrasts strikingly with its pink to red flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a bushy growth habit with thorny stems and is well-suited for garden borders or containers. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it produces fragrant, semi-double blooms. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in temperate climates."
