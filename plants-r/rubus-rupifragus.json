    "intro": "Rubus rupifragus, commonly known as the alpine raspberry, is a species of bramble native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or black when ripe. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, often in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is well adapted to cold climates and can tolerate harsh environmental conditions."
