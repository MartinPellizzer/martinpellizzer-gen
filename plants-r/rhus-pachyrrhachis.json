    "intro": "Rhus pachyrrhachis, commonly known as the thick-leafed sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and have a serrated margin. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by red, fuzzy fruit that attracts birds and other wildlife. Its bark is thick and rugged, providing some resistance to environmental stress. Rhus pachyrrhachis is often found in moist, disturbed soils along streambanks and in woodland edges."
