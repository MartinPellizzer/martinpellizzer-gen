    "intro": "Ranunculus serpens, commonly known as the creeping buttercup, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its low-growing, rhizomatous habit, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant features heart-shaped leaves and produces small, yellow flowers with five petals. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Ranunculus serpens is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its aggressive growth and ability to colonize disturbed soils."
