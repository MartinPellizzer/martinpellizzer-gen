    "intro": "Rubus plymensis, commonly known as the alpine raspberry, is a species of brambles native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit, with thorny stems and compound leaves that are typically oval in shape. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are usually red or black in color, similar to other raspberries. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
