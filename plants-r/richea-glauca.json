    "intro": "Richea glauca, commonly known as the silver richea, is a flowering plant native to southern Australia. It belongs to the family Proteaceae and is characterized by its dense, shrub-like growth habit. The plant features narrow, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, giving it a silvery appearance. Its showy, pinkish-white flowers are clustered in spherical inflorescences, attracting pollinators such as birds and insects. Richea glauca is adapted to dry, sunny environments and is often found in coastal and inland heathlands."
