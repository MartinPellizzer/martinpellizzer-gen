It is a perennial herb characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and dense clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers. The plant has fine, hairy leaves that give it a soft, velvety appearance, contributing to its common name. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions.
