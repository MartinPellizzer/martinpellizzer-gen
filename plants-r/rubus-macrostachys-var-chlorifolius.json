    "intro": "Rubus macrostachys var. chlorifolius, commonly known as the green-leafed blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant characterized by its distinctively dark, almost black fruits. It is native to parts of Southeast Asia, particularly Thailand and Malaysia, where it thrives in tropical climates. The leaves of this plant are broad and elliptical, with a glossy, green surface that sets it apart from other Rubus species. It produces small, clustered flowers that transition into the edible berries, which are often used in local cuisines. The plant is valued not only for its flavor but also for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
