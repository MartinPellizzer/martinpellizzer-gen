    "intro": "Rosa jundzillii var. bichigeani, commonly known as the Bichigean rose, is a rare and ornamental shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces clusters of fragrant, semi-double pink to red flowers in late summer. The leaves are dark green, glossy, and have a serrated margin, while the stems are covered in dense, thorny prickles. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens for its beauty and fragrance. Due to its limited natural range, it is considered a rare and endangered species in the wild."
