    "intro": "Rutaea quercifolia, commonly known as the oak-leaved rutaea, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its large, lobed leaves that resemble those of oak trees, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries in the fall. Its botanical features include a woody stem, opposite leaf arrangement, and a preference for moist, well-drained soils. Rutaea quercifolia is often found in woodland edges and moist thickets, contributing to the ecological diversity of its habitat."
