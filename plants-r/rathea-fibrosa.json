    "intro": "Rathea fibrosa, commonly known as the fibrous rathea, is a perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its robust, fibrous roots that help it survive in dry conditions. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with narrow, grass-like leaves that reduce water loss. Its flowers are small and clustered, often appearing in shades of yellow or green. Rathea fibrosa is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
