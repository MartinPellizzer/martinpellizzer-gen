    "intro": "Rhizophora \u00d7 lamarckii, commonly known as the mangrove apple or red mangrove, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Rhizophora mangle and Rhizophora stylosa. It is a halophyte, meaning it thrives in saline environments, and is commonly found in tropical coastal areas. The plant is characterized by its pneumatophores, which are specialized root structures that facilitate gas exchange in waterlogged soil. Its propagules, known as \"seedlings,\" are buoyant and can float for long distances before taking root. This species plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms."
