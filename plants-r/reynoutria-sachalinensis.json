    "intro": "Reynoutria sachalinensis, commonly known as Japanese knotweed, is a flowering plant native to eastern Asia. It is a perennial herb that can grow up to 3 meters tall, featuring heart-shaped leaves and small, pale pink to white flowers. The plant has a robust rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread rapidly and become invasive in non-native regions. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found along riverbanks and in urban environments. Due to its aggressive growth, it is considered a significant ecological and economic problem in many areas."
