    "intro": "Rotanga calamus, commonly known as sweet flag, is a perennial wetland plant native to Asia and parts of Europe. It belongs to the family Araceae and is characterized by its aromatic, sword-shaped leaves and a thick, rhizomatous root system. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in a spadix, surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. It thrives in marshy environments and is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. The essential oil extracted from its rhizomes is valued for its pleasant scent and various industrial applications."
