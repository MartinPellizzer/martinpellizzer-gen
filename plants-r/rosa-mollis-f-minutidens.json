    "intro": "Rosa mollis f. minutidens, commonly known as the miniature evergreen rose, is a compact, shrub-like plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It features dense, dark green foliage that remains evergreen throughout the year, giving it a lush, year-round appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white to pale pink, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. Its compact size and ornamental foliage make it suitable for rock gardens, containers, and as a border plant. Due to its slow growth and cold hardiness, it is well-suited for cooler climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
