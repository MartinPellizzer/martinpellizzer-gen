    "intro": "Ranunculus montanus subsp. aurasiacus, commonly known as the Aurasiac mountain buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils and cooler climates. The plant features delicate, palmately lobed leaves and bright yellow flowers with five petals, characteristic of the Ranunculaceae family. It is often found in rocky habitats and meadows at elevations ranging from 2,000 to 4,000 meters. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
