It is characterized by its dark, almost black, stems and leaves that are oval-shaped with a serrated edge. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically a dark red to black color, which are edible but have a tart flavor. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and hedgerows. The subspecies is distinguished by its hairy stems and leaves, as well as its distinctive fruiting characteristics."
