    "intro": "Rothmannia fischeri subsp. verdcourtii, commonly known as the Malawi orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its vibrant, showy flowers that typically display a combination of red, yellow, and orange hues. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in its natural habitat. Its flowers are borne on branching inflorescences, and the species is noted for its ornamental value in horticulture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
