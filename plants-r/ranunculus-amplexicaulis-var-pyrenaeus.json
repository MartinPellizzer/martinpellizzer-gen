    "intro": "Ranunculus amplexicaulis var. pyrenaeus, commonly known as the Pyrenean water crowfoot, is a perennial aquatic plant native to the Pyrenees region. It features finely divided, floating leaves that are often clasping around the stems, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers with five petals, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and streams. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
