    "intro": "Ranunculus repens var. erectus, commonly known as the upright buttercup, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, calcareous soils along stream banks and wet meadows. The plant features a low-growing, spreading habit with upright stems that bear trifoliate leaves and showy yellow flowers with numerous petals. It blooms from late spring to early summer, producing small, bright yellow flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. This variety is distinguished by its erect growth form compared to the more prostrate habit of the typical Ranunculus repens."
