    "intro": "Rumex acetosella var. alpinus, commonly known as the alpine sorrel, is a low-growing perennial plant characterized by its succulent, heart-shaped leaves. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine regions. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are edible and have a tangy, sour flavor due to high levels of oxalic acid. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil in mountainous environments."
