    "intro": "Rubus mulleri microgene tremulus, commonly known as the trembling raspberry, is a species of shrub belonging to the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its fine, hairy stems and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in the spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible but often have a tart flavor. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges or rocky soils. Its unique trembling movement of the leaves in response to touch is a distinguishing botanical feature."
