    "intro": "Ranunculus salsus, commonly known as the salt marsh buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to coastal regions of Europe and Asia. It thrives in saline or brackish wetlands, often found in estuaries and tidal marshes. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are typically submerged or floating, and it produces showy yellow flowers with five petals. It is adapted to tolerate high salinity and fluctuating water levels, making it an important component of coastal ecosystems. Its presence indicates the health of saltwater environments and its role in stabilizing sediments."
