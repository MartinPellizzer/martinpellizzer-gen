It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, while its flowers have six petals, giving it its common name. Rhododendron hexamerum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
