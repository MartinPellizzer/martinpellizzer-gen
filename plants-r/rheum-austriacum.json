    "intro": "Rheum austriacum, commonly known as the Austrian rhubarb, is a perennial plant native to Central Europe. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in diameter. The plant produces tall, reddish stems that bear clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers. Its roots are thick and fleshy, containing the characteristic tart compound that gives rhubarb its flavor. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often cultivated for its edible stalks."
