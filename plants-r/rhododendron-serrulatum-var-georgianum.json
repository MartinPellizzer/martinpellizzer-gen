It features dense, leathery leaves that are narrowly elliptical and often have serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to red, typically blooming in late spring. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in cooler climates."
