    "intro": "Rosa suavis var. engelmannii, commonly known as the Engelmann's sweetbriar, is a deciduous shrub native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its fragrant, pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has compound leaves with oval-shaped leaflets and produces red, hairy fruits called hips in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its pleasant scent and winter-hardy nature."
