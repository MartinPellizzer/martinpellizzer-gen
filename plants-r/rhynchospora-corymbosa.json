    "intro": "Rhynchospora corymbosa, commonly known as the clustered spike-rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges and rushes, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense clusters near the edges of ponds, lakes, and wet meadows. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, arranged in dense spikes, and are pollinated primarily by wind. Rhynchospora corymbosa plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
