    "intro": "Ritchiea caloneura, commonly known as the narrow-veined cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of feathery, pinnate leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of cycads. Its slow growth rate and long lifespan make it a unique subject of study in botanical science. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
