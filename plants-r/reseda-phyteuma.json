    "intro": "Reseda phyteuma, commonly known as the common reseda, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many other well-known flowering plants. The plant produces small, yellow or white flowers that bloom in summer, and its leaves are typically linear and hairy. Reseda phyteuma is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in sunny conditions. It has been used historically in dye production due to its ability to produce a yellow pigment."
