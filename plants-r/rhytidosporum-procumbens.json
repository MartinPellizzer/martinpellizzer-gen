    "intro": "Rhytidosporum procumbens, commonly known as the creeping sandalwood, is a low-growing shrub native to the arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with stems that root at the nodes and form dense mats. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are typically narrow and linear, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Rhytidosporum procumbens is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland dunes."
