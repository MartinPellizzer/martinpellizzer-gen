    "intro": "Rosa tomentella var. obornyana, commonly known as the white-leafed rock rose, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and small, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, alpine environments. Its leaves are covered in a thick layer of fine hairs, which help to reduce water loss in arid conditions. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
