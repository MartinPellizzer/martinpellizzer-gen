    "intro": "Rosa alpina var. nuda, commonly known as the naked alpine rose, is a variant of the alpine rose native to mountainous regions of Europe. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, often in rocky or gravelly soils. The plant is characterized by its simple, naked stems that lack the thorns found in many other rose species. Its flowers are usually pink or white, appearing in late spring to early summer. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in harsh, high-altitude environments."
