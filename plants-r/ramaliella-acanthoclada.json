It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves, which are often covered in fine, spiny hairs. Its flowers are small, clustered, and typically have a yellowish or greenish hue.
