    "intro": "Rhynchospora hirta, commonly known as hairy spike-rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, commonly referred to as the sedge family. The plant is characterized by its cylindrical, grass-like stems and spike-like inflorescences that bear small, three-lobed flowers. Rhynchospora hirta typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, and it plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems. Its hairy texture and compact growth habit make it easily identifiable in its natural habitat."
