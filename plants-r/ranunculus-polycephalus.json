    "intro": "Ranunculus polycephalus, commonly known as the many-headed buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves and produces showy, yellow flowers with numerous small, petal-like sepals. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its flowers are often visited by pollinators like bees and flies. The species is characterized by its ability to form dense clusters of flowering heads, giving it its common name."
