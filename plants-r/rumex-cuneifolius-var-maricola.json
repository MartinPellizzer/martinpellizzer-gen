    "intro": "Rumex cuneifolius var. maricola, commonly known as the prairie dock, is a perennial herb native to North America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in prairie and wetland habitats. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands in suitable environments."
