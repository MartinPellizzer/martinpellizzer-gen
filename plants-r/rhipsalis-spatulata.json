    "intro": "Rhipsalis spatulata, commonly known as the spoonleaf cactus, is a species native to Central and South America. It is a climbing cactus with slender, green stems that often have a waxy coating. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers during the winter months. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it lacks the typical areoles found in other cacti. It is well adapted to humid, shaded environments and requires consistent moisture and indirect light."
