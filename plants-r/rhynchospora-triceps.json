It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of pale to brownish flowers, typically blooming in late summer. Rhynchospora triceps is often found in shallow water or moist soil, and it plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems. Its botanical features make it an important indicator species for wetland health."
