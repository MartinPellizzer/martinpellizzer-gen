    "intro": "Rhamnus minor, commonly known as the lesser buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring small, oval-shaped leaves that are dark green on top and pale underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by dark blue berries in the fall. These berries are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. The bark of Rhamnus minor is smooth and can become fissured with age, often displaying a reddish or brownish hue."
