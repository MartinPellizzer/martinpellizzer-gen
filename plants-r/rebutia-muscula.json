    "intro": "Rebutia muscula, commonly known as the Muscular Rebutia, is a species of cactus native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and dense, spiny stems that give it a muscular appearance. The plant produces small, vibrant flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red during the warmer months. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, and it thrives in well-draining soil with plenty of sunlight. Rebutia muscula is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor collections due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
