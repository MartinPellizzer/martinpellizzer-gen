    "intro": "Rhynchosinapis, commonly known as the spurge nettle, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Euphorbiaceae. It is characterized by its milky sap, which contains toxic compounds and can cause skin irritation. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is found in various regions across Europe and Asia. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a rough texture, while the flowers are small and clustered in a cyathium structure. Rhynchosinapis plays a role in certain ecological systems, though its presence can be problematic in agricultural settings."
