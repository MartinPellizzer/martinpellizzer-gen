    "intro": "Rosa cinerascens f. subduplicata, commonly known as the silverleaf rose, is a rare and ornamental plant characterized by its unique foliage and floral features. This cultivar exhibits a distinctive silvery-gray leaf surface, which is a result of dense pubescence covering the upper surface of the leaves. The flowers are typically pale pink to white, with a subtle fragrance, and bloom in late spring to early summer. It is a hybrid form of Rosa cinerascens, known for its compact growth habit and adaptability to well-drained soils. Due to its rarity and aesthetic appeal, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and specialized collections."
