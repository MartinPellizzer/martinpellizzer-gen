    "intro": "Ricinus odoratus, commonly known as the sweetleaf or sweet sycamore, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves and showy, red-purple flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces distinctive, spiny capsules that contain toxic seeds, which can be harmful if ingested. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in forested areas. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens, though caution is needed due to its poisonous properties."
