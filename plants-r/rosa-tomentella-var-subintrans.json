    "intro": "Rosa tomentella var. subintrans, commonly known as the woolly rose, is a compact shrub native to the coastal regions of California and Oregon. It is characterized by its dense, silvery-gray foliage covered in fine, soft hairs, which help protect it from salt spray and strong winds. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its growth habit is low and spreading, making it well-suited for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. The variety subintrans is distinguished by its slightly different leaf and flower morphology compared to the typical form of Rosa tomentella."
