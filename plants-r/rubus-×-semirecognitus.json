    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 semirecognitus, commonly known as the evergreen blackberry, is a hybrid shrub native to the coastal regions of California. It is characterized by its thorny stems, trifoliate leaves, and dark purple to black berries that ripen in late summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in coastal scrub and chaparral habitats. Its berries are edible, though generally tart, and are used in local culinary traditions. The species is of interest to botanists due to its hybrid origin and ecological adaptability."
