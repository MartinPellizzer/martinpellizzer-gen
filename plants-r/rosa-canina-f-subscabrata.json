    "intro": "Rosa canina f. subscabrata, commonly known as the bristly dog rose, is a botanical variant of the dog rose. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which distinguish it from the typical form of Rosa canina. The plant produces pink to reddish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by orange-red hips in autumn. It is typically found in woodland edges and scrublands across Europe. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in herbal medicine."
