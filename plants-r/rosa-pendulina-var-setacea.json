    "intro": "Rosa pendulina var. setacea, commonly known as the hairy climbing rose, is a cultivar characterized by its long, trailing stems and profuse blooms. It features soft, fuzzy foliage that gives it a unique texture, and its flowers are typically pink to red in color. This variety thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it suitable for trellises or as a ground cover. It is relatively low maintenance but benefits from regular pruning to encourage bushier growth. The plant is prized for its ornamental value and ability to add a cascading effect to gardens."
