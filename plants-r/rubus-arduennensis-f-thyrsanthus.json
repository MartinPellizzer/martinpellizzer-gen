    "intro": "Rubus arduennensis f. thyrsanthus, commonly known as the thyrsothous raspberry, is a rare botanical variant of the raspberry genus Rubus. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and unique inflorescence structure, featuring dense, thyrsothous clusters of flowers. The plant typically produces small, aggregate fruits that are often red or yellow in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate regions with rich, well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a botanical curiosity and of interest to horticulturists and botanists."
