    "intro": "Roulinia pitcairniifolia, commonly known as the Pitcairn Island lily, is a flowering plant native to the Pitcairn Islands in the South Pacific. It is a member of the Araceae family, characterized by its striking, showy inflorescence consisting of a spadix surrounded by a spathe. The plant typically grows in coastal areas, thriving in humid, saline conditions. Its leaves are broad and arrow-shaped, often with a waxy surface to reduce water loss. Due to its limited distribution and habitat vulnerability, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
