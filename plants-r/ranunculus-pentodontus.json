    "intro": "Ranunculus pentodontus, commonly known as the five-toothed buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a basal rosette of heart-shaped, glossy leaves with five distinct lobes, giving it its common name. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with five sepals and numerous stamens, typical of the Ranunculaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
