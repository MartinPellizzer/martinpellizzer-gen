    "intro": "Rytigynia pauciflora, commonly known as the few-flowered rytigynia, is a tropical shrub native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the family Rutaceae, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters. It is often found in moist, shaded habitats within tropical rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and less-studied species."
