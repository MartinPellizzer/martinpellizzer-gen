    "intro": "Rubus pedemontanus, commonly known as the Pedemontan blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves, typical of the Rubus genus. The plant produces small, dark purple berries that are edible and often used in local culinary traditions. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and partial shade. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical studies."
