    "intro": "Rhododendron jasminiflorum var. copelandii, commonly known as the Copeland's jasminiflorum rhododendron, is a deciduous shrub native to China. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are dark green and glossy. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. These flowers are often described as having a jasmine-like scent, which gives the species its common name. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens."
