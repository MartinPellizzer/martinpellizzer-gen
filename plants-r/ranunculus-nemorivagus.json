    "intro": "Ranunculus nemorivagus, commonly known as the wood anemone, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and thrives in well-drained, loamy soils. The plant features a basal rosette of heart-shaped leaves and produces showy, white or pale yellow flowers with five petals. Its flowers bloom in early spring, often before the canopy of the forest is fully developed. The plant is characterized by its delicate appearance and is often found in association with other woodland flora."
