    "intro": "Ranunculus lappaceus var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy water crowfoot, is a perennial aquatic plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in shallow freshwater habitats such as ponds, streams, and wet meadows. The plant features finely divided, feather-like leaves that float on the water surface, supported by slender, branching stems. Its flowers are usually yellow or white, with five petals and numerous stamens, blooming from late spring to early summer. The variety 'pubescens' is distinguished by its hairy or pubescent surfaces on the leaves and stems, contributing to its unique appearance."
