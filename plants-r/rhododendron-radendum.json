    "intro": "Rhododendron radendum, commonly known as the purple-leaved rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its striking violet foliage and clusters of bell-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in acidic, well-drained soils and thrives in shaded to semi-shaded environments. Its leaves are leathery and have a distinctive deep purple hue, which becomes more pronounced in cooler climates. Rhododendron radendum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to add vibrant color to woodland gardens."
