    "intro": "Ricinus obermannii, commonly known as the Obermann's castor, is a rare and ornamental species native to South Africa. It is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces unique, spiny capsules that contain toxic seeds, similar to other members of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping in arid environments. Due to its rarity and specific care requirements, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by experienced growers."
