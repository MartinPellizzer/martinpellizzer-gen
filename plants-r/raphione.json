    "intro": "Raphione, commonly known as the blue-eyed grass, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Xanthorrhoeaceae. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers that resemble those of the iris, though it is not related to the true iris. The plants typically have narrow, grass-like leaves and produce small, clustered inflorescences. Raphione species are often found in moist, sandy soils in temperate regions. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in gardens."
