    "intro": "Rumex \u00d7 xenogenus, commonly known as the hybrid sorrel, is a naturally occurring hybrid between Rumex acetosa (common sorrel) and Rumex acetobipinatus (broad-leafed sorrel). It is characterized by its distinctive heart-shaped leaves with a reddish or purple underside, often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland edges and streambanks. Botanically, it is notable for its genetic variability and potential role in plant hybridization studies."
