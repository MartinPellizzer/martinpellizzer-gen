    "intro": "Rumex acetosella var. exauris, commonly known as sour grass, is a low-growing perennial plant belonging to the Polygonaceae family. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically reddish or purple in color, often with a waxy coating. The plant produces tiny greenish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, which are usually borne on slender stalks. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wet meadows, bogs, and along stream banks. This variant is closely related to other species of sorrel and is noted for its ability to tolerate waterlogged conditions."
