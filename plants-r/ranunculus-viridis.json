    "intro": "Ranunculus viridis, commonly known as the green water crowfoot, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers with numerous petal-like sepals and deeply lobed leaves that are often submerged in water. The plant typically grows in shallow freshwater habitats such as ponds, streams, and ditches. Its leaves are usually floating or submerged, with a waxy surface that helps repel water. Ranunculus viridis plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing food and habitat for various invertebrates and small fish."
