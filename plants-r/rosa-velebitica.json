    "intro": "Rosa velebitica, commonly known as the Velebit rose, is a rare and endemic species native to the Dalmatian region of Croatia. It is a shrub that typically grows in rocky and mountainous terrain, showcasing a hardy adaptation to its harsh environment. The plant produces fragrant, pink to white flowers during the summer months, which are followed by oval, red-orange hips. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with serrated leaflets that contribute to its ornamental appeal. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Rosa velebitica is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
