    "intro": "Rubus glaucellus var. scabiosus, commonly known as the scabious raspberry, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, upright stems and clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, red berries that are typically not edible for humans but are consumed by various wildlife species. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Its foliage is covered in fine, stiff hairs, giving it a distinctive, somewhat prickly appearance."
