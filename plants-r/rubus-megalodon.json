    "intro": "Rubus megalodon, commonly known as the giant blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its large, thorny stems and dark purple to black berries that are typically harvested in late summer. The plant produces compound leaves with serrated edges and can grow up to several meters in height. Its flowers are small, white, and clustered in dense inflorescences, typical of the Rubus genus. The berries are edible when ripe but are often too tart for widespread commercial use."
