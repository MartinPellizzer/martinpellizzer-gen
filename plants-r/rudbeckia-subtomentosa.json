It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green leaves and bright yellow to orange flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and stream banks. It produces composite flowers that consist of ray florets and disk florets, typical of the Asteraceae family. Rudbeckia subtomentosa is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological value and adaptability."
