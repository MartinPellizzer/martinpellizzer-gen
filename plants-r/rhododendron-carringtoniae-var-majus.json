    "intro": "Rhododendron carringtoniae var. majus, commonly known as the Carrington's rhododendron, is a rare and striking evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan, China. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range from pink to deep red. The plant thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and requires a cool, moist climate with partial shade. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, providing a lush backdrop to its vibrant blooms. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
