    "intro": "Rosa dumalis f. ovifera, commonly known as the ovate-leaved wild rose, is a compact shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features small, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, typically in shades of pink to white. The plant's leaves are ovate in shape, with serrated edges, and are covered in a fine layer of downy hair. Its thorny stems and dense foliage make it well adapted to rocky and arid environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and beauty."
