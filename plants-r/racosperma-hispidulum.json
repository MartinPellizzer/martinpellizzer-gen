    "intro": "Racosperma hispidulum, commonly known as the hairy racosperma, is a shrub native to Australia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant is typically found in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. It produces pods that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals. Racosperma hispidulum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil."
