It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and other grass-like plants. The plant typically grows in marshy areas, shallow water, or along the edges of ponds and lakes. Its slender, grass-like stems are often covered with small, spike-like clusters of flowers. Rhynchospora recognita is characterized by its narrow leaves and its ability to thrive in moist, nutrient-poor soils."
