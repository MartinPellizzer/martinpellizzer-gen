    "intro": "Rumex roseus f. lacerus, commonly known as the fringed sorrel, is a variant of the common sorrel species. It is characterized by its distinctive, deeply lobed leaves that have a frayed or lacerated appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors or along stream banks. Its leaves are edible but contain oxalic acid, which can be toxic in large quantities. The flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually greenish-white in color, and appear in clusters."
