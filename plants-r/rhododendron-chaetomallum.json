    "intro": "Rhododendron chaetomallum, commonly known as the woolly rhododendron, is a species native to the Himalayas, particularly in regions of India, Nepal, and Bhutan. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that provides insulation against cold mountain climates. The plant typically grows as an evergreen shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 6 meters. Its flowers are usually pink to reddish in color, appearing in clusters and blooming in late spring to early summer. The leaves are leathery and dark green, with a distinctive waxy coating that helps reduce water loss in high-altitude environments."
