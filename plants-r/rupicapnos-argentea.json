It is characterized by its striking silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant yellow flowers in the spring, followed by red, fleshy berries in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is often cultivated in temperate climates."
