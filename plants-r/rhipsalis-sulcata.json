    "intro": "Rhipsalis sulcata, commonly known as the zigzag cactus, is a unique epiphytic cactus native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its soft, fleshy stems that are often segmented and covered in small, waxy tubercles. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it lacks true leaves, relying on its stems for photosynthesis. Rhipsalis sulcata is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its ornamental appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
