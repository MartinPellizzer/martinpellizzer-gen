    "intro": "Ribes recurvatum, commonly known as the Rocky Mountain gooseberry, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its erect, spiny stems and alternate, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are followed by edible, tart berries that ripen in late summer. Its botanical features make it well adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. It is often found in open woods, meadows, and along streambanks."
