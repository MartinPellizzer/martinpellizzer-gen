    "intro": "Restio insignis, commonly known as the silver restio, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a member of the Restionaceae family, which includes many grass-like plants adapted to arid and coastal environments. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny white or pale blue flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sandy or rocky coastal areas. Restio insignis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal dunes."
