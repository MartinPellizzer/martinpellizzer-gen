    "intro": "Rubus koehleri var. horridicaulis, commonly known as the rough-stemmed blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and dark purple to black fruits that ripen in late summer. The leaves are typically trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the plant produces small, white flowers in clusters. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental and edible qualities, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and for local use."
