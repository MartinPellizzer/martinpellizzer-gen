    "intro": "Rotheca rupicola, commonly known as the rock thyme, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and small, fragrant, violet-blue flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has small, leathery leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss, making it well-suited for rocky and sandy soils. It is often found in crevices and on rocky outcrops, thriving in full sun. Rotheca rupicola is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
