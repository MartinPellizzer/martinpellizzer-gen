    "intro": "Ricinocarpos, commonly known as the \"poison ivy of the ocean,\" is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its woody stems and alternate, ovate leaves that often have a waxy texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that contain toxic compounds, similar to those found in poison ivy. Ricinocarpos is primarily found in coastal regions and is adapted to saline environments."
