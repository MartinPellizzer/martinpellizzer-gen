    "intro": "Rosa eglanteria var. sepium, commonly known as the dog rose, is a species of flowering plant in the rose family. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces oval, red-brown hips that contain seeds, and its leaves are compound with five to seven leaflets. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it is often found in hedgerows and woodland edges. It has historical uses in herbal medicine and as a source of rose hips for culinary purposes."
