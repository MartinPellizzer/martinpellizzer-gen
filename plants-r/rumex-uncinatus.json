It features upright, branched stems that are often tinged with red, and its leaves are heart-shaped with a serrated edge. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its leaves contain oxalic acid, which can be toxic in large quantities, and it is often found in moist, disturbed soils. Rumex uncinatus is a member of the Polygonaceae family, which includes other sorrel species."
