    "intro": "Rhynchostemon glutinosus, commonly known as the sticky rhynchostemon, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves that exude a sticky sap, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters. Its botanical features include opposite leaves and a branching structure that supports its growth in moist, shaded environments. Rhynchostemon glutinosus is often found in forest understories and is valued for its ornamental appeal and potential medicinal properties."
