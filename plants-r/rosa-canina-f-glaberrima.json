    "intro": "Rosa canina f. glaberrima, commonly known as the glabrous dog rose, is a botanical variant of the common dog rose. It is characterized by its smooth, hairless stems and leaves, distinguishing it from the typical form of Rosa canina. This subspecies is native to parts of Europe and western Asia, where it thrives in open, sunny habitats. The flowers are usually pink or white, with five petals, and produce aggregate fruits known as rosehips. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in traditional medicine."
