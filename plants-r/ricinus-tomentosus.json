    "intro": "Ricinus tomentosus, commonly known as the hairy castor oil plant, is a species native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces distinctive spiny capsules that contain toxic, oil-rich seeds. Its botanical features make it a striking ornamental plant, though caution is needed due to the toxicity of its parts. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
