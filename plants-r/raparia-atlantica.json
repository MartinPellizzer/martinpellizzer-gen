    "intro": "Raparia atlantica, commonly known as the Atlantic rapeseed, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Atlantic Ocean. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in maritime climates with moderate temperatures and high humidity. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in coastal environments. Raparia atlantica plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
