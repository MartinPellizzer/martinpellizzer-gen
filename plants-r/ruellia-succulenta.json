It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that store water, making it drought-tolerant. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in spring and summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Ruellia succulenta is a popular choice for xeriscaping due to its ornamental value and low maintenance requirements."
