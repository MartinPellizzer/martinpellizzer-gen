    "intro": "Rosa campicola, commonly known as the mountain rose, is a species of flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is a shrub that typically grows in high-altitude environments, where it thrives in cooler and more humid conditions. The plant produces showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Rosa campicola is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
