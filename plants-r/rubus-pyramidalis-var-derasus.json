    "intro": "Rubus pyramidalis var. derasus, commonly known as the Japanese bramble, is a variant of the raspberry plant native to East Asia. It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, aggregate fruits. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the flowers are white with five petals. The berries, while edible, are generally less sweet and more tart compared to other raspberry varieties."
