    "intro": "Rubus rosifolius f. florepleno, commonly known as the double-flowered rosehip plant, is a cultivar of the Rubus genus native to China. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, red berries that are similar to those of other Rubus species but are often more compact. Its most distinctive feature is the double flowers, which have multiple layers of petals, giving it a more ornamental appearance. This variety is valued in horticulture for its unique floral display and hardy nature."
