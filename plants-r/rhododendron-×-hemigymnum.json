    "intro": "Rhododendron \u00d7 hemigymnum, commonly known as the hybrid rhododendron, is a species resulting from the cross between Rhododendron ferrugineum and Rhododendron caucasicum. It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in mountainous regions with acidic, well-drained soils, preferring cool and moist environments. Its botanical features include evergreen leaves that turn reddish in autumn and a compact growth habit that makes it suitable for rock gardens or as a specimen plant. The hybrid is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in specific ecological niches."
