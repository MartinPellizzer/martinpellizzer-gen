    "intro": "Rubus pallidus var. pannosus, commonly known as the pale raspberry or hairy raspberry, is a variant of the raspberry plant native to parts of North America. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, pale red fruits that are typically less flavorful than those of other raspberry varieties. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both horticultural study and ecological research."
