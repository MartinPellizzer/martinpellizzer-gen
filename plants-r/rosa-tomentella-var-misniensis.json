    "intro": "Rosa tomentella var. misniensis, commonly known as the Misniensis rose, is a shrub-like species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and clusters of small, fragrant pink flowers. The plant typically grows in cool, moist environments, often at elevations above 1,500 meters. Its leaves are dark green and covered in a fine, white pubescence, which helps to reduce water loss. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable climate conditions."
