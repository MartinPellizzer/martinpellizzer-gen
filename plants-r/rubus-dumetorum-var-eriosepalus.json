    "intro": "Rubus dumetorum var. eriosepalus, commonly known as the woolly blackberry, is a shrub native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and dense, woolly pubescence covering its leaves and stems. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black in color. Its leaves are palmately lobed with a serrated margin and are often covered in a fine, white to grayish down. This variety is often found in woodland edges, hedgerows, and disturbed soils, where it thrives in partial shade to full sun."
