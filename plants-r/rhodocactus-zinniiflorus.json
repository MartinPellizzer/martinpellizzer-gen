    "intro": "Rhodocactus zinniiflorus, commonly known as the Zinnia Cactus, is a unique hybrid plant that combines characteristics of both cacti and zinnias. It is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant features a succulent stem with spines and produces showy, zinnia-like flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, adding vibrant color to its native habitat. Due to its hybrid nature, it is relatively easy to grow in well-drained soil and full sun."
