    "intro": "Rhexia fasciculata, commonly known as the clustered meadowbeauty, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks, preferring moist to wet soil conditions. The plant produces showy clusters of pink to red flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and often covered in fine hairs. Rhexia fasciculata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in wetland ecosystems."
