    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus subsp. haesselbyholmiensis, commonly known as the Hesselby holm ranunculus, is a member of the Ranunculaceae family. It is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its finely divided, trifoliate leaves and showy yellow flowers with prominent white veins. Native to specific regions in Europe, it thrives in moist, calcareous soils, often found in wet meadows and riverbanks. The subspecies is distinguished by its unique leaf morphology and floral structure compared to other ranunculus species. Its ecological importance lies in its role as a food source for various pollinators and its contribution to biodiversity in its native habitats."
