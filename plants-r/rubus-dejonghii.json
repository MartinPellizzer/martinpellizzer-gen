    "intro": "Rubus dejonghii, commonly known as the De Jongh's blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and produces small, dark purple to black berries. The plant features compound leaves with serrated edges and thorn-tipped stems, typical of many Rubus species. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. The berries are edible and have a tart flavor, making them a potential candidate for local culinary use."
