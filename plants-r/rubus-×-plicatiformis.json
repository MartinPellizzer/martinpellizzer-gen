    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 plicatiformis, commonly known as the blackberry raspberry, is a hybrid plant that results from the cross between a blackberry (Rubus fruticosus) and a raspberry (Rubus idaeus). It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves, typical of the Rubus genus. The plant produces aggregate fruits that are typically dark red to black in color, with a distinctive tart flavor. It thrives in temperate climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits a mix of traits from both parent species, making it a unique subject of botanical study."
