    "intro": "Rhytidophyllum grandiflorum var. nuecense, commonly known as the Nueces rhytidophyllum, is a rare flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Texas. It is characterized by its woody stems and broad, leathery leaves that are adapted to withstand salty air and coastal winds. The plant produces striking white to pale pink flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained sandy soils and requires full sun exposure. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species and is protected in its native range."
