    "intro": "Rosa borckhausenii var. tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly rose, is a shrub-like plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, fuzzy grayish-white hairs covering the stems and leaves, giving it a distinctive, woolly appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink to red, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are compound, consisting of multiple oval-shaped leaflets, and the plant is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its unique texture and bloom. Rosa borckhausenii var. tomentosa is relatively drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils."
