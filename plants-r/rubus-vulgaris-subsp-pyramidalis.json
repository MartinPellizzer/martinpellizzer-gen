    "intro": "Rubus vulgaris subsp. pyramidalis, commonly known as the brambles or blackberry bush, is a shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces aggregate fruits, known as berries, which are typically dark purple to black in color. These berries are edible, though the plant is often considered invasive in certain regions. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is commonly found in hedgerows and woodland edges."
