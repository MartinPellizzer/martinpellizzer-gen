    "intro": "Rhododendron laudandum, commonly known as the laurel rhododendron, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of China. It features broad, leathery leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, often with a glossy texture. The plant produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to red, typically blooming in late spring. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its fragrant foliage and long-lasting floral display."
