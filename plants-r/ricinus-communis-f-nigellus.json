    "intro": "Ricinus communis f. nigellus, commonly known as the black thorn or black castor, is a variant of the castor oil plant characterized by its dark, almost black foliage. This ornamental plant is native to tropical regions and thrives in warm, humid climates. Its leaves are typically large, palmately lobed, and have a striking deep green to black coloration. The plant produces distinctive spiny stems and yellowish-green flowers that develop into capsule fruits. While it is cultivated for its aesthetic appeal, it is important to note that all parts of the plant contain toxic compounds, making it potentially hazardous to humans and animals."
