It is characterized by its thorny stems and pinnately compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces fragrant, pink to white flowers in clusters during the summer months. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has been used in traditional medicine. However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread aggressively."
