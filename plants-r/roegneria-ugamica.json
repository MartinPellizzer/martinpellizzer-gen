    "intro": "Roegneria ugamica, commonly known as the Tibetan feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of Asia, particularly in Tibet and Nepal. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces delicate, feathery inflorescences that give it its common name. The plant thrives in cold, arid environments and is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it is often found in alpine meadows and on mountain slopes. Roegneria ugamica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic and ecological benefits."
