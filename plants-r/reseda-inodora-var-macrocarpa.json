    "intro": "Reseda inodora var. macrocarpa, commonly known as the large-fruited hedge mustard, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces elongated, green pods that contain several seeds, which are released when the pods dry and split open. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and along streambanks. This variety is distinguished by its larger, more elongated fruits compared to other Reseda species."
