    "intro": "Rosa canina f. perfoliolata, commonly known as the Perfoliate Dog Rose, is a botanical variant of the dog rose species. It is characterized by its distinctive perfoliate leaves, where the leaf stalks appear to pass through the stem, creating a unique appearance. This plant typically produces pink to red flowers that bloom in the summer months. The fruit, known as a hip, is orange-red and contains achenes surrounded by a fleshy outer layer. It is often found in woodland edges and open areas, thriving in well-drained soils."
