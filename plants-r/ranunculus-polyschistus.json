    "intro": "Ranunculus polyschistus, commonly known as the alpine buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features a basal rosette of dark green, hairy leaves that are deeply lobed and often covered with fine, white hairs. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with 5 to 15 petal-like sepals, which are typically arranged in a star shape. It thrives in high-altitude environments, often growing in rocky or alpine soils with poor nutrients. Ranunculus polyschistus is adapted to cold climates and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and scree slopes at elevations above 1,500 meters."
