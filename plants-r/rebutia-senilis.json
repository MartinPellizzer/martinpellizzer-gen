    "intro": "Rebutia senilis, commonly known as the old man cactus, is a compact, low-growing cactus native to Mexico. It features a short, cylindrical stem with a gray-green color and a unique, wrinkled texture. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil. Its slow growth rate makes it an ideal choice for rock gardens and container cultivation."
