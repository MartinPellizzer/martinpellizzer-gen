It features delicate, yellow flowers with five petals and a hairy stem that often grows in clusters. The plant has palmate leaves with lobes that are broader than those of the typical R. fallax, giving it a distinct appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it a notable species within the Ranunculaceae family."
