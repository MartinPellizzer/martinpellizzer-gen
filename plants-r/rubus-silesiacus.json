It is characterized by its prickly stems and compound leaves, which are typical of the Rubus genus. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black in color. It thrives in woodland edges and disturbed soils, often forming dense thickets. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and naturalized in various regions."
