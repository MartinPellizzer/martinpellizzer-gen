    "intro": "Rosa canina f. glaucina, commonly known as the whitish dog rose, is a botanical variant of the dog rose, characterized by its pale pink to white flowers. This form exhibits a more subdued coloration compared to the typical red or pink blooms of Rosa canina. The leaves are usually oval with a serrated margin, and the plant produces hip fruits that are smaller and less showy than those of the standard species. It is often found in woodland edges and open scrublands, thriving in well-drained soils. The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in herbal medicine."
