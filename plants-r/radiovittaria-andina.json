    "intro": "Radiovittaria andina, commonly known as the Andean fern, is a species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its spores are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize new areas in its native habitat. Radiovittaria andina is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings."
