    "intro": "Rosa tomentosa var. intromissa, commonly known as the woolly rose or the fuzzy pink rose, is a shrub-like plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, grayish-white pubescence covering the stems and leaves, giving it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The flowers are typically pink to reddish in color, with five to seven petals, and bloom in late spring to early summer. It produces small, oval-shaped fruits called hips, which are red when mature and contain seeds. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and hardy nature in moderate climates."
