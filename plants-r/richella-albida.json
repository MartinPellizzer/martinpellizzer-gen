    "intro": "Richella albida, commonly known as the white-flowered richella, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its delicate, white, five-petaled flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture, and it thrives in cool, moist environments. Its root system is fibrous and helps it anchor in rocky soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Richella albida is considered a vulnerable species."
