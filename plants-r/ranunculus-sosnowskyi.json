    "intro": "Ranunculus sosnowskyi, commonly known as the Sosnowsky's rocket, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to deep red, often with a contrasting central blotch. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves and is known for its rapid growth and short blooming period. It thrives in alpine environments, often growing in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species."
