    "intro": "Rhus ciliolata, commonly known as the silky acacia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by oval, woody pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or along stream banks. Rhus ciliolata is valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to provide habitat for various wildlife species."
