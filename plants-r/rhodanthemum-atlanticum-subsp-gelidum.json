    "intro": "Rhodanthemum atlanticum subsp. gelidum, commonly known as the Atlantic rock rose, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the coastal regions of northern Europe. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and silver-gray foliage, which helps it withstand harsh maritime conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink to white, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes and rocky outcrops. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with a maritime climate."
