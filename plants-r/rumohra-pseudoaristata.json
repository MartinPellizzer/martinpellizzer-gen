    "intro": "Rumohra pseudoaristata, commonly known as the Antarctic hair grass, is a low-growing, mat-forming grass species native to the cold regions of the Southern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, fibrous roots and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. This plant thrives in nutrient-poor, rocky soils and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions, including strong winds and low temperatures. Its reproductive structures consist of small, spike-like inflorescences that produce minute, wind-dispersed seeds. Rumohra pseudoaristata plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for microorganisms in its native ecosystems."
