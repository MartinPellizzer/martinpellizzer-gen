It exhibits a range of morphological variations, adapting to different soil conditions and environmental stresses. The plant's roots are often branched and can form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi. Its growth pattern is typically subterranean, with minimal above-ground biomass. Due to its adaptability, Radicula polymorpha is found in diverse habitats, from arid regions to moist forest floors."
