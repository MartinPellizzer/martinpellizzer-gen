    "intro": "Rhododendron radians var. dissilistellatum, commonly known as the pink-flowered rhododendron, is a rare and ornamental plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range from pale pink to deep rose, often with a distinctive two-lipped structure. The plant typically grows as an evergreen shrub, featuring broad, leathery leaves that provide a lush backdrop to its vibrant blooms. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and requires partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a valuable but endangered species in its native range."
