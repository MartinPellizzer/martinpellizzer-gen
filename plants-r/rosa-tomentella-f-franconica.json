    "intro": "Rosa tomentella f. franconica, commonly known as the Franconian woolly rose, is a compact, shrub-like plant native to Central Europe. It features dense, silvery-white fuzzy foliage that gives it a distinctive, soft appearance. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers in early summer, which are clustered in apical inflorescences. Its leaves are ovate to elliptical, with a hairy texture that provides protection against environmental stress. It is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and hardy nature."
