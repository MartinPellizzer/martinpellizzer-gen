    "intro": "Ritterocactus rutilans, commonly known as the golden barrel cactus, is a species native to Mexico. It is characterized by its rounded, cylindrical stem that is typically green with a waxy coating. The plant produces bright yellow flowers during the summer months, which are borne in clusters at the top of the stem. It is a slow-growing plant that thrives in well-draining soil and full sunlight. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for desert gardens and indoor cultivation."
