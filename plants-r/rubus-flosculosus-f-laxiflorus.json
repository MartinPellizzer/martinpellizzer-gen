    "intro": "Rubus flosculosus f. laxiflorus, commonly known as the looseflower raspberry, is a botanical variant of the raspberry plant characterized by its distinctive floral morphology. This form exhibits larger, more loosely arranged flowers compared to the typical species, which enhances its ornamental appeal. The plant is a shrub with thorny stems and pinnately compound leaves, typical of the Rubus genus. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, and they bloom in the spring. The fruit, like other raspberries, is aggregate, developing from multiple ovaria and containing small, seeded drupes."
