    "intro": "Rhynchospora distans var. microcarpa, commonly known as the small-fruited marsh sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow leaves. The plant produces small, three-lobed flowers arranged in spikelets, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its fruits are tiny, three-angled capsules that contain minute seeds, adapted for dispersal by water or wind. This variety is distinguished by its smaller, more compact inflorescences compared to other forms of Rhynchospora distans."
