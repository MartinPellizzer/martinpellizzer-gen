It is native to eastern North America and is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of dark purple to black berries. The plant typically grows in moist woodlands and along stream banks, preferring partial shade. Its leaves are compound, with three to five leaflets, and the flowers are white with five petals. The fruit is edible, though the plant is often considered invasive in certain regions due to its rapid spread."
