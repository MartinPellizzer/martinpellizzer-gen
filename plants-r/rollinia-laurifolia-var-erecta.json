It features glossy, dark green, lance-shaped leaves that are often aromatic. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible berries that range in color from yellow to red. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and edible fruits. The variety 'erecta' is distinguished by its upright growth habit compared to other forms of Rollinia laurifolia."
