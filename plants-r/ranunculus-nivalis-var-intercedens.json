    "intro": "Ranunculus nivalis var. intercedens, commonly known as the alpine buttercup, is a low-growing perennial herb native to alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It produces delicate, showy flowers with five to seven yellow petals and a bright yellow center, typical of the Ranunculaceae family. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in meadows, rocky slopes, and mountainous areas. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a hairy texture that helps protect it from harsh weather conditions. This variant is distinguished by its smaller stature and more compact growth compared to other ranunculus species."
