    "intro": "Ranunculus exiguidens, commonly known as the dwarf buttercup, is a small herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features delicate, palmate leaves and bright yellow flowers with numerous petal-like sepals. The plant typically grows to a height of only a few centimeters, making it a low-growing species. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
