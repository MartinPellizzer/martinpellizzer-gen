    "intro": "Ricinus chinensis, commonly known as Chinese castor oil plant, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves and distinctive spiny seed pods. The plant produces toxic, hairy seeds that contain ricin, one of the most potent natural toxins. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Despite its beauty, it requires careful handling due to its toxic properties."
