    "intro": "Rhodiola nobilis subsp. atuntsuensis, commonly known as the Transbaikal rhodiola, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its fleshy, rhizomatous root system and rosette-like arrangement of dark green, leathery leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in cold, high-altitude environments and is adapted to poor, well-drained soils. Due to its medicinal properties and rarity, it is considered a valuable but endangered species in its native habitat."
