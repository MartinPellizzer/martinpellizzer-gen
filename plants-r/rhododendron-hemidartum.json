    "intro": "Rhododendron hemidartum, commonly known as the dwarf rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of China. It is a compact shrub characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of bell-shaped, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. It prefers acidic, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, thriving in cool, humid climates. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its early spring blooming period, adding color to gardens in late winter or early spring."
