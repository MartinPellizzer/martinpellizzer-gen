    "intro": "Rhododendron moszkowskii, commonly known as the Moskowian rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia, particularly in China and Korea. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters, featuring dense, leathery leaves that are often dark green in color. The plant produces showy, clustered flowers in shades of pink to purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and requires partial to full shade for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is cultivated in gardens and botanical collections in temperate climates."
