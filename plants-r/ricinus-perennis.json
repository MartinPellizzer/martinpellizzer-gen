    "intro": "Ricinus perennis, commonly known as castor bean plant, is a flowering plant native to the eastern Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, palmate leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces distinctive spiky, crimson-colored seed pods that contain toxic seeds used in the production of castor oil. Ricinus perennis is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family and is known for its ornamental value in gardens. However, it is important to handle the plant with care due to the presence of ricin, a potent toxin in its seeds."
