    "intro": "Roegneria heterophylla, commonly known as the variable wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and long, narrow leaves that vary in shape depending on environmental conditions. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets. Roegneria heterophylla is often found in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes. Its adaptability to harsh climates makes it an important component of alpine ecosystems."
