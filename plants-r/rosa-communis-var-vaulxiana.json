    "intro": "Rosa communis var. vaulxiana, commonly known as the Vaulxian rose, is a compact, shrub-like plant native to the United Kingdom. It features fragrant, semi-double pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has dark green, glossy foliage that provides a striking contrast to its floral display. It is well-suited for small gardens or container planting due to its compact growth habit. The Vaulxian rose is prized for its ornamental value and historical significance in British horticulture."
