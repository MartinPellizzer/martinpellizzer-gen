    "intro": "Rhynchosia caribaea var. thorncroftii, commonly known as the Caribbean spurred cowpea, is a climbing legume native to the Caribbean region. It features trifoliate leaves with three oval-shaped leaflets and produces distinctive spurred flowers in shades of pink to purple. The plant is characterized by its slender, twining stems and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and clearings. It has small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, and it is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. This variant is of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptability."
