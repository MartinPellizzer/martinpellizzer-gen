    "intro": "Roella muscosa, commonly known as the rock fern, is a small, delicate fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows on rocky surfaces or in shaded, moist environments, thriving in humid climates. The plant has finely divided, feather-like fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of tiny, scale-like structures. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Roella muscosa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to adapt to challenging growing conditions."
