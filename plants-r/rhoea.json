    "intro": "Rhoea, commonly known as the fireplant or red-hot poker, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family. It is characterized by its striking, brightly colored bracts that resemble flames, which are actually modified leaves rather than flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is native to southern Africa. Rhoea species are perennial shrubs that can reach heights of up to three meters. They are often cultivated for their ornamental value and ability to thrive in sunny, well-drained conditions."
