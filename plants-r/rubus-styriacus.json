    "intro": "Rubus styriacus, commonly known as the Styrian blackberry, is a species of brambles native to central and eastern Europe. It is characterized by its thorny stems and trifoliate leaves, which are typically serrated and dark green. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that mature to a deep black color, often used in local cuisines and traditional remedies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands and along streambanks. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is cultivated in some regions for both aesthetic and practical purposes."
