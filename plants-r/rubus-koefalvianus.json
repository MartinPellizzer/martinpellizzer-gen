    "intro": "Rubus koefalvianus, commonly known as the Koefalvian blackberry, is a species of bramble native to parts of Europe. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, dark berries that are typically harvested in late summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and localized species within its native range."
