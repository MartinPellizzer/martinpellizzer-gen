    "intro": "Rhytidophyllum leucomallon var. flavicans, commonly known as the yellow-flowered tuckahoe, is a rare and striking plant native to specific regions of the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, waxy, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a unique, shrub-like growth habit with thick, leathery leaves that are often covered in a powdery coating. Its botanical features include a deep root system that helps it survive in moist, swampy habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
