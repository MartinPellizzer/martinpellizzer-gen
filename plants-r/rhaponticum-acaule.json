    "intro": "Rhaponticum acaule, commonly known as the naked stem sunflower, is a perennial herb native to the mountains of Central Asia. It is characterized by its upright, leafless stem that bears a single, large, yellow flower head at the top. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sunlight. Its flowers are composite, consisting of numerous small yellow ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular florets. Rhaponticum acaule is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has also been used in traditional medicine."
