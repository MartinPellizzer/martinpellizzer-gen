    "intro": "Rubus paludivagus, commonly known as the swamp blackberry, is a species of bramble native to wetland habitats in Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its trailing or climbing growth habit and produces small, dark berries that are often used in local cuisines. The plant has compound leaves with serrated edges and is adapted to thrive in moist, nutrient-rich soils. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland environments and providing food for various wildlife species. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
