    "intro": "Rhamnus tumetica, commonly known as the inflated buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, fleshy, berry-like fruits that remain on the plant throughout the winter. The leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or rocky areas. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study."
