    "intro": "Ranunculus geraniifolius subsp. aduncus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features delicate, palmately lobed leaves and bright yellow flowers with five petals. Its flowers are usually short-lived, opening in early spring and closing by midday. The species is characterized by its hairy stems and small, spurred sepals that distinguish it from other ranunculus species."
