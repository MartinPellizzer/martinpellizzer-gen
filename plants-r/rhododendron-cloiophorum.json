    "intro": "Rhododendron cloiophorum, commonly known as the white-flowered rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows as an evergreen shrub, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, providing a striking contrast to the pale blooms. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas with high humidity."
