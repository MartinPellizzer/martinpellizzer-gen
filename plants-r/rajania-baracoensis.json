    "intro": "Rajania baracoensis, commonly known as the Bornean Rajania, is a flowering plant native to the rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the family Araceae, which includes plants such as philodendrons and calla lilies. The plant is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and a striking inflorescence that consists of a spadix surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of moisture and nutrient-rich soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
