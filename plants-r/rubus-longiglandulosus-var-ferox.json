    "intro": "Rubus longiglandulosus var. ferox, commonly known as the long-haired blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, glandular hairs that cover its stems, leaves, and fruit, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically tart and less palatable than common blackberries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forests and along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and potential use in horticulture."
