    "intro": "Rhododendron rugosum var. rugosum, commonly known as the roughleaf rhododendron, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of China. It features dark green, leathery leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, glandular hairs, giving them a rough texture. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, pink to purple flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Its ornamental value lies in its attractive foliage and showy blooms, making it a popular choice for gardens in suitable climates."
