    "intro": "Rubus idaeus laevigatus, commonly known as the smooth raspberry, is a species of brambles native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its trailing or climbing growth habit, with thorny stems and alternate, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces aggregate fruits, known as raspberries, which are typically red when ripe and contain numerous small drupelets. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a common sight in hedgerows and woodland edges. The smooth raspberry is valued for its edible fruits and is often cultivated for both ornamental and culinary purposes."
