    "intro": "Ramonda myconi, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, fuzzy texture, while its stems are often hairy. Ramonda myconi is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural alpine environment."
