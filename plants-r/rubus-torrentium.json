    "intro": "Rubus torrentium, commonly known as the alpine blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its trailing or climbing growth habit, with slender, hairy stems that often grow along rocky or stream-side terrain. The plant produces small, dark red to black berries that are typically clustered at the ends of its thorny stems. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges and a slightly hairy surface. Rubus torrentium is adapted to cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and riverbanks."
