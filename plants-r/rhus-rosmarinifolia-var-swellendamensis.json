    "intro": "Rhus rosmarinifolia var. swellendamensis, commonly known as the Swellendam hakea, is a shrub native to South Africa. It features small, narrow leaves that are often aromatic and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers, which are followed by spiny, berry-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its botanical characteristics make it an interesting subject for study in plant morphology and adaptation."
