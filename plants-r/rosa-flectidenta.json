    "intro": "Rosa flectidenta, commonly known as the wavy-toothed rose, is a rare and lesser-known species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive, serrated leaf margins that curve inward, giving it a unique appearance. The plant produces fragrant pink to white flowers in late spring, which are typically clustered in small groups. Native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, it thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Rosa flectidenta is considered a rare and endangered species."
