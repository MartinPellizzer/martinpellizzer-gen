    "intro": "Rubus hirtus var. tenuidentatus, commonly known as the slender-leaved bramble, is a shrub native to parts of eastern North America. It is characterized by its hairy stems and slender, serrated leaves with a distinctive, slightly pointed tip. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits known as drupes, which are typically red or black when mature. It thrives in moist, wooded areas and is often found in the understory of deciduous forests. Due to its hardy nature, it is a common species in wetland and riparian habitats."
