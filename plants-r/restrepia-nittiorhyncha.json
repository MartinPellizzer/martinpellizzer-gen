    "intro": "Restrepia nittiorhyncha, commonly known as the pink-stemmed bromeliad, is a species of flowering plant in the Bromeliaceae family. It is native to the high-altitude cloud forests of Ecuador and is characterized by its vibrant, showy inflorescences. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and absorbing moisture from the air. Its leaves form a rosette that collects rainwater, providing a habitat for small organisms. The flowers are usually pink or red, adding to its ornamental value in cultivation."
