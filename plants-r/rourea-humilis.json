It features opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are usually glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by spherical, fleshy fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its compact size and ornamental foliage, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in shaded garden settings."
