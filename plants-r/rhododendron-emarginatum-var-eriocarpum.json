It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive, fluffy appearance. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to purple, typically blooming in late spring. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in rocky or forested areas at high elevations. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation efforts."
