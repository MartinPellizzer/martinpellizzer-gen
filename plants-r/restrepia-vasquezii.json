    "intro": "Restrepia vasquezii, commonly known as the V\u00e1squez's restrepia, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the Andean regions of Ecuador. It is a small, terrestrial orchid with a short, stocky rhizome and a single, narrow leaf. The plant produces a single, slender stem that bears a few small, greenish-white flowers with a distinctive yellow lip. It thrives in humid, shaded environments at high altitudes, often in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
