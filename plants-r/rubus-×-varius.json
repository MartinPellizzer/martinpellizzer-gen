    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 varius, commonly known as the hybrid blackberry raspberry, is a deciduous shrub belonging to the Rosaceae family. It is a natural hybrid between Rubus ursinus (blackberry) and Rubus idaeus (raspberry), resulting in a plant that exhibits characteristics of both parents. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or black in color, with a tart flavor. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges or disturbed soils. Due to its hybrid nature, it can show genetic variability in growth habits and fruit quality."
