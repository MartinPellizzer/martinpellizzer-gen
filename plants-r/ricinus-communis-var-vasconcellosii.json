    "intro": "Ricinus communis var. vasconcellosii, commonly known as the Vasconcellosii castor bean, is a variant of the castor oil plant. It is native to South America and is characterized by its large, palmate leaves and distinctive spiny seed capsules. The plant produces toxic seeds that contain ricin, a potent toxin, making it hazardous if ingested. It thrives in warm, tropical climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Despite its beauty, it requires careful handling due to its toxic properties."
