It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical inflorescence that resembles a bottlebrush, composed of numerous spikelets. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and linear, with a distinctive blue-gray sheen, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in native landscapes."
