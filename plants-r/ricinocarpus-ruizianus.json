    "intro": "Ricinocarpus ruizianus, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rhizophoraceae. It is characterized by its prop roots that extend into the water, providing structural support in tidal environments. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. Its fruit is a drupe that contains a single seed, and it plays an important role in coastal ecosystems. Ricinocarpus ruizianus is adapted to saline and brackish water conditions, making it a key component of mangrove forests."
