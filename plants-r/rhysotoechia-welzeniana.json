    "intro": "Rhysotoechia welzeniana, commonly known as the Welzen's rhysotoechia, is a rare and little-known plant species belonging to the family Acanthaceae. It is native to specific regions in Southeast Asia, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments within tropical forests. The plant is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to violet, often with contrasting markings. Its leaves are typically ovate and have a smooth, waxy surface, which helps in reducing water loss in its humid habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Rhysotoechia welzeniana is considered a species of conservation concern."
