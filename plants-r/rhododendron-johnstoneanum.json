    "intro": "Rhododendron johnstoneanum, commonly known as the Johnstone's rhododendron, is a species native to the Himalayas, particularly in regions of India and Nepal. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of pink to white. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments at high altitudes, often in mountainous forests. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, providing a striking contrast to its vibrant floral displays. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with specific soil and climate conditions."
