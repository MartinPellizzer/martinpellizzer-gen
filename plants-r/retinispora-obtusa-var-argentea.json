    "intro": "Retinispora obtusa var. argentea, commonly known as silverleaf retinispora, is a deciduous shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of silvery-white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens for its striking foliage and unique growth habit."
