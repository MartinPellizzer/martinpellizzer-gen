    "intro": "Rhododendron pudorosum, commonly known as the shy rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Asia, particularly in China and Nepal. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, preferring acidic soils rich in organic matter. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, providing a striking contrast to the pink or white blossoms. Rhododendron pudorosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
