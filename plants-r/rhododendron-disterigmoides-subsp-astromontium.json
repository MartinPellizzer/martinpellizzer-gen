    "intro": "[WRONG START] Rhododendron disterroides subsp. astromontium, commonly known as the Astromontium rhododendron, is a species native to the Himalayas, particularly in regions of India and Nepal. It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its upright growth habit and dense foliage. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in early spring. Its leaves are leathery and elliptical, with a waxy surface that helps it retain moisture in its mountainous habitat. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens with well-drained, acidic soil."
