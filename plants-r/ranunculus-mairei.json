    "intro": "Ranunculus mairei, commonly known as the Maire's buttercup, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its delicate, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three deeply lobed leaflets, and it produces small, hairy seed pods that burst open to disperse seeds. Ranunculus mairei is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for native insects."
