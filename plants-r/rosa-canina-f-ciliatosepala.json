    "intro": "Rosa canina f. ciliatosepala, commonly known as the hairy-sepal dog rose, is a botanical variant of the common dog rose. It is characterized by its hairy sepals, which distinguish it from the typical form of Rosa canina. The plant produces fragrant pink or white flowers that bloom in the spring. Its foliage consists of pinnately compound leaves with serrated edges. The fruit, a red hip, is edible and contains seeds, making it valuable for both ornamental and ecological purposes."
