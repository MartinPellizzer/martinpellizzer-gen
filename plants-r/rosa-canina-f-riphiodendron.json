    "intro": "Rosa canina f. riphiodendron, commonly known as the bristly dog rose, is a botanical variant of the common dog rose. It is characterized by its dense, bristly hairs on the stems and leaves, which give it a distinct appearance. The plant produces fragrant, pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fruits, known as hips, are orange-red, hairy, and contain a high concentration of vitamin C. This subspecies is often found in hedgerows and woodland edges across Europe."
