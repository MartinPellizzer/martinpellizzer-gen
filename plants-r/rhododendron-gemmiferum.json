    "intro": "Rhododendron gemmiferum, commonly known as the gemmiferum rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of China. It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its dense, broad leaves and clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and requires partial to full shade for optimal growth. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its vibrant floral display, which can range from pink to deep red. Rhododendron gemmiferum is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil in rocky or eroded areas."
