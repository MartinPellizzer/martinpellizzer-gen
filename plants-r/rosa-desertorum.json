    "intro": "Rosa desertorum, commonly known as the desert rose, is a perennial shrub native to arid regions of North America. It features woody stems with thorny branches and produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of pink, red, and white. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hair, aiding in water retention. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Rosa desertorum is well adapted to harsh desert conditions, making it a resilient and ornamental plant in xeriscaping."
