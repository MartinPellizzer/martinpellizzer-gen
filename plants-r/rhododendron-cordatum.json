    "intro": "Rhododendron cordatum, commonly known as the heartleaf rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Rhododendron cordatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in gardens and botanical collections for its aesthetic and ecological benefits."
