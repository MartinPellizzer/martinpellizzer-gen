    "intro": "Rosa gallicoacharii, commonly known as the Gallican rose, is a rare and endangered species native to the mountainous regions of southern France. It is characterized by its small, fragrant pink flowers and dense, thorny stems. The plant thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and requires a cool, moist climate. Its leaves are pinnate, with five to seven leaflets, and it produces red hips that contain seeds. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, conservation efforts are essential to preserve this unique botanical species."
