    "intro": "Rosa rhaetica var. schulzeana, commonly known as the Rhaetian rose, is a rare and ancient species native to the Alps. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense, dark green foliage. The plant produces fragrant, semi-double pink flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is typically found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
