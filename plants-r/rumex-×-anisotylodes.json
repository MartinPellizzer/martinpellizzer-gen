    "intro": "Rumex \u00d7 anisotylodes, commonly known as the broad-leaved dock, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Rumex acetosa and Rumex obtusifolius. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that are arranged in a loose spike. It is often found in disturbed soils along roadsides, fields, and waste areas. Its botanical features make it a common weed in agricultural and urban environments."
