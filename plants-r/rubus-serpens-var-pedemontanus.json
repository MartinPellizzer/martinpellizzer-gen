    "intro": "Rubus serpens var. pedemontanus, commonly known as the Alpine blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is a deciduous shrub that produces small, dark berries, which are typically harvested in late summer. The plant has thorny stems and trifoliate leaves, typical of the Rubus genus. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical studies."
