    "intro": "Rubus schleicheri var. fragaroides, commonly known as the fragrant raspberry. This variant is characterized by its trailing growth habit and thornless stems, making it suitable for ground cover. The leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red when mature. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and mild flavor, though it is less commonly cultivated than other raspberry species."
