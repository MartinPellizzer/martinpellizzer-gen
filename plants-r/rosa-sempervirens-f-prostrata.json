It features dense, mat-forming growth with small, glossy, dark green leaves. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, semi-double pink flowers in spring and summer. It is well-suited for rock gardens, borders, or as ground cover due to its compact habit. Its botanical characteristics make it a hardy and ornamental choice for gardeners seeking a resilient, flowering plant."
