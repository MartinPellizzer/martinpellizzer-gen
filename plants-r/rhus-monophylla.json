    "intro": "Rhus monophylla, commonly known as the desert buckthorn, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are followed by small, red berries that are edible for some wildlife. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along canyon walls. Rhus monophylla plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert animals."
