    "intro": "Ruellia prostrata var. dejecta, commonly known as the prostrate ruellia, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its low-growing, spreading habit with soft, hairy stems and opposite leaves that are typically lance-shaped. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of blue, purple, or white, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for ornamental use in gardens. Its compact growth form makes it suitable for ground cover or as a filler in container plantings."
