It is a shrub characterized by its thorny stems and small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in spring. The leaves are pinnately compound, consisting of five to seven oval leaflets with serrated edges. Its fruits, known as hips, are red, hairy, and contain seeds, often used in traditional medicine. This plant thrives in well-drained soil and is often found in hedgerows and woodland edges."
