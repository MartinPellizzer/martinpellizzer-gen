    "intro": "Rhamnus californica subsp. typica, commonly known as the California coffeeberry, is a deciduous shrub native to coastal regions of California. It is characterized by its small, dark red berries that resemble coffee beans, hence its common name. The plant has simple, ovate leaves with smooth margins and is typically found in moist, well-drained soils. It produces yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are followed by the edible, though tart, berries. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
