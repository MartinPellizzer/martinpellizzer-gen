    "intro": "Rhamnus frangula var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and alternate, simple, ovate leaves that are often broader than those of the typical Rhamnus frangula. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by dark blue, fleshy berries that are an important food source for birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain regions."
