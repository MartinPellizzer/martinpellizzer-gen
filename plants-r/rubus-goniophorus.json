    "intro": "Rubus goniophorus, commonly known as the mountain blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the highlands of South America. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and thorny stems, which help it to climb and spread across rocky terrain. The plant produces small, dark berries that are typically clustered at the ends of its stems. These berries are edible and have a tart flavor, making them a food source for various wildlife species. Botanically, it belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is closely related to other bramble species found in similar habitats."
