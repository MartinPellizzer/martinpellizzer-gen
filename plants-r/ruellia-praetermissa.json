    "intro": "Ruellia praetermissa, commonly known as the slender ruellia, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are usually blue or purple in color, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a smooth texture, often with a slight waxy coating. Ruellia praetermissa is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partial shade."
