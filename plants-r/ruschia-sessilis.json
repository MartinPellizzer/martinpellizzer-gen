    "intro": "Ruschia sessilis, commonly known as the fat-tailed ice plant, is a succulent native to South Africa. It features fleshy, thick leaves that store water, adapted to arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, typically during the spring and summer months. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Its compact growth habit and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice for drought-tolerant landscaping."
