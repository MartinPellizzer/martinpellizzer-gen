    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 erythrandrus, commonly known as the red-berried blackberry. It is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Rubus ursinus (the American blackberry) and Rubus idaeus (the common raspberry). This species is characterized by its dark red to black berries, which are typically smaller than those of pure species. The plant produces compound leaves with serrated edges and has thorny stems typical of the Rubus genus. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its flavorful fruits."
