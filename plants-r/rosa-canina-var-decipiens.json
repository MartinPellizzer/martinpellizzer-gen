    "intro": "Rosa canina var. decipiens, commonly known as the deceptive dog rose, is a variant of the common dog rose. It is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia, characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fruit, a red hip, is similar in appearance to that of the common dog rose but is often less showy. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in herbal medicine."
