    "intro": "Ridleyandra merohmerea, commonly known as the New Zealand rock daisy, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, often in clusters at the ends of its stems. Ridleyandra merohmerea thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is typically found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
