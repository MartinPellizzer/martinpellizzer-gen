    "intro": "Rumex roseus var. integer, commonly known as the smooth dock, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features upright, slender stems that are typically hairless, and its leaves are alternate, lanceolate, and often have a waxy coating. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in dense clusters during the spring and summer months. Its root system is fibrous and can spread extensively, making it a persistent weed in cultivated areas. The leaves and stems are sometimes used in traditional medicine for their purported astringent properties."
