    "intro": "Ranunculus sotkamoensis, commonly known as the Sotkamo buttercup, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Finland. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family, characterized by its showy, often yellow or white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its leaves are palmately divided, and it produces small, cup-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and is protected in its native range."
