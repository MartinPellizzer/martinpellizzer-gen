    "intro": "Rhamnus \u00d7 hybrida, commonly known as the hybrid buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree that exhibits a mix of characteristics from its parent species, Rhamnus cathartica and Rhamnus alnifolia. It typically grows to a height of 3\u20136 meters, featuring dark green, oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by black, berry-like fruits that are an important food source for birds. Rhamnus \u00d7 hybrida is native to Europe and is often found in woodland edges, hedgerows, and disturbed soils. Its adaptability and ornamental qualities make it a popular choice in landscaping, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
