    "intro": "Richetia angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf richetia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. The plant has slender, upright stems with small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are small and clustered in terminal spikes, producing pale yellow to greenish blooms. Richetia angustifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in arid gardens for its drought tolerance."
