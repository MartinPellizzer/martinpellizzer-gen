    "intro": "Rubus chlorocaulon, commonly known as the green-stemmed blackberry. It is a species of bramble native to eastern North America, characterized by its slender, greenish stems and small, dark purple fruits. The plant typically grows in moist woodlands and thickets, preferring partial shade. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges and a slightly hairy texture. The berries, though not as widely cultivated as other blackberry varieties, are edible and have a tart flavor."
