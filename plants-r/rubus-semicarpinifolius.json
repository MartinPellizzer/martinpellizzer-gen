    "intro": "Rubus semicarpinifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaved blackberry, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with narrow, serrated leaflets. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that ripen to a dark purple or black color, typically in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and for local consumption."
