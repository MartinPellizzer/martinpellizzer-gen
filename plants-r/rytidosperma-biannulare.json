    "intro": "Rytidosperma biannulare, commonly known as the two-annual grass, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the grass family, Poaceae, and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is typically found in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Rytidosperma biannulare is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil."
