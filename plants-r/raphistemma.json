    "intro": "Raphistemma, commonly known as the \"ghost orchid,\" is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance with elongated leaves and small, pale flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Raphistemma thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of dense forests. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is highly valued in botanical conservation efforts."
