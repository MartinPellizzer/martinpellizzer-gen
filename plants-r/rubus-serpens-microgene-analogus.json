It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and small, trifoliate leaves. The plant produces aggregate fruits composed of tiny, red drupes that are typically eaten by birds and small mammals. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
