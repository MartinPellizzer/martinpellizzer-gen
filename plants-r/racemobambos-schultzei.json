    "intro": "Racemobambos schultzei, commonly known as the Schultze's bamboo, is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is native to parts of Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that grow in dense clumps, forming a bamboo-like structure. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are long and narrow, with a smooth surface and a slight waxy coating. Racemobambos schultzei is often used in ornamental horticulture for its aesthetic appeal and hardy nature."
