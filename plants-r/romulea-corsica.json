    "intro": "Romulea corsica, commonly known as the Corsican squill, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Corsica. It belongs to the family Asparagaceae and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of bell-shaped flowers. The plant produces white or pale blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its bulbs are adapted to store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. Romulea corsica is often found in rocky soils and open habitats, making it a hardy and resilient species."
