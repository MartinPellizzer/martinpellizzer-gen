    "intro": "Rubus milliformis var. simulatus, commonly known as the mimic raspberry, is a variant of the raspberry plant native to certain regions of North America. It is characterized by its prickly stems and aggregate fruits, which resemble those of other Rubus species. The leaves are typically trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the plant produces small, yellowish flowers in the spring. This variety is often found in moist, wooded areas and thrives in partial shade. Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and a subject of interest for botanists studying plant morphology."
