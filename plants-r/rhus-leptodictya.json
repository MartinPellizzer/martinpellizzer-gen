    "intro": "Rhus leptodictya, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sumac, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are divided into narrow, elongated leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds and some mammals. Rhus leptodictya thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed sites. Its botanical features make it an important component of local ecosystems and a subject of interest in botanical studies."
