    "intro": "Roupala barnettiae, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a small evergreen tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring. The tree has a slow growth rate and is known for its hard, heavy wood, which is highly valued for construction and furniture-making. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and inland forested areas. Due to its ecological importance and limited natural range, it is also considered a vulnerable species."
