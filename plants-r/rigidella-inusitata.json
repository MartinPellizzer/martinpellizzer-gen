    "intro": "Rigidella inusitata, commonly known as the rigid false flax, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its erect, sparsely branched stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fibrous roots and tough, fibrous stems make it adaptable to dry, disturbed soils. Rigidella inusitata is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes."
