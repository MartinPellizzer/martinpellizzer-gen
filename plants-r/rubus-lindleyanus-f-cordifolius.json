    "intro": "Rubus lindleyanus f. cordifolius, commonly known as the heart-leaved blackberry, is a horticultural form of the blackberry plant characterized by its distinctive heart-shaped leaves. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is native to regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically smaller than those of typical blackberry varieties. It is valued for its ornamental foliage and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal. The leaves are a notable feature, with a broad, cordate shape that sets it apart from other Rubus species."
