    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 variegatus, commonly known as the variegated blackberry, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Rubus ursinus (the evergreen blackberry) and Rubus chamaemorus (the cloudberry). It is characterized by its distinctive variegated foliage, which features a mix of green, white, and gold colors. The plant produces small, tart berries that are typically harvested in late summer. It thrives in temperate climates and prefers moist, well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value and unique fruit, it is often cultivated in gardens and for small-scale fruit production."
