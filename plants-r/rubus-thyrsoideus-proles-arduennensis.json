    "intro": "Rubus thyrsoideus proles arduennensis, commonly known as the Arduenna thornberry, is a rare shrub native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces white to pale pink flowers in the spring, followed by red, edible berries in the summer. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or forested habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
