    "intro": "Rubus leucanthemus, commonly known as the white-flowered blackberry, is a species of bramble native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves, typical of the Rubus genus. The plant produces small, white flowers that are often clustered together, followed by edible blackberry-like fruits. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, fertile ground. This shrub is often found in woodland edges and disturbed areas, where it plays a role in local ecosystems."
