It is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant has dark green, slightly hairy leaves that are adapted to withstand salt spray and wind. Its stems are covered in thorns, which provide protection from herbivores. This variety is often found in brackish wetlands and is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils."
