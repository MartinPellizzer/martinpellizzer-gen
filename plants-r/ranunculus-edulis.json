    "intro": "Ranunculus edulis, commonly known as the edible buttercup, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its bright yellow, cup-shaped flowers and trifoliate leaves. The plant grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and establish itself in suitable habitats. However, it contains toxic compounds, so it must be prepared carefully before consumption."
