    "intro": "Ricinus digitatus, commonly known as the fingerleaf castor, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves that resemble fingers, giving it its common name. The plant produces distinctive yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by spiny capsules containing toxic seeds. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its striking foliage. However, it should be handled with care as all parts of the plant are toxic to humans and animals."
