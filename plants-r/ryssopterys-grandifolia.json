    "intro": "Ryssopterys grandifolia, commonly known as the giant fern, is a striking plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant features a rhizomatous growth habit, with dense, fibrous roots that help anchor it in moist, shaded environments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds, and they play a key role in its reproductive cycle. Ryssopterys grandifolia thrives in humid climates and is often found in forest understories where it can receive adequate indirect sunlight."
