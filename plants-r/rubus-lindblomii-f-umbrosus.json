    "intro": "Rubus lindblomii f. umbrosus, commonly known as the shadow raspberry, is a rare and lesser-known variant of the Rubus genus. It is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves and small, edible berries that ripen to a deep red. This plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically found in temperate forests. Its flowers are usually pale pink or white, adding a delicate touch to its foliage. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
