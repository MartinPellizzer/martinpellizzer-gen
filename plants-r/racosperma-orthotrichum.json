    "intro": "Racosperma orthotrichum, commonly known as the narrow-leafed acacia, is a shrub native to Australia. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pod-like fruits. The plant has slender, often spiny stems and produces yellow flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are typically narrow and have a leathery texture, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Racosperma orthotrichum is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is well-suited to semi-arid climates."
