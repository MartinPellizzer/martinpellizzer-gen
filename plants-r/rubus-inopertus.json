    "intro": "Rubus inopertus, commonly known as the alpine blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically harvested in late summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitats."
