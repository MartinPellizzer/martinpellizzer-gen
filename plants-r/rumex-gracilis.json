    "intro": "Rumex gracilis, commonly known as slender dock, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in wet meadows, stream banks, and marshy areas. The plant has alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, greenish flowers in a dense, terminal cluster. Its rhubarb-like leaves are edible but contain oxalic acid, so they should be cooked before consumption. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
