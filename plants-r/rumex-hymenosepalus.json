It belongs to the Polygonaceae family, which includes other familiar plants like buckwheat and sorrel. The plant features alternate, heart-shaped leaves with a smooth margin, and it produces small, greenish flowers in clusters. It thrives in moist, wooded areas and is often found in shaded or partially shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its edible leaves, which have a tangy, sour flavor due to the presence of oxalic acid."
