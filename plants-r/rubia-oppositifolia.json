    "intro": "Rubia oppositifolia, commonly known as the opposite-leaved madder, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes many flowering plants known for their medicinal and dye-producing properties. The plant is characterized by its opposite arrangement of lance-shaped leaves and produces small, white or pale yellow flowers. Its roots contain a red dye called rubia, which has been historically used for coloring textiles. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in woodland areas."
