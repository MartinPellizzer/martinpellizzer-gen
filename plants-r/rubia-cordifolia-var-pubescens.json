    "intro": "Rubia cordifolia var. pubescens, commonly known as hairy heartleaf rubia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically blue to purple in color, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its roots are rich in anthraquinones and have been historically used in traditional medicine. This variant is often found in woodland edges and shaded moist soils, where it thrives in partial to full shade."
