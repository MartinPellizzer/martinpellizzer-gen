    "intro": "Rhinacanthus dichotomus var. dichotomus, commonly known as the split-leaf hibiscus, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, deeply lobed leaves that are typically divided into two or more parts. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of red, yellow, or orange, which bloom throughout the year in warm climates. Its fibrous roots and thick stems make it drought-tolerant, while its rapid growth rate makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. However, it can become invasive in some regions if not managed properly."
