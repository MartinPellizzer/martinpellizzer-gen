    "intro": "Rulingia madagascariensis var. hildebrandtii, commonly known as the Hildebrandt's rulingia, is a unique plant native to Madagascar. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in cyathia, a feature common in the Euphorbiaceae family. Its growth habit is shrub-like, with a dense, bushy appearance that makes it an interesting specimen in botanical gardens. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
