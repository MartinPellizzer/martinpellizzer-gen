    "intro": "Rhipsalis mittleri, commonly known as the Christmas cactus, is a species of epiphytic cactus native to Brazil. It is characterized by its trailing stems and clusters of fragrant, tubular flowers that bloom in winter. The plant has segmented stems that can grow up to several feet long, often cascading from hanging baskets. Its leaves are usually small, pointed, and green, with a waxy surface. Rhipsalis mittleri thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
