    "intro": "Rosa tomentosa var. subcristata, commonly known as the woolly rose or the subcristate rose, is a compact, shrub-like species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, grayish-white pubescence covering the stems and leaves, which provides a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink to white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its foliage is evergreen, with leathery, oval-shaped leaves that remain throughout the year. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in cooler climates."
