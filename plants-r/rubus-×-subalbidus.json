    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 subalbidus, commonly known as the white-berried blackberry, is a hybrid plant belonging to the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves, typical of the Rubus genus. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that give way to berries which are usually less intensely colored than those of other Rubus species. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils. Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits a range of morphological variations."
