    "intro": "Rubus paratauricus, commonly known as the alpine blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its erect or scrambling growth habit, with thorny stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, dark red to black berries that are typically edible and have a tart flavor. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool temperatures and well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within the Rubus genus."
