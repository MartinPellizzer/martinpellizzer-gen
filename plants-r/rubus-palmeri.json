    "intro": "Rubus palmeri, commonly known as Palmer's blackberry, is a species of brambles native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its thorny stems, compound leaves, and small, aggregate fruits that ripen to a dark purple or black color. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. It produces white to pale pink flowers in the spring, which are pollinated by insects. The fruit is edible and has a flavor similar to other blackberries, though it is less commonly cultivated."
