    "intro": "Ranunculus palensis, commonly known as the alpine buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It features showy, yellow to orange flowers with five to eight petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has a basal rosette of leaves that are deeply lobed and covered in fine hairs. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to thrive in cool, moist, and well-drained soils. Ranunculus palensis is often found in meadows, rocky slopes, and mountainous areas where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
