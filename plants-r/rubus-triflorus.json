    "intro": "Rubus triflorus, commonly known as the three-flowered blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets, and its small, edible blackberries that ripen in late summer. The plant produces prickly stems and has a shrub-like growth habit, often found in moist, woodland environments. It plays an important ecological role by providing food for wildlife and supporting local biodiversity. Its botanical features make it a notable species within the Rubus genus."
