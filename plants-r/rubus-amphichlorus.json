    "intro": "Rubus amphichlorus, commonly known as the twin-leaf blackberry, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central America, particularly in countries like Guatemala and Honduras. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves, which are divided into two pairs of leaflets, giving it its common name. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, and it produces small, edible berries similar to other blackberry species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and somewhat obscure member of the Rubus genus."
