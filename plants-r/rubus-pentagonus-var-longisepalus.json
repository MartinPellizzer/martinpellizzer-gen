    "intro": "Rubus pentagonus var. longisepalus, commonly known as the long-sepaled blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to North America. It is characterized by its distinctive five-lobed leaves and elongated sepals that persist on the fruit. The plant produces dark purple to black berries that are typically larger and more flavorful than those of other blackberry varieties. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils. The longisepalus variant is valued for both its ornamental appeal and its edible fruit."
