It is characterized by its dense, spiny stems that form a compact, rounded shape. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are modified into short, cylindrical stems, and it is well adapted to arid environments. Rebutia vulpina is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
