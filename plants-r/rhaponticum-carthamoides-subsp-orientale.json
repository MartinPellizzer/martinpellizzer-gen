    "intro": "Rhaponticum carthamoides subsp. orientale, commonly known as oriental hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Central Asia and parts of Europe. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, sunny grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant features upright stems with lance-shaped leaves and produces yellow flowers in clusters. It is characterized by its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes, making it a potential invasive species in some regions. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes many economically and ecologically important plants."
