It is characterized by its biennial growth habit, with upright stems that bear compound leaves with serrated margins. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits known as drupes, which are typically red when ripe. Its flowers are white and arranged in clusters, and it is often found in rocky or gravelly soils. The subspecies subvestitus is distinguished by its reduced leaf pubescence compared to other varieties of Rubus salisburgensis."
