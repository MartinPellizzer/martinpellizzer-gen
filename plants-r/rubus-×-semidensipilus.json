    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 semidensipilus, commonly known as the Pacific blackberry, is a hybrid plant species native to the western coast of North America. It is characterized by its thorny stems and dense, dark green foliage. The plant produces aggregate fruits composed of small, juicy drupelets that are typically dark red to black in color. It thrives in coastal and moist environments, often growing in shrublands and along stream banks. Due to its hardiness and adaptability, it is both ecologically significant and occasionally considered invasive in certain regions."
