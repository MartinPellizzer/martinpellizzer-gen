    "intro": "Rhus toxicodendron var. negundo, commonly known as the staghorn sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to North America. It is characterized by its smooth, red-tinged bark and compound leaves that turn vibrant yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by clusters of red, fuzzy berries. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in dry, disturbed soils. Due to its toxic sap, it requires caution when handling."
