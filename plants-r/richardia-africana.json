    "intro": "Richardia africana, commonly known as African rock fig, is a small evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, glossy dark green leaves and small, clustered white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces edible berries that are typically consumed raw or cooked. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal areas. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in subtropical and tropical regions."
