    "intro": "Rosa ustalica, commonly known as the alpine rose, is a species of flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white, often blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and covered in a fine layer of white or gray hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh climates. Rosa ustalica is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
