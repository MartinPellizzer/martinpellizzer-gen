    "intro": "Rumex nemolapathum var. exsanguis, commonly known as the blood-red sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Polygonaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive reddish-purple leaves and stems, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are edible, though they contain oxalic acid and should be consumed in moderation. It produces small, greenish flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are followed by three-lobed seed capsules."
