    "intro": "Rubus nemorosus var. lamprococcus, commonly known as the glossy blackberry, is a variant of the brambles native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dark, almost black, fruits that are typically larger and more intensely flavored than those of other Rubus species. The plant produces compound leaves with serrated edges and thorny stems, typical of the Rubus genus. It thrives in woodland edges and disturbed soils, preferring partial shade to full sun. The berries are often used in jams and desserts, though they are not as widely cultivated as other blackberry varieties."
