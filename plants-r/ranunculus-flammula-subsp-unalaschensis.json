    "intro": "Ranunculus flammula subsp. unalaschensis, commonly known as the Alaska buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers with five to nine petals, which bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are palmately lobed and often covered in fine hairs. The subspecies is distinguished by its smaller stature and slightly different floral morphology compared to the more widespread R. flammula."
