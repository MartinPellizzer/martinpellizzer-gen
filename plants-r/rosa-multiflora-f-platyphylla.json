It is a deciduous shrub native to East Asia, particularly China, and is known for its fragrant, pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has been used in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits. Its growth habit makes it suitable for hedging and landscaping, though it can become invasive in some regions."
