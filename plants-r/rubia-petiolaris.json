    "intro": "Rubia petiolaris, commonly known as the petioled woodruff, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants known for their ornamental and medicinal uses. The plant features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. Its small, white flowers are typically clustered in umbels and bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly hairy texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
