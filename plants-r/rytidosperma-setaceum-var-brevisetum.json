    "intro": "Rytidosperma setaceum var. brevisetum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf spinifex grass, is a perennial grass species native to Australia. It is characterized by its compact, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear pale green to golden flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or rocky soils. This variety is valued for its drought tolerance and is commonly used in rehabilitation of degraded landscapes."
