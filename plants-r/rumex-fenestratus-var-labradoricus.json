    "intro": "Rumex fenestratus var. labradoricus, commonly known as Labrador sorrel, is a perennial herb native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America. It is characterized by its distinctive arrow-shaped leaves with a prominent central vein and a serrated margin. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in dense clusters during the summer months. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in tundra and wetland habitats. Its leaves are edible but contain oxalic acid, making them potentially toxic if consumed in large quantities."
