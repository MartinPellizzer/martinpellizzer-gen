    "intro": "Rumex acetosella var. perpusilla, commonly known as lesser sorrel, is a low-growing perennial herb native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features small, heart-shaped leaves with a sour taste due to the presence of oxalic acid. The plant produces clusters of tiny, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread easily and form dense mats."
