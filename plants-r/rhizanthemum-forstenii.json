    "intro": "Rhizanthemum forstenii, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a unique flowering plant native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is a terrestrial orchid that lacks leaves and instead absorbs nutrients through its roots. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in late summer. Its roots form a symbiotic relationship with specific fungi, which help it obtain nutrients from the soil. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
