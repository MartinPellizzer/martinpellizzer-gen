    "intro": "Rosa viscaria var. longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed dog\u73ab\u7470, is a species of rose native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its long, slender stems and clusters of small, fragrant pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces prickly, woody stems with thorns, typical of many rose species, and has compound leaves with serrated edges. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a hardy ornamental plant. Its botanical features make it a valuable addition to both horticultural collections and ecological studies."
