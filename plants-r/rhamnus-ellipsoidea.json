    "intro": "Rhamnus ellipsoidea, commonly known as the elliptic buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to parts of Asia, particularly China and the Himalayas. It typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters and features small, elliptical leaves that are glossy and dark green on top. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, followed by dark blue berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas or along stream banks. Its ecological importance lies in providing food and habitat for various wildlife species."
