It features small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has thorny stems and lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Due to its hardy nature, Rosa prostata is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil."
