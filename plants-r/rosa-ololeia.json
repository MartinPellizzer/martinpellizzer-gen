    "intro": "Rosa ololeia, commonly known as the sweetbriar rose, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces rose hips, which are the fruit containing the seeds. Rosa ololeia thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it a hardy ornamental plant. Its historical use in herbal medicine and as a source of perfume adds to its botanical significance."
