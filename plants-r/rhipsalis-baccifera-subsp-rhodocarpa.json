    "intro": "Rhipsalis baccifera subsp. rhodocarpa, commonly known as the red-fruit mistletoe, is a species of flowering plant in the Cactaceae family. It is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of trees, drawing water and nutrients from its host. The plant is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, fleshy leaves. Its flowers are typically white or pale green, and it produces small, red berries that are an important food source for birds. This subspecies is native to parts of South America and is often found in humid, shaded environments."
