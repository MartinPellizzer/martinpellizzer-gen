    "intro": "Rumex ujskensis, commonly known as the Ujskensk senna, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Polygonaceae family, which includes plants such as sorrel and buckthorn. The plant is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves with a distinctive reddish tint on the underside. It produces small, greenish flowers arranged in dense clusters, and its seeds are enclosed in a three-lobed capsule. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
