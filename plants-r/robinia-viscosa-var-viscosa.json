    "intro": "Robinia viscosa var. viscosa, commonly known as the yellowwood tree, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, light gray bark and compound leaves that are pinnately arranged with oval-shaped leaflets. The tree produces fragrant, yellowish-white flowers in upright clusters during the spring, which are followed by flat, pod-like fruits. It is adapted to a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained soils and full sun. The species is also valued for its durable wood and is often used in landscaping and reforestation efforts."
