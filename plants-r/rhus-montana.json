    "intro": "Rhus montana, commonly known as smooth sumac, is a deciduous shrub native to North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are usually pinnately arranged with 11 to 31 leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by red, fuzzy berries that are a food source for birds and other wildlife. Rhus montana thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in woodland edges and mountainous regions. Its adaptability makes it a common plant in various ecological settings across its range."
