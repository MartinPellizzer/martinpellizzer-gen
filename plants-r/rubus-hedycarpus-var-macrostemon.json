    "intro": "Rubus hedycarpus var. macrostemon, commonly known as the large-fruited blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its large, dark purple to black berries that are typically larger than those of other Rubus species. The plant produces compound leaves with serrated edges and has thorny stems typical of the Rubus genus. It thrives in moist, fertile soils and is often found in woodland areas or along streambanks. The fruit is edible, though some varieties may have a mild astringent taste."
