It is characterized by its opposite, simple, and often hairy leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by red, fleshy berries. Randia ebracteata is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Its botanical features make it an important component of its native ecosystems."
