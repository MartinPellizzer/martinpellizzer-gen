The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by small, dark berries in the autumn. Its leaves and fruits contain anthraquinones, which have been used in traditional medicine. Rhamnus rosei thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and rocky areas."
