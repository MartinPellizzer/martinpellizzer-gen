    "intro": "Rubus melanoxylon subsp. alpinivagus, commonly known as the alpine blackberry, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its prickly stems and dark, edible berries that ripen in late summer. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments at high altitudes, often found in cloud forests and alpine meadows. Its leaves are typically trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it produces white to pale pink flowers in clusters. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine by local communities."
