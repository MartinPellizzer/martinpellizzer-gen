    "intro": "Ranunculus collomae, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada buttercup, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its delicate, yellow or white flowers with five to eight petals. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as mountain meadows and forest floors. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a hairy surface that helps reduce water loss. Ranunculus collomae is an important part of the local ecosystem, providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for small invertebrates."
