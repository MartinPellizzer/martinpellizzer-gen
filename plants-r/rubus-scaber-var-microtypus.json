    "intro": "Rubus scaber var. microtypus, commonly known as the dwarf brambles or microtypus raspberry, is a compact shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features thorny stems and trifoliate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red when ripe. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its small size and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and used in hedgerows."
