    "intro": "Rungia stolonifera, commonly known as the creeping raspberry or false raspberry, is a tropical shrub belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its prostrate or trailing growth habit, with stolons that root at the nodes to form new plants. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or white, followed by edible, berry-like fruits. Its leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with a rough texture and prominent veins. Rungia stolonifera is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine in some regions."
