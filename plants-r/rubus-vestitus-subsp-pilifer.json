    "intro": "Rubus vestitus subsp. pilifer, commonly known as the hairy raspberry, is a species of bramble native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red when mature. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils. Its botanical features make it identifiable within the Rubus genus, though it is less commonly cultivated than other raspberry species."
