It features delicate, bright yellow flowers with five to seven petals, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. The plant has finely divided, trifoliate leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.
