    "intro": "Rytigynia canthioides, commonly known as the white-flowered rytigynia, is a small evergreen shrub native to the rainforests of eastern Australia. It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters and features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. These flowers are followed by small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. Rytigynia canthioides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and floral display."
