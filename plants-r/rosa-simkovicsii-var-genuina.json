    "intro": "Rosa simkovicsii var. genuina, commonly known as the Simkovics' rose, is a rare and specialized species native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant exhibits hirsute foliage and thorny stems, typical of many rose species. It prefers well-drained soil and partial shade, thriving in cooler, humid environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a botanical curiosity and a subject of interest for horticultural research."
