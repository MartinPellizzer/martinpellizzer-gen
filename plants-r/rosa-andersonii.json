    "intro": "Rosa andersonii, commonly known as the Anderson rose, is a rare and endemic species native to the western United States. It is a shrub-like plant with thorny stems and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are compound, with five to seven leaflets, and its flowers are usually pink or white. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Rosa andersonii is considered a conservation concern."
