    "intro": "Rumex \u00d7 salisburgensis, commonly known as the hybrid sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Polygonaceae family. It is a naturally occurring hybrid between Rumex acetosa (common sorrel) and Rumex acetobulus (broad-leafed sorrel). The plant typically features broad, heart-shaped leaves with a reddish or purplish tinge along the veins. It produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, and its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively. This hybrid is often found in moist, disturbed soils in temperate regions."
