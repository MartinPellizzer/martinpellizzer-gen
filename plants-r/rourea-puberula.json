    "intro": "Rourea puberula, commonly known as the velvetwood, is a small evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its smooth, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in the spring or early summer. Its woody stems are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. Rourea puberula is well adapted to moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
