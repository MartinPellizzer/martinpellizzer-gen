    "intro": "Rosa rubiginosa f. schulzei, commonly known as the Schulze's rose, is a botanical variant of the shrub rose native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and clusters of fragrant, pinkish-red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, oval-shaped leaves with serrated edges, typical of many rose species. Its flowers are often used in perfumery due to their strong, sweet scent. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and resilience in harsh, arid environments."
