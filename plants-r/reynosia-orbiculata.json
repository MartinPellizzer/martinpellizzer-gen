It features compound leaves with three to five oval-shaped leaflets that are typically glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by orange to red berries in the fall. These berries are an important food source for various bird species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in chaparral and woodland habitats."
