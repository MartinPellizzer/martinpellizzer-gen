    "intro": "Rhododendron discolor, commonly known as the variable rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Asia, particularly in China, Korea, and Japan. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring dense, leathery leaves that change color throughout the seasons. The plant produces showy, clustered flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, which bloom in spring. Its botanical characteristics include glandular hairs on the leaves and flowers, and it is often found in moist, shaded forest environments. Rhododendron discolor is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant floral display."
