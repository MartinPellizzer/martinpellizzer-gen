    "intro": "Rhododendron ponticum var. obtusum, commonly known as the Turkish rhododendron, is a shrub native to the Caucasus and Anatolia regions. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils and thrives in shaded to semi-shaded environments. It has a spreading habit and can reach heights of up to 3 meters, making it a prominent feature in its natural habitat. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain areas."
