    "intro": "Reyesia, commonly known as the golden star orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its striking yellow and orange flowers. The plants typically grow as epiphytes, attaching themselves to trees in humid, shaded environments. Reyesia species often have narrow, strap-like leaves and produce fragrant blooms during the wet season. Due to their ornamental value, some species are cultivated in botanical gardens and by hobbyists."
