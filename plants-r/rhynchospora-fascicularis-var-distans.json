    "intro": "Rhynchospora fascicularis var. distans, commonly known as the narrow-leaved tussock sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in marshes, bogs, and other moist environments, thriving in nutrient-poor soils. The plant has grass-like leaves that are narrow and arranged in a dense, tussock-like formation. Its inflorescence consists of a cylindrical spike of small, three-parted flowers, which are usually greenish or brownish in color. This variety is distinguished by its narrow leaves and is often found in association with other sedges and grasses in wetland ecosystems."
