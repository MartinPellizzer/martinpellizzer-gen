    "intro": "Rumex salicifolius f. escallosus, commonly known as the Escallos' dock, is a variant of the common dock, characterized by its distinctive leaf morphology. It features broad, lance-shaped leaves with a prominent midrib, often with a waxy coating that aids in water retention. The plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-rich soils, often found in wetlands or along streambanks. Its flowering stems bear small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense, erect inflorescences. This form is notable for its ecological adaptability and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes."
