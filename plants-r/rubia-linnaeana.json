    "intro": "Rubia linnaeana, commonly known as Swedish knapweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and have a distinctive serrated edge. Rubia linnaeana is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, and it plays a role in supporting pollinators."
