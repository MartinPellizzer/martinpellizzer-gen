    "intro": "Rapanea urceolata, commonly known as the pitcher plant, is a unique species of flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive pitcher-shaped leaves that function as traps to capture and digest insects. The plant's botanical features include its sympodial growth habit and the presence of specialized glands on its leaf surfaces. It belongs to the family Ericaceae and is adapted to grow in nutrient-poor soils. The plant's ability to derive nutrients from captured prey makes it an important component of its ecological niche."
