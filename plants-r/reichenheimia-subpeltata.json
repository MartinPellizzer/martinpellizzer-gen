    "intro": "Reichenheimia subpeltata, commonly known as the red-flowered marsh orchid, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetlands and marshy areas in the eastern United States. It features a rhizomatous root system that helps it thrive in waterlogged soils. The plant produces tall, slender stems that bear clusters of showy, red or pinkish-red flowers with a distinctive, spurred lip. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, arranged in a rosette at the base. The species is notable for its ability to tolerate fluctuating water levels and is often found in swampy habitats."
