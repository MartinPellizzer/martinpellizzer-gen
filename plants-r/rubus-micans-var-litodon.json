It is characterized by its distinctive silver-tinged leaves and small, dark berries. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests or woodland edges. Its leaves are usually elliptical with serrated edges and a dense covering of fine hairs. The fruit, while edible, is often less flavorful compared to other blackberry varieties."
