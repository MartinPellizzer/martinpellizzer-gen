    "intro": "Rorippa curvisiliqua var. orientaiis, commonly known as the oriental watercress, is a member of the Brassicaceae family and is characterized by its aquatic or semi-aquatic growth habit. It typically features slender, branched stems that emerge from water or moist soil, often forming dense, floating mats. The leaves are alternate, linear to lanceolate, and usually have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Small, yellow flowers are arranged in racemes and bloom during the spring and early summer. This variety is native to parts of Asia and is valued for its peppery flavor, making it a popular edible plant in certain cuisines."
