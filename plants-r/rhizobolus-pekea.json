    "intro": "Rhizobolus pekea, commonly known as the pekana orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pale pink. The plant has a short rhizome system, which helps it anchor in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered in a fine layer of wax to reduce water loss. Due to its specific habitat requirements, Rhizobolus pekea is considered endangered and is often found in protected botanical gardens."
