    "intro": "Rosa carolina var. sabulosa, commonly known as the sand rose, is a shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, upright growth habit and its ability to thrive in sandy or well-drained soils. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, fuzzy hips. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a serrated margin, typical of many rose species. This variety is well adapted to coastal and inland dune environments, making it a hardy and resilient plant."
