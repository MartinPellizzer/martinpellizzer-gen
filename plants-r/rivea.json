    "intro": "Rivea, commonly known as the morning glory, is a genus of flowering plants in the Convolvulaceae family. These plants are characterized by their rapid growth and heliotropic leaves that follow the sun's movement. Rivea species typically produce showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of blue, purple, and white. They are native to the Americas and often thrive in warm, tropical climates. Many Rivea species are cultivated as ornamental plants due to their vibrant blooms and climbing habit."
