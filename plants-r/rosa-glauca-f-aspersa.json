    "intro": "Rosa glauca f. aspersa, commonly known as the glaucous rose, is a variant of the Rosa glauca species, characterized by its distinctive bluish-gray foliage. This plant is native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a fine, powdery coating that gives them their characteristic glaucous appearance. It produces fragrant, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is often cultivated in gardens and rockeries."
