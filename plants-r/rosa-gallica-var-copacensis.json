It features upright stems with dark green, lobed leaves and produces fragrant, semi-double pink flowers. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal in gardens. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, though it can tolerate partial shade. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a valuable species for botanical collections and conservation efforts."
