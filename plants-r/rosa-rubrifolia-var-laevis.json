    "intro": "Rosa rubrifolia var. laevis, commonly known as the smooth-stemmed redleaf rose, is a shrub-like species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown stems and dense, dark green foliage that turns vibrant red in the fall. The plant produces fragrant, semi-double pink to red flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its hardy nature and aesthetic appeal make it a valuable addition to both landscape designs and botanical collections."
