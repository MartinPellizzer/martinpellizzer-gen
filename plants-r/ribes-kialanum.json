    "intro": "Ribes kialanum, commonly known as the Kialanum gooseberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It belongs to the Saxifragaceae family and is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and alternate, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by edible, sour berries in the summer. Its botanical features make it a hardy species adapted to cool, moist environments with well-drained soil. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine."
