It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and produces edible black berries. Native to Europe and western Asia, this plant thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodlands and hedgerows. The plant has a trailing or shrub-like growth habit, with thorny stems that support its climbing or spreading form. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, and it plays a role in supporting local pollinators and wildlife."
