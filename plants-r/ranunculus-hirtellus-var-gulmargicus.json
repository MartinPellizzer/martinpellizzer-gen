    "intro": "Ranunculus hirtellus var. gulmargicus, commonly known as the Gulmarg Ranunculus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It features delicate, cup-shaped flowers with a yellow center and white or pale pink petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are hairy, giving it a distinctive texture. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
