    "intro": "Rosa canina var. viridicata, commonly known as the green-fruited dog rose, is a variant of the common dog rose. It is characterized by its dark green, almost leaf-like fruiting structures that persist on the plant throughout the winter. The plant produces pink to white flowers in early summer, which are followed by its distinctive green hips. It is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in woodland edges and hedgerows. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in herbal medicine."
