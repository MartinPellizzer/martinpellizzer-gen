    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 aletinus, commonly known as the blackberry bramble, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Rubus ursinus (the blackberry) and Rubus pectoralis (the dewberry). It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with three to five leaflets. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black in color, often with a sweet to tart flavor. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges, thickets, and disturbed soils. Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits a range of morphological and genetic variations."
