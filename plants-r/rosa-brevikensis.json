    "intro": "Rosa brevikensis, commonly known as the Brevik rose, is a rare species native to the mountainous regions of southern Norway. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and vibrant pink to red flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has dark green, serrated leaves and produces fragrant, thorned stems typical of many rose species. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires a cool, moist climate to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Rosa brevikensis is considered a conservation concern."
