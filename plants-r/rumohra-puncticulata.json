It is characterized by its distinctive fronds with small, punctuated dots along the veins, which give it its common name. Native to South America, particularly Brazil, this plant thrives in moist, shaded environments. The fronds are typically leathery and have a compact, upright growth habit. It is often found in humid forests and is valued for its ornamental appearance in horticulture."
