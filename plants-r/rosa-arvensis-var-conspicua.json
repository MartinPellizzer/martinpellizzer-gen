    "intro": "Rosa arvensis var. conspicua, commonly known as the showy field rose, is a variant of the field rose that exhibits more striking floral characteristics. It is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia, typically found in open habitats such as meadows and roadsides. The plant features compound leaves with serrated margins and produces fragrant, pink to red flowers in clusters. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a wild relative of cultivated roses, offering genetic diversity for breeding programs. The species is also valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological benefits to pollinators."
