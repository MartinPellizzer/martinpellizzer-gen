    "intro": "Rosa pomifera subvar. minuta, commonly known as the dwarf rose hip plant, is a lesser-known species within the rose family. It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and the production of fleshy, berry-like fruits called rose hips. The plant typically grows in shrub form, with thorny stems and dark green, serrated leaves. Its flowers are usually pink or white, and the fruits mature to a red or orange color. This subvariety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and the edible seeds within its hips."
