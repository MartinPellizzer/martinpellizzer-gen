    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus subsp. hypochromatinus, commonly known as the pale-leaf buttercup, is a member of the Ranunculaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers with five broadly ovate petals. The subspecies is distinguished by its pale greenish-yellow foliage, which is less intensely colored than that of the typical R. auricomus. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in meadows and woodland edges. The plant is noted for its delicate appearance and is often found in temperate regions of Europe."
