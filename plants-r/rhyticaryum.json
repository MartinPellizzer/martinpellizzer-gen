    "intro": "Rhyticaryum, commonly known as the false dandelion, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. These plants are characterized by their basal rosettes of leaves and yellow ray flowers that resemble dandelions. Rhyticaryum species are typically found in arid and semi-arid regions, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. The leaves are usually hairy and have a distinctive, sometimes spiny, appearance. The genus includes several species, such as Rhyticaryum acanthocarpum and Rhyticaryum trichocarpum, which are native to parts of Africa and the Middle East."
