    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 legrandianus, commonly known as the blackberry bramble, is a hybrid plant within the Rubus genus. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves, typical of many bramble species. The plant produces aggregate fruits, which are commonly referred to as blackberries, and are valued for their tart flavor and culinary uses. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in hedgerows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils. Due to its vigorous growth, it can become invasive in certain regions if not managed properly."
