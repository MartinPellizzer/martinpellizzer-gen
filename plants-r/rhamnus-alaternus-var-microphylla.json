    "intro": "Rhamnus alaternus var. microphylla, commonly known as the dwarf buckthorn, is a shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically less than 2 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by dark blue-black berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or dry habitats. Due to its hardiness, it is sometimes used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in challenging conditions."
