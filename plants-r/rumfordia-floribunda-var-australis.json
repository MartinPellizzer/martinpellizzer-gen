    "intro": "Rumfordia floribunda var. australis, commonly known as the Southern Rumfordia, is a flowering plant native to the temperate regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in late spring. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, often forming dense clumps that help the plant retain moisture. This variety is adapted to well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
