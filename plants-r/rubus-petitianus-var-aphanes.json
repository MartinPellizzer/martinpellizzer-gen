    "intro": "Rubus petitianus var. aphanes, commonly known as the creeping blackberry, is a low-growing shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It features slender, trailing stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats of vegetation. The plant produces small, dark red berries that are typically edible but often have a tart flavor. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three leaflets that are covered in fine hairs. This variety is well adapted to moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
