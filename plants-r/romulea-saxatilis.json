    "intro": "Romulea saxatilis, commonly known as the rock romulea, is a perennial bulbous plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its compact, grass-like foliage and striking, salmon-pink to orange flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in full sun, and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its bulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in harsh conditions. Romulea saxatilis is a popular choice for rock gardens due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
