    "intro": "Rhododendron phaeochrysum var. phaeochrysum, commonly known as the golden rhododendron, is a flowering shrub native to the Himalayas. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of showy, golden-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in high-altitude regions with cool, moist climates and well-drained soil. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, providing a striking contrast to the bright floral display. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
