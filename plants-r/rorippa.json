    "intro": "Rorippa, commonly known as watercress, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Brassicaceae. These plants are typically aquatic or semi-aquatic, often found in moist environments such as stream banks and wetlands. They have small, alternate leaves that are usually submerged or floating, and their flowers are white or yellow, arranged in racemes. Rorippa species are characterized by their rapid growth and ability to thrive in nutrient-rich waters. Many species are edible and have been used in traditional cuisines for their peppery flavor."
