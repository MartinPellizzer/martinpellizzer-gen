    "intro": "Rubus idaeus var. caudatus, commonly known as the trailing blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant characterized by its prostrate growth habit. It produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically smaller than those of the common blackberry. The plant features trifoliate leaves with serrated edges and thorny stems that often root at the nodes. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland areas or along the edges of forests. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its edible fruits, which have a tart flavor."
