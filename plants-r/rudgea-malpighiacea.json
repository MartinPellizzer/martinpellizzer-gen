    "intro": "Rudgea malpighiacea, commonly known as the Malpighiaceae or the \"false arum,\" is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its showy, often colorful bracts that resemble flowers, though they are actually modified leaves. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous shrub or vine, with opposite, ovate leaves that are often pubescent. It produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, followed by distinctive, red or orange berries. Rudgea malpighiacea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
