    "intro": "Rosa communis var. oxyphylloides, commonly known as the everblooming rose, is a hybrid rose species characterized by its compact growth habit and continuous flowering throughout the growing season. It features dense, dark green foliage and produces fragrant, semi-double to fully double pink flowers that bloom repeatedly from early summer to late autumn. The plant is well-suited for container gardening and small spaces due to its manageable size and hardy nature. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it adaptable to a variety of garden conditions. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its persistent blooms and resistance to common rose diseases."
