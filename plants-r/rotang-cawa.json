    "intro": "Rotang cawa, commonly known as *Dendrocnide moroides*, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Australia and parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, fibrous stems and is often found in rainforests and moist woodlands. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its leaves are covered in fine, stinging hairs that can cause severe skin irritation upon contact. Rotang cawa is valued for its strong, durable fibers, which have been traditionally used by Indigenous communities for basket-making and other crafts."
