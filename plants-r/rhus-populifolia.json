    "intro": "Rhus populifolia, commonly known as the smooth sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and turn vibrant red in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in upright clusters, followed by red, fuzzy berries that are a food source for birds. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in moist, disturbed soils. Rhus populifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native landscapes."
