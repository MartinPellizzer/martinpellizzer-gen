    "intro": "Ricinus macrocarpus proles japonicus, commonly known as the Japanese castor oil plant, is a species native to Japan. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its large, palmate leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in diameter. The plant produces distinctive yellow flowers followed by spiny, three-lobed seed pods. It is cultivated for its ornamental value and has been used historically for its oil-producing seeds. However, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seed dispersal."
