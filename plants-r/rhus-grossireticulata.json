    "intro": "Rhus grossireticulata, commonly known as the roughleaf sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and have a rough, serrated texture. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers in the spring, followed by red, fuzzy fruits that attract birds and other wildlife. Its bark is thick and ridged, providing a distinctive appearance, while its leaves turn vibrant red in the fall. Rhus grossireticulata is often found in woodland edges and moist soils, contributing to the ecological diversity of its habitat."
