    "intro": "Rebutia aureiflora, commonly known as the golden-flowered rebutia, is a species of cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant features thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, and it produces small, woolly bracts that surround the flowers. Rebutia aureiflora is well-suited for rock gardens and requires minimal water and well-draining soil."
