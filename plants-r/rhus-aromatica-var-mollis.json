    "intro": "Rhus aromatica var. mollis, commonly known as smooth sumac, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically pinnately arranged and turn vibrant red in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in upright clusters, followed by red, fuzzy berries that persist through winter. Smooth sumac is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in open woods, fields, and along streambanks. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partial shade to full sun."
