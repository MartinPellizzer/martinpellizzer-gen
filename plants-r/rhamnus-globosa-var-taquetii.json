    "intro": "Rhamnus globosa var. taquetii, commonly known as the Taquet's buckthorn, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, thorny branches and small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, followed by reddish-brown, berry-like fruits that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil."
