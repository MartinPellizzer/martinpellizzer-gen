    "intro": "Renanthera imschootiana, commonly known as the orchid of the Caribbean, is a tropical orchid native to parts of Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically bloom in clusters of 5 to 10. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are broad and strap-like, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. This species is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its vibrant colors and ease of cultivation."
