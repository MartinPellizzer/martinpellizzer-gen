    "intro": "Rhodiola subpinnata, commonly known as the alpine rose or golden root, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Asia and Europe. It thrives in cold, high-altitude environments and is characterized by its compact growth habit and fleshy, often reddish stems. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers that bloom in late summer, and its leaves are typically alternate and pinnately divided. Rhodiola subpinnata is known for its adaptogenic properties and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. It is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and resilience in harsh climates."
