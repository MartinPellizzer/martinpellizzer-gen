    "intro": "Ribes ferox, commonly known as the prickly gooseberry, is a deciduous shrub native to North America. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces edible berries that ripen to a dark red or black color in late summer. These berries are often used in jams and wines, though they can be quite tart. Ribes ferox is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
