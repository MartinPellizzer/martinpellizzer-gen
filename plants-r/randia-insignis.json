    "intro": "Randia insignis, commonly known as the velvetleaf or yellow-eyed grass, is a tropical plant native to regions of Central and South America. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a rough, velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in summer, followed by elliptical, woody fruits that contain several seeds. Randia insignis is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and agricultural fields, and it has a tendency to spread aggressively, making it a potential weed in some areas."
