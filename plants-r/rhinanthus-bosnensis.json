    "intro": "Rhinanthus bosnensis, commonly known as the Bosnian redtop, is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its striking orange-red flowers. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its specialized roots. Native to the Balkan Peninsula, it thrives in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and forest edges. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with lance-shaped leaves and clusters of tubular flowers. Its blooming period occurs from June to August, making it a notable species in the region's flora."
