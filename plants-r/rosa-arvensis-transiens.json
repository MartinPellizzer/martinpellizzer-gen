    "intro": "Rosa arvensis transiens, commonly known as the creeping dog\u73ab\u7470, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in moist, disturbed soils, such as along roadsides or in meadows. The plant produces small, fragrant pink or white flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, hairy fruits called achenes. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with serrated edges, and the stems are covered in fine, soft hairs. This species is often found in wetland areas and is adapted to thrive in environments with high moisture levels."
