    "intro": "Rhus acutiloba, commonly known as the staghorn sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are arranged in pairs along the stems, and its distinctive reddish-brown bark that becomes furrowed with age. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by bright red, berry-like fruits that are a food source for birds and other wildlife. Rhus acutiloba is often found in open woods, along stream banks, and in disturbed soils, and it has a long history of use by Native American tribes for medicinal and practical purposes."
