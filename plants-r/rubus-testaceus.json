    "intro": "Rubus testaceus, commonly known as the red raspberry. It is a species of brambles native to eastern North America, characterized by its trailing growth habit and thorny stems. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red when ripe, containing numerous tiny seeds. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Rubus testaceus is often found in woodland areas and along streambanks, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife."
