    "intro": "Rubus nitens f. obumbratus, commonly known as the shaded raspberry, is a variant of the raspberry plant characterized by its darker, more intense foliage. It is a shrub that produces small, tart berries similar to those of its parent species. The plant thrives in shaded environments, making it well-suited for woodland or partially shaded garden settings. Its leaves are typically larger and more leathery compared to the standard Rubus nitens. Botanically, it is distinguished by its unique growth habit and darker pigmentation, which contribute to its adaptability in low-light conditions."
