    "intro": "Ranunculus angularis, commonly known as the angular buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features bright yellow flowers with five to nine petals, typically arranged in a cup-like shape. The plant has slender, upright stems that are often branched and covered in fine hairs. Its leaves are palmately divided into three to five lobes, giving it a distinctive, fern-like appearance. Ranunculus angularis thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks."
