    "intro": "Rhytiglossa pectoralis var. monostachya, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rock heath, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils, often in open woodlands or along stream banks. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink to purple in color. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and ability to thrive in full sun to partial shade. Botanically, it is notable for its simple, unbranched inflorescence, which is a distinguishing feature of the monostachya variety."
