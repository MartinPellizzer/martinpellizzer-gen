    "intro": "Rubus idaeus f. caudatus, commonly known as the trailing raspberry, is a variant of the red raspberry plant characterized by its prostrate growth habit. It features small, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant produces small, tart berries similar to those of the common raspberry, though they are often more elongated. It is typically found in moist, shaded areas and is used in landscaping for its ornamental value. This form is less commonly cultivated than the upright varieties but is valued for its unique growth pattern."
