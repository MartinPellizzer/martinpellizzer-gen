It features small, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in spring. The plant has hairy, glandular leaves that give it a distinctive appearance and aid in water retention. Its stems are often thorny, which provides some natural protection against herbivores. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its beauty and fragrance."
