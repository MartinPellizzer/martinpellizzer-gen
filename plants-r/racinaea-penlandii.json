    "intro": "Racinaea penlandii, commonly known as Penland's ghost fern, is a rare and unique fern species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent fronds that resemble ghostly shapes, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Racinaea penlandii is considered a rare and endangered species."
