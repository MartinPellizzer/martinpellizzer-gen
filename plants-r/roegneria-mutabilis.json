    "intro": "Roegneria mutabilis, commonly known as the variable wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that vary in color from green to reddish-brown depending on environmental conditions. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or rocky habitats. Due to its adaptability and aesthetic appeal, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant."
