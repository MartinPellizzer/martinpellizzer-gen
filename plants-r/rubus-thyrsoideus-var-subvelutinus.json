It features erect or ascending stems that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The leaves are typically trifoliate, with three leaflets that are ovate to elliptic in shape and have a slightly serrated margin. The flowers are small, white, and clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences, while the fruit is a dark purple to black aggregate berry. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and edible fruit."
