    "intro": "Restrepia aristulifera f. leathersii, commonly known as the Leathers' spider orchid, is a rare and unique epiphytic orchid native to the high-altitude cloud forests of Colombia. It is characterized by its intricate, spider-like appearance, with long, slender pseudobulbs and delicate, translucent green leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers with a distinctive, intricate pattern of markings. It thrives in cool, humid environments with indirect light and requires well-draining, porous media for optimal growth. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
