    "intro": "Rhododendron tschonoskii var. trinerve, commonly known as the Trinerved Rhododendron, is a species native to the Himalayas and parts of eastern Asia. It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and clusters of bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils and thrives in shaded to partially shaded environments. Its flowers, which range in color from white to pink, bloom in late spring to early summer. The varietal name 'trinerve' refers to the three prominent veins on its leaf blades, a distinctive botanical feature."
