It is characterized by its biennial growth habit, with flowering occurring on the previous year's growth. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or yellow in color. Its leaves are palmately lobed, with a hairy texture that distinguishes it from other Rubus species. It is native to parts of Asia and is often found in woodland and scrub habitats."
