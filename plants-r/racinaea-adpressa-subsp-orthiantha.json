    "intro": "Racinaea adpressa subsp. orthiantha, commonly known as the narrowleaf racinaea, is a rare and specialized fern native to the cloud forests of Central America. It is characterized by its compact, densely packed fronds that form a rosette-like structure, which helps it retain moisture in its humid, shaded habitat. The plant has small, lance-shaped leaves with a distinctive, almost metallic sheen on the upper surface. It produces sporangia in clusters along the margins of its fronds, typical of the Polypodiaceae family. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
