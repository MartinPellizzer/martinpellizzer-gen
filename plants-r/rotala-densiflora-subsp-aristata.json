    "intro": "Rotala densiflora subsp. aristata, commonly known as the dense-flowered water hyssop, is a submerged aquatic plant native to parts of Asia. It features finely divided, narrow leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that are clustered in dense spikes, which bloom during the summer months. It thrives in slow-moving or still freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Its rapid growth rate makes it a popular choice for water gardeners and pond maintenance."
