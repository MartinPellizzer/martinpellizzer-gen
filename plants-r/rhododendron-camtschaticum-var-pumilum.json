It features dense, leathery leaves that are typically dark green with a waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, pinkish-white flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soil and partial to full shade. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in cooler climates."
