It typically grows in marshes, swamps, and other moist environments, often forming dense stands. The plant has upright, grass-like stems that bear spike-like clusters of small, pale green to reddish-brown flowers. Its leaves are usually broad and flat, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Rhynchospora patuligluma plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and birds."
