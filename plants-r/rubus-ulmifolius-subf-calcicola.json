It is characterized by its small, thorny stems and trifoliate leaves with a serrated margin. The flowers are typically pink or white, producing small, aggregate fruits known as berries. It thrives in well-drained, alkaline soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered plant."
