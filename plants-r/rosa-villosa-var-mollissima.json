    "intro": "Rosa villosa var. mollissima, commonly known as the soft-haired rose, is a variation of the Rosa villosa species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its densely hairy stems and leaves, which give it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces fragrant, pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its compact growth habit and ornamental value make it a desirable addition to both cultivated and natural landscapes."
