    "intro": "Rubus hebecaulis microgene subjunctus, commonly known as the slender-stemmed raspberry, is a rare species belonging to the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, aggregated flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces small, red berries that are typically eaten by birds and other wildlife. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions."
