It is characterized by its upright, ribbed stems and lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered greenish-white flowers in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are often used in traditional herbal medicine for their astringent properties. Rumex tenax thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks."
