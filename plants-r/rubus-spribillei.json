    "intro": "Rubus spribillei, commonly known as the Spribille\u2019s blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, dark red to black berries. The plant produces compound leaves with serrated edges and white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
