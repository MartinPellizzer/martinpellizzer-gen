    "intro": "Ranunculus kvedbyensis, commonly known as Kvedby's buttercup, is a perennial herb native to northern Europe. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in meadows and woodland edges. The plant features a basal rosette of heart-shaped leaves and produces showy yellow flowers with five petals. It blooms from late spring to early summer, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
