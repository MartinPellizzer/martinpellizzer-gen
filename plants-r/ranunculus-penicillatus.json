    "intro": "Ranunculus penicillatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features delicate, cup-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange with a central greenish area. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its flowers bloom in early spring, adding a touch of brightness to the early season flora."
