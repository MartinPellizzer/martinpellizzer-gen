It is characterized by its upright growth habit and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or black in color. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and partial sunlight. Due to its limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
