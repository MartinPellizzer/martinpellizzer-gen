    "intro": "Ranunculus tenerescens, commonly known as the Alpine buttercup, is a flowering plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, yellow flowers with five petals and a hairy, glandular stem. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early summer. Ranunculus tenerescens is adapted to high-altitude environments, often blooming at elevations above 2,000 meters."
