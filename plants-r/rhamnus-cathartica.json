    "intro": "Rhamnus cathartica, commonly known as buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its dark green, oval-shaped leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in early spring. The plant produces red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds and other wildlife. Rhamnus cathartica is often used in traditional medicine for its laxative properties due to the presence of anthraquinone compounds. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is commonly found in woodland edges and disturbed areas."
