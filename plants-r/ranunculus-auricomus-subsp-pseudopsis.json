    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus subsp. pseudopsis, commonly known as the golden shield buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features showy, yellow flowers with five broadly ovate petals that resemble a shield, giving it its common name. The plant has a basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly smaller and more rounded petals compared to the typical form of Ranunculus auricomus."
