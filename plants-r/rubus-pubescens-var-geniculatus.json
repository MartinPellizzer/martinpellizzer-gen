    "intro": "Rubus pubescens var. geniculatus, commonly known as the hairy raspberry, is a variant of the raspberry plant native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and trifoliate leaves, which are covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red when ripe, though they may vary in color depending on the variety. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges or disturbed soils. This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and, in some regions, for its edible fruits."
