    "intro": "Rotala mexicana f. major, commonly known as Mexican waterwheel, is a tropical aquatic plant native to Central America. It features finely divided, floating leaves that form a dense, mat-like surface on the water's surface. The plant produces small, white flowers that are typically submerged, making them less visible to the naked eye. It is often cultivated in ponds and water gardens for its ornamental value and ability to help control algae. Rotala mexicana f. major prefers still or slow-moving freshwater and requires moderate to high light conditions for optimal growth."
