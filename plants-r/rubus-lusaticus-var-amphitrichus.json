    "intro": "Rubus lusaticus var. amphitrichus, commonly known as the broad-leaved blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves and dark purple to black fruits that ripen in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its flowers are small and white, arranged in clusters, and it produces achenes that are dispersed by animals. The botanical features of this variety make it distinct within the Rubus genus, particularly in its leaf morphology and fruit size."
