    "intro": "Rosa communis var. globata, commonly known as the globe rose, is a compact, shrub-like plant characterized by its dense, rounded growth habit. It features small, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in clusters throughout the summer. The plant has thorny stems and dark green, serrated leaves that provide a lush backdrop for its showy blossoms. It is well-suited for container gardening or as a decorative hedge due to its manageable size and ornamental appeal. Its botanical name reflects its historical association with the common rose, though it is a distinct variety with a more rounded form."
