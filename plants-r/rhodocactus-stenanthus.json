    "intro": "Rhodocactus stenanthus, commonly known as the narrow-flowered red cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, spiny stems that form a dense, rounded shape. The plant produces vibrant red flowers that bloom in late spring, adding a striking visual contrast to its green foliage. Its botanical features include thick, fleshy stems adapted for water storage, typical of cacti in arid environments. Rhodocactus stenanthus is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained, sandy soils."
