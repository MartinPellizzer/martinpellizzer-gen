    "intro": "Rapanea nummularia, commonly known as the silver maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and distinctive, palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by winged seeds dispersed by the wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near rivers and wetlands. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is a common sight in forests and urban landscapes."
