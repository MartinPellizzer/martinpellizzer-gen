    "intro": "Ricinus communis subsp. persicus, commonly known as Persian castor, is a variant of the castor oil plant native to regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves and distinctive spiny calyces that enclose its bright red, ornamental seeds. The plant produces toxic seeds that contain ricin, a potent toxin, making it potentially hazardous if ingested. Despite its toxicity, it is cultivated for its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine. Its growth habit is typically herbaceous, with a preference for well-drained soils and full sun."
