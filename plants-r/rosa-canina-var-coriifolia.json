    "intro": "Rosa canina var. coriifolia, commonly known as the bristly rose, is a variant of the dog rose that exhibits distinct botanical features. It is characterized by its hairy, bristly stems and leaves, which give it a unique appearance compared to the typical dog rose. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fruits, known as hip fruits, are orange-red, hairy, and contain numerous seeds. This variety is often found in woodland edges and hedgerows, thriving in well-drained soils."
