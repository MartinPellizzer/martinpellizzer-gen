    "intro": "Ranunculus elbrusensis, commonly known as the Elbrus buttercup, is a rare alpine plant native to the Elbrus mountain range in the Caucasus. It is characterized by its delicate, yellowish-white flowers with prominent yellow centers and trifoliate leaves. The plant thrives in high-altitude meadows, often at elevations above 2,000 meters. Its growth is closely tied to the specific environmental conditions of its mountainous habitat. Due to its limited distribution and vulnerability to climate change, it is considered an endangered species."
