    "intro": "Rosa canina var. didoensis, commonly known as the Dido's rose, is a rare botanical variant of the dog rose. It is characterized by its distinctive pink to red flowers and thorny stems, typical of the Rosa genus. This plant is native to specific regions in the Mediterranean, where it thrives in rocky and coastal environments. Its foliage consists of pinnate leaves with serrated edges, and it produces red-orange hips that are rich in vitamin C. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a valuable species in botanical studies and conservation efforts."
