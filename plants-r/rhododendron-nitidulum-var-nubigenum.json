It features dense, leathery foliage that is typically dark green with a glossy surface. The plant produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to red, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is often cultivated in horticultural settings."
