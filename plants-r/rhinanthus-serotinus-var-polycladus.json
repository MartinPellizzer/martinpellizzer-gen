    "intro": "Rhinanthus serotinus var. polycladus, commonly known as the late yellow rattle, is a flowering plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially depends on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and heathlands, often found in nutrient-poor soils. This variety is notable for its role in promoting biodiversity by reducing the dominance of grasses in its native environment."
