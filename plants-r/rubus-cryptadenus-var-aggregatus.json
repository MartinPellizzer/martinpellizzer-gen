It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, dark purple to black berries. The plant produces compound leaves with serrated edges and produces flowers that are typically white or pale pink. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The berries are edible but can be quite tart and are sometimes used in local foraging traditions."
