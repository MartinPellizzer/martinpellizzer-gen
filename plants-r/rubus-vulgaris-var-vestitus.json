    "intro": "Rubus vulgaris var. vestitus, commonly known as the hairy blackberry, is a variant of the common bramble. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and thorny stems, which provide structural support and deter herbivores. The plant produces aggregate fruits, typically black or dark purple, which are edible and used in culinary applications. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in hedgerows and woodland edges. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and ecologically significant species within the Rubus genus."
