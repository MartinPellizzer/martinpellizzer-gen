    "intro": "Ranunculus testiculatus, commonly known as the testicle buttercup, is a small flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, yellow flowers with five to seven petals and a hairy, glandular stem. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three deeply lobed leaflets, and it produces small, greenish fruits that contain several seeds. Due to its habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and protected species in many areas."
