    "intro": "Ricinus metallicus, commonly known as the silver castor oil plant, is a striking ornamental species native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that are covered in fine, silvery hairs, giving it a metallic sheen. The plant produces unique, spiny capsules that contain toxic seeds, similar to other members of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
