    "intro": "Raphionacme hirsuta var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth hairless raphionacme, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the familyApiaceae, commonly known as the carrot or parsley family. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with slender, upright stems and small, opposite leaves that are usually smooth and lance-shaped. Its flowers are small and clustered in umbels, characteristic of the Apiaceae family, and it produces small, dry fruits called schizocarps. This variety is distinguished from the typical form by its glabrous (smooth) surface, lacking the hairy texture found in Raphionacme hirsuta."
