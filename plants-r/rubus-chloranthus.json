    "intro": "Rubus chloranthus, commonly known as the green-flowered blackberry, is a species of bramble native to parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its unique greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a serrated edge, while the fruits are small, aggregate berries. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a delicate and less commonly encountered member of the Rubus genus."
