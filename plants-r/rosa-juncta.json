    "intro": "Rosa juncta, commonly known as the alpine rose, is a species of flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows at high elevations, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. The plant produces showy, pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, pinnately compound, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Rosa juncta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural alpine habitat."
