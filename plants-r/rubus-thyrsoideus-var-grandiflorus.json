    "intro": "Rubus thyrsoideus var. grandiflorus, commonly known as the large-flowered blackberry, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its thorny stems and trifoliate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces large, showy white to pink flowers in the spring, which are followed by edible blackberries in the summer. It thrives in woodland and open areas, preferring partial shade to full sun. Its berries are often used in jams and pies, and the plant is valued for both its ornamental and culinary qualities."
