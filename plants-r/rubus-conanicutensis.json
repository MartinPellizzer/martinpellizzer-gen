    "intro": "Rubus conanicutensis, commonly known as the Conanicut raspberry, is a species of bramble native to the coastal regions of Rhode Island. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and produces small, edible fruits that are typically red or yellow in color. The plant has trifoliate leaves with serrated edges and produces white flowers in the spring. It thrives in sandy soils and is often found along the dunes and shorelines. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant in its native habitat."
