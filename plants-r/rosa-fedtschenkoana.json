    "intro": "Rosa fedtschenkoana, commonly known as the Karakorum rose, is a rare and endangered species native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas and Central Asia. It is characterized by its delicate pink or white flowers and shrub-like growth habit. The plant typically grows in rocky, alpine environments where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are compound, with five to seven leaflets, and it produces small, fragrant blooms. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
