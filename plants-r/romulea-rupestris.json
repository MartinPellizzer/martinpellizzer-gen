    "intro": "Romulea rupestris, commonly known as the rock lily, is a bulbous perennial plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, tufted foliage and produces clusters of striking, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and full sun, making it well-suited for rock gardens and arid landscapes. Its bulbs are adapted to store water, allowing it to survive dry periods. Romulea rupestris is a popular choice for drought-tolerant gardening due to its ornamental value and low maintenance requirements."
