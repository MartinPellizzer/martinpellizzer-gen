    "intro": "Rubus praecipuus, commonly known as the alpine blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its erect or decumbent growth habit and produces small, dark berries that are typically edible. The plant has serrated leaves and produces white or pale yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
