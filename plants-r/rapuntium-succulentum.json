    "intro": "Rapuntium succulentum, commonly known as the succulent thistle, is a member of the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its fleshy, water-storing leaves and spiny, lobed foliage. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Native to arid and semi-arid regions, it is adapted to survive in dry conditions. Its thick, waxy leaves help reduce water loss, making it a resilient succulent."
