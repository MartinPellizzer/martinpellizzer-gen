    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 malignus, commonly known as the devil's raspberry, is a hybrid plant belonging to the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, red, edible berries that are similar in appearance to raspberries but have a more intense flavor. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland areas or along the edges of forests. Due to its invasive nature, it can outcompete native plants and is considered a problematic species in some regions."
