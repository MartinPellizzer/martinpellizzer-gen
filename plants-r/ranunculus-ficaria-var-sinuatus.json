    "intro": "Ranunculus ficaria var. sinuatus, commonly known as the curly water crowfoot, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, bright yellow flowers with five petals and its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shallow waters or along the edges of ponds and streams. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and small fish."
