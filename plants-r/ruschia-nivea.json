    "intro": "Ruschia nivea, commonly known as the snow Ruschia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features compact, fleshy leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
