    "intro": "Ranunculus cooperi, commonly known as the Cooper's buttercup, is a flowering plant belonging to the Ranunculaceae family. It is native to the western United States, particularly found in California and Oregon. The plant features showy, bright yellow flowers with five to eight petals, often surrounded by a ring of sepals that resemble additional petals. Its leaves are typically trifoliate, meaning they are divided into three parts, and are covered in fine hairs. Ranunculus cooperi thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders."
