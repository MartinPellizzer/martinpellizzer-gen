    "intro": "Ranunculus rivularis var. subfluitans, commonly known as the floating water buttercup, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds, ditches, and wet meadows. The plant features small, bright yellow flowers with five petals, often surrounded by several sepals. Its leaves are floating or submerged, with a waxy surface that helps repel water. This variety is notable for its ability to thrive in aquatic environments while maintaining a delicate, ornamental appearance."
