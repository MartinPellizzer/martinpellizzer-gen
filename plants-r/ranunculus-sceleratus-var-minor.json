    "intro": "Ranunculus sceleratus var. minor, commonly known as the lesser celandine, is a low-growing perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically features bright yellow flowers with 5-7 petals, often appearing in early spring. The plant has palmate leaves that are deeply divided, and it thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It is characterized by its rhizomatous root system, which allows it to spread vegetatively. The species is known for its rapid growth and can sometimes become invasive in certain regions."
