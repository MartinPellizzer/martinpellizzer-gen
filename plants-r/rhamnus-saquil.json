    "intro": "Rhamnus saquil, commonly known as the African buckthorn, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its glossy, oval-shaped leaves that are often dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by red or black berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions and is often found in coastal and inland forests. Rhamnus saquil is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and seasonal interest."
