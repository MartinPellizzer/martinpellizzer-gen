It is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit, with thorny stems and compound leaves that are typically lobed or serrated. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits known as drupes, which are usually red or black when mature. Its flowers are distinctive for their pink to rose-colored petals, which bloom in late spring to early summer. This subspecies is native to certain regions of Asia and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands or stream banks."
