    "intro": "Rhamnus cathartica var. intermedia, commonly known as the European buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of 2\u20134 meters, featuring dark green, oval-shaped leaves that turn reddish in autumn. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by black, egg-shaped berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Its bark is smooth and grayish, becoming fissured with age, and it is often found in woodland edges and hedgerows. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in dye production."
