    "intro": "Rockhausenia spathulata, commonly known as the broad-leaf rockrose, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense clusters of small, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of pink to white. The plant features leathery, oval-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color, providing a striking contrast to its floral display. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Rockhausenia spathulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to withstand drought and salty air."
