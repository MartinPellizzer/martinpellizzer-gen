    "intro": "Rosa \u00d7 gallicoides var. inelegans, commonly known as the French rose, is a hybrid species originating from crosses between Rosa gallica and Rosa canina. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and clusters of fragrant, pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is native to Europe and has been cultivated for its ornamental value and historical significance in perfumery. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the flowers are often used in floral arrangements. This variety is well-suited for hedgerows and garden borders due to its hardy nature and attractive appearance."
