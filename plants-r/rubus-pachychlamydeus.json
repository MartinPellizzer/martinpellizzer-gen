It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or yellow when ripe. Its flowers are white and have five petals, with prominent, thickened calyces that give the species its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in forested or rocky habitats."
