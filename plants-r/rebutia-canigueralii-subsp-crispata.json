    "intro": "Rebutia canigueralii subsp. crispata, commonly known as the Crisped Rebutia, is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands. It features a short, cylindrical stem covered in dense, woolly hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces showy, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are thick and fleshy, adapted for storing water, and it thrives in full sun with well-draining soil. This subspecies is prized for its ornamental value and resilience in dry climates."
