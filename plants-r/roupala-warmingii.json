    "intro": "Roupala warmingii, commonly known as the yellow mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees. It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its small, yellowish-green leaves and inconspicuous flowers. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that are a source of food for birds and other wildlife. It is native to parts of South America, particularly in Brazil and Paraguay. Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host tree over time if left unchecked."
