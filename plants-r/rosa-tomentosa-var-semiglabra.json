    "intro": "Rosa tomentosa var. semiglabra, commonly known as the woolly rose or semiglabrous rose, is a deciduous shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, grayish-white pubescence on the stems and leaves, which gives it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces fragrant, pale pink to white flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine, soft hairs. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and hardy nature, thriving in well-drained soil and full sun."
