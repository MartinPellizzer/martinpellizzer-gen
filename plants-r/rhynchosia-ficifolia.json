    "intro": "Rhynchosia ficifolia, commonly known as the \"fig-leaf morning glory,\" is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, velvety leaves that resemble fig leaves, giving it its common name. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically bright yellow or orange with a distinctive red throat. Its seeds are enclosed in a fleshy, orange-red pod that splits open when mature. Rhynchosia ficifolia is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has been used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
