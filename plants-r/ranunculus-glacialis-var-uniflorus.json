    "intro": "Ranunculus glacialis var. uniflorus, commonly known as the alpine buttercup, is a flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its delicate, yellow flowers with five petals and a hairy, glandular stem. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine meadows, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it is often found in mountainous areas of Europe and Asia. This variant is distinguished by its single-flowered inflorescence, which sets it apart from other ranunculus species."
