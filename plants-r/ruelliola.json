    "intro": "Ruelliola, commonly known as the blue-eyed grass, is a member of the Poaceae family, though it is sometimes classified in the Cyperaceae family. It is a small, herbaceous plant with narrow, grass-like leaves and small, blue or violet flowers that bloom in early spring. Ruelliola typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or wetland habitats. The plant is often found in the eastern United States and parts of Canada. Its delicate appearance and early blooming make it a notable species in early season botanical studies."
