    "intro": "Rubus tomentosus f. incisodentatus, commonly known as the hairy blackberry variant with incised teeth, is a variant of the bramble plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its densely hairy stems and leaves, which are often covered in fine, white tomentum. The leaves are typically lobed with sharply incised margins, giving the plant its distinguishing feature. The flowers are small, white or pale green, and appear in clusters, followed by dark purple to black berries. This plant thrives in woodland edges and disturbed soils, and is valued for its ornamental and edible qualities."
