    "intro": "Rhododendron giganteum var. seminudum, commonly known as the nakedleaf laurel. This evergreen shrub is characterized by its large, leathery leaves that are often glabrous or nearly so, giving it its common name. It produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to red, typically blooming in late spring. The plant is native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia, where it thrives in cool, moist, acidic soils. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in shaded environments."
