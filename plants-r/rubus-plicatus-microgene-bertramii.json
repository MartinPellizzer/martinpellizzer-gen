    "intro": "Rubus plicatus microgene bertramii, commonly known as the Bertram's raspberry, is a rare and small-fruited member of the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and small, aggregate fruits that are typically red when ripe. The plant is native to specific regions in the southeastern United States, where it thrives in moist, shaded habitats. Its leaves are compound, with three to five leaflets, and the flowers are usually white or pale pink. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
