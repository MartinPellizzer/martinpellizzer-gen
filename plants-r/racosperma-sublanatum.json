    "intro": "Racosperma sublanatum, commonly known as the velvet acacia, is a small to medium-sized shrub native to Australia. It is characterized by its dense, glandular hairs that give it a velvety appearance, particularly on the stems and leaves. The leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into small, feather-like leaflets, and are often covered in a fine, silky texture. It produces yellow or orange flowers in compact, globular clusters, which are followed by flat, pod-like fruits. This species is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
