    "intro": "Rosa pouzinii var. escurialensis, commonly known as the Escurialensis rose, is a rare and ornamental shrub native to the Pyrenees region of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and clusters of fragrant, semi-double pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has small, elliptical leaves with serrated edges, and its flowering period is typically from May to June. It thrives in well-drained, alkaline soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a botanical curiosity and is often cultivated in specialized gardens."
