    "intro": "Rosa tomentosa var. cinerascens, commonly known as the cinerascens rose, is a variant of the woolly rose native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its densely hairy, grayish foliage and pale pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is typically shrub-like, with thorned stems and small, leathery leaves. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in temperate climates."
