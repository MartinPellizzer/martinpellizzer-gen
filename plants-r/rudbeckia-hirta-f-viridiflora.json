It is characterized by its bright green ray florets and dark, central disk, which give it a striking appearance. This plant is native to North America and thrives in full sun to partial shade. It prefers well-drained soil and is often found in prairies and open woodlands. Rudbeckia hirta f. viridiflora is a popular choice for gardeners due to its hardiness and ability to attract pollinators."
