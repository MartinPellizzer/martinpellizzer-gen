    "intro": "Rhus rigida var. dentata, commonly known as the roughleaf sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are divided into serrated, ovate leaflets with a rough texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, followed by clusters of red, fuzzy berries that are a food source for birds and wildlife. Its bark is thick and fissured, and it thrives in full sun to partial shade in well-drained soils. The plant is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to tolerate various environmental conditions."
