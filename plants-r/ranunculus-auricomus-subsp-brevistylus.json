    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus subsp. brevistylus, commonly known as the short-styled buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It features showy, yellow flowers with five broadly ovate petals that are often tinged with orange or red at the base. The plant typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm, with simple, alternate leaves that are palmately lobed. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and stream banks. The subspecies is distinguished by its shorter style compared to the typical form, a key morphological feature in its classification."
