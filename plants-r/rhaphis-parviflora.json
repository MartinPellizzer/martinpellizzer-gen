    "intro": "Rhaphis parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered rhaphis, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features narrow, dark green, strap-like leaves that are arranged in a compact, upright clump. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in terminal clusters, typically during the warmer months. Its ornamental value comes from its dense foliage and elegant flowering habit. Rhaphis parviflora is often cultivated in shaded gardens or as a houseplant due to its preference for moist, well-drained soil and indirect light."
