    "intro": "Rubus ulmifolius f. apricus, commonly known as the yellow bramble, is a variant of the common bramble. It is characterized by its yellowish flowers and distinctive leaf shape, which resembles that of the elm. This plant is typically found in hedgerows and woodland edges across Europe. It produces edible berries, though they are generally smaller and less flavorful than those of the main species. The plant has a shrub-like growth habit and is often used in traditional herbal medicine."
