    "intro": "Rhamnus grubovii, commonly known as the Caucasian buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to the Caucasus region. It typically grows in forested areas and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves with a smooth texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by dark blue berries that are edible for birds. It has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion. Rhamnus grubovii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in its native habitat."
