It is a small, deciduous tree or shrub that thrives in sandy or muddy soils near the shoreline. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers followed by fleshy, red berries that contain toxic seeds. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a rough texture. The plant is notable for its ability to tolerate salt spray and is often found in mangrove ecosystems."
