    "intro": "Ranunculus cassubicus subsp. hannae, commonly known as the Hannan's buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the Mediterranean region. It features delicate, palmately divided leaves and showy, yellow flowers with five to eight petals. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and along riverbanks. It blooms from late spring to early summer, producing nectar that attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some areas."
