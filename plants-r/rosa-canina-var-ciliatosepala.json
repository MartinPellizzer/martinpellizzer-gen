    "intro": "Rosa canina var. ciliatosepala, commonly known as the ciliate-sepal dog rose, is a variant of the common dog rose, characterized by its distinctive ciliate (fringed) sepals. This plant typically grows as a shrub with thorny stems and pinnate leaves, often found in woodland and hedgerow environments. Its flowers are usually pink or pale red, with five petals and numerous stamens, and they bloom in early summer. The fruit, a red hip, is a characteristic feature and contains achenes surrounded by a fleshy, hairy outer layer. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in herbal medicine."
