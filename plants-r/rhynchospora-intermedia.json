    "intro": "Rhynchospora intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate beakgrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy habitats in North America. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and features grass-like leaves with a narrow, cylindrical shape. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, three-lobed flowers that are often greenish or reddish in color. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in prairie wetlands, bogs, and along the edges of ponds. Rhynchospora intermedia plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and birds."
