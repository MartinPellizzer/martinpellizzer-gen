    "intro": "Rosa \u00d7 schleicheri var. sublaevis, commonly known as the silky rose, is a hybrid rose species characterized by its soft, velvety foliage and pale pink to white flowers. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and is valued for its ornamental qualities in gardens. The plant typically grows as a shrub with arching canes and produces fragrant blooms in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are ovate to elliptical, with a smooth, almost waxy texture that distinguishes it from other rose varieties. This cultivar is relatively disease-resistant and thrives in well-drained soil with full sun exposure."
