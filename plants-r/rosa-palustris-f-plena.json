    "intro": "Rosa palustris f. plena, commonly known as the full-blown swamp rose, is a hybrid form of the swamp rose native to North America. It is characterized by its dense, bushy growth habit and its ability to thrive in moist, boggy environments. The plant produces large, showy flowers that are typically pink or white, with a full, rounded bloom structure. Its foliage is dark green and slightly hairy, providing a striking contrast to the vibrant flowers. This variety is valued in wetland restoration projects and as an ornamental plant in garden settings."
