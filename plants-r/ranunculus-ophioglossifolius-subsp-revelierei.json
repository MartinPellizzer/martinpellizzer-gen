    "intro": "Ranunculus ophioglossifolius subsp. revelierei, commonly known as the Reveliere's buttercup, is a rare and striking member of the Ranunculaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, palmately divided leaves and showy, yellow flowers with numerous stamens. Native to specific regions in Europe, this subspecies thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors. Its botanical features include a short, stout stem and hairy leaves, which aid in its adaptation to its ecological niche. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in some areas."
