    "intro": "Rosa tomentella var. ferretiana, commonly known as the Sierra velvet rose, is a shrub-like plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a soft, velvety appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
