    "intro": "Rubus hirtus var. adenoneurus, commonly known as the rough bramble or adenoneurus blackberry, is a shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its thorny stems, trifoliate leaves, and small, aggregate fruits that ripen to a dark purple or black color. The plant produces white to pale yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by the development of its edible berries. It thrives in woodland edges and disturbed soils, often forming dense thickets. Botanically, it is notable for its complex inflorescence structure and its role in supporting local wildlife."
