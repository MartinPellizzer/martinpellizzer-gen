    "intro": "Ranunculus kymmenensis, commonly known as the Kymmenes buttercup, is a rare aquatic plant native to the Baltic Sea region. It thrives in shallow, freshwater habitats such as lake margins and wet meadows. The plant has delicate, palmately divided leaves and produces showy yellow flowers with five petals. Its flowers are typically short-lived, blooming for only a few days before wilting. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered endangered in many parts of its range."
