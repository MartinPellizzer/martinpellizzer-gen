    "intro": "Ranunculus nelsonii var. glabriusculus, commonly known as the Nelson's buttercup, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family, characterized by its showy, often brightly colored flowers. The plant features a basal rosette of hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine, soft hairs. Its flowers are usually yellow with five petals and numerous stamens, and they bloom in early spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
