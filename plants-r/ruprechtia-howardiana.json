    "intro": "Ruprechtia howardiana, commonly known as the Howard's ruprechtia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Polygonaceae. It is native to the high altitudes of the Andes Mountains in South America, specifically in regions of Peru and Ecuador. The plant is characterized by its upright growth habit, with slender stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. It produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, which bloom during the cooler months. Ruprechtia howardiana is adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats."
