    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 durimontanus var. gymnostachyoides, commonly known as the alpine bramble, is a hybrid plant species native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit, with thorny stems and compound leaves that are typically arranged alternately. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits known as drupes, which are usually red or black in color. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes or as a food source for wildlife."
