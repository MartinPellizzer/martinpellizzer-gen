    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 cuspidatifoliatus, commonly known as the prickly rose or brambles, is a hybrid plant species within the Rubus genus. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves, which are typically trifoliate or pinnate in structure. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits known as drupes, which are often red or black in color. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in hedgerows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils. Due to its aggressive growth habit, it can become invasive in certain regions."
