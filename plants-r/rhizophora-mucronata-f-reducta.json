It is characterized by its reduced pneumatophores, which are specialized root structures for gas exchange in waterlogged soils. The plant exhibits halophytic adaptations, allowing it to thrive in saline environments. Its leaves are typically small and\u9769\u8d28, providing efficient water retention. This variant plays a crucial role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and supporting diverse marine and terrestrial life."
