    "intro": "Rosa \u00d7 tenella, commonly known as the everblooming or perpetual pink rose, is a hybrid rose species resulting from the cross between Rosa rugosa and Rosa moyesii. It is characterized by its vigorous growth habit and ability to produce flowers throughout the growing season. The plant typically features dark green, leathery foliage and thorny stems, which are typical of many rose species. Its flowers are usually pink or red, with a full, bushy appearance that makes it a popular choice for gardens. Rosa \u00d7 tenella is well-suited for hedging and ground cover due to its spreading nature and resilience to various environmental conditions."
