    "intro": "Rubia thunbergii, commonly known as Swedish knotweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its upright, herbaceous stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous and can spread aggressively, making it both a useful medicinal plant and a potential weed. Rubia thunbergii has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its purported antispasmodic and anti-inflammatory properties."
