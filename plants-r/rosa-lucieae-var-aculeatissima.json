    "intro": "Rosa lucieae var. aculeatissima, commonly known as the spiked Rosa Lucieae, is a rare and ornamental shrub native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and clusters of fragrant, pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring. The leaves are compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets with a serrated margin. This variety is prized for its unique appearance and hardiness in moderate climates. Due to its limited distribution, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its horticultural value."
