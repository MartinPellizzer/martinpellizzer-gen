It is characterized by its elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and have a slightly serrated margin. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that ripen to a dark purple or black color, often with a sweet and tangy flavor. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and thickets. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and natural landscapes."
