    "intro": "Ranunculus trigonus, commonly known as the three-lobed buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features delicate, yellow flowers with five to seven petals and a distinctive, hairy stem that often branches near the base. The plant's leaves are trifoliate, meaning they are divided into three leaflets, each of which is typically lobed or toothed. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. The species is known for its early spring blooming habit, making it a notable wildflower in its native habitats."
