    "intro": "Rubus disjectus, commonly known as the scattered blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the western United States. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and produces small, dark berries that are typically clustered in the axils of the leaves. The plant has compound leaves with three to five leaflets, and its flowers are usually white or pale pink. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers moist, well-drained habitats. The berries are edible but are often overlooked due to the plant's less showy appearance compared to other Rubus species."
