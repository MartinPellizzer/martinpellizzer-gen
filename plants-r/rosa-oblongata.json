    "intro": "Rosa oblongata, commonly known as the Chinese rose, is a deciduous shrub native to China and parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and clusters of fragrant, pink or white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are compound, consisting of five to seven oval-shaped leaflets, and the plant produces small, red berries that contain seeds. Rosa oblongata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its beauty and resilience. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy addition to many temperate climates."
