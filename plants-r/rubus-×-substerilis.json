    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 substerilis, commonly known as the sterile blackberry, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Rubus ursinus (slippery elm) and Rubus ursi (another raspberry species). It is characterized by its thorny stems and aggregate fruits that resemble blackberries but are typically smaller and less flavorful. The plant is notable for its reduced fertility, which is a key trait in its hybrid origin. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland areas or along the edges of forests. Its botanical interest lies in its role as a hybrid species that showcases the genetic diversity within the Rubus genus."
