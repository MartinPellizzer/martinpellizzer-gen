It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and clusters of fragrant, pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a compact growth habit with thorny stems and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Its leaves are dark green and covered in a fine, white pubescence, giving it a distinctive appearance.
