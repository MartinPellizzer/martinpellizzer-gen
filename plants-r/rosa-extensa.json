    "intro": "Rosa extensa, commonly known as the spreading rose, is a deciduous shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its arching, thorned stems that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces fragrant, single or semi-double pink to white flowers in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with ovate to elliptical leaflets and a silvery-white underside. Rosa extensa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping for its cascading growth habit."
