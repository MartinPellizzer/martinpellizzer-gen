    "intro": "Restio glomeratus, commonly known as the clustered restio, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Restionaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense, spike-like clusters of small, grass-like leaves. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are typically borne in compact inflorescences. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal or inland fynbos vegetation. Due to its unique structure and habitat, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing microhabitat for small invertebrates."
