    "intro": "Rosa communis subvar. nitens, commonly known as the shining rose, is a botanical variant characterized by its distinctive foliage and floral features. This subvariety is notable for its glossy, dark green leaves that provide a striking contrast to its vibrant pink to red flowers. The flowers are typically larger and more showy than those of the standard Rosa communis, with a more pronounced fragrance. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. The plant is also valued for its hardiness and ability to produce repeat blooms throughout the growing season."
