It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit, with opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, producing a fragrant scent to attract pollinators. Due to its habitat in the rainforest, it plays a role in local ecosystems and is of interest to botanists studying tropical flora."
