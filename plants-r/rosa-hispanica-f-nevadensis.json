    "intro": "Rosa hispanica f. nevadensis, commonly known as the Nevada Spanish rose, is a botanical variant of the Spanish rose, characterized by its distinct floral and foliage features. This subspecies is native to the arid regions of the western United States, particularly Nevada, where it has adapted to harsh environmental conditions. It typically produces compact, shrub-like growth with small, dark green leaves and fragrant, pink to white flowers. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in dry climates. Its botanical study contributes to the understanding of plant adaptation and genetic diversity within the Rosa genus."
