    "intro": "Rosa vayredae var. umbrosa, commonly known as the shaded rose, is a rare and delicate shrub native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, fragrant pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The leaves are dark green and glossy, with a slightly serrated edge, and the plant thrives in shaded, moist environments. It is well-suited for woodland gardens and requires well-drained, acidic soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
