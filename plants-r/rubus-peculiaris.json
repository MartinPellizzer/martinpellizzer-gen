It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits known as drupes, which are typically red or yellow when ripe. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species in certain regions."
