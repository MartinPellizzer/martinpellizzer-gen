    "intro": "Rafflesia tuan-mudae, commonly known as the Tuan-Mudae Rafflesia, is a rare and striking member of the Rafflesia genus found in the rainforests of Borneo. It is notable for producing the world's largest individual flower, with blooms reaching up to 1 meter in diameter. The plant is completely parasitic, lacking leaves, stems, and roots, and relies entirely on its host vine for nutrients. Its flowers emit a strong, foul odor resembling decaying flesh, which attracts carrion flies for pollination. The plant's unique botanical features make it a fascinating subject for botanical study and conservation efforts."
