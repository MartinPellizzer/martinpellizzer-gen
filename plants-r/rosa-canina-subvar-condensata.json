    "intro": "Rosa canina subvar. condensata, commonly known as the dense rose or the shrub rose, is a subspecies of the dog rose native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of fragrant pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The leaves are pinnately compound, with five to seven leaflets that are oval and serrated. Its fruits, known as hips, are orange-red, hairy, and contain a high concentration of vitamin C. This plant is often found in hedgerows, woodland edges, and other disturbed soils, and it plays a role in supporting local wildlife."
