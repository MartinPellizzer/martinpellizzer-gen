    "intro": "Rosa canina var. pilosiuscula, commonly known as the bristly dog rose, is a variant of the dog rose native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces pink to red flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by bright orange to red hips in the fall. Its hairy texture is a result of dense pubescence on the stems, leaves, and flowers. This variety is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and has some historical uses in herbal medicine."
