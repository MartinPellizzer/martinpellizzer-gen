    "intro": "Rhynchospora tenerrima subsp. fallax, commonly known as the slender marsh sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in bogs, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, white to pale green flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense stands in suitable environments. The species is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
