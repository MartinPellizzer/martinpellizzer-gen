    "intro": "Ruehssia fusca, commonly known as the black ruehssia, is a member of the Rubiaceae family, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows as an understory shrub, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported antifungal and antiseptic properties. The fruit is a small capsule that disperses seeds through wind, aiding in its propagation in the wild."
