    "intro": "Rubus caesius var. mitissimus, commonly known as the pale raspberry, is a variant of the raspberry plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its pale pink to white flowers, which bloom in clusters during the spring. The plant produces small, tart berries that are similar in appearance to the common raspberry but with a milder flavor. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, often found in woodland edges or open fields. This variety is valued for both its ornamental appeal and its edible fruits."
