    "intro": "Rhodocodon rotundus, commonly known as the roundleaf rhodocodon, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from pale yellow to orange. The plant's leaves are thick and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun exposure. Due to its unique appearance and resilience, it is sometimes cultivated in xerophytic gardens."
