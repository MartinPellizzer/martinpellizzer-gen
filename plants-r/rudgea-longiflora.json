    "intro": "Rudgea longiflora, commonly known as the long-flowered rudgea, is a striking member of the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a distinctive red or purple spot at the base. Its leaves are typically opposite, simple, and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Rudgea longiflora is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees."
