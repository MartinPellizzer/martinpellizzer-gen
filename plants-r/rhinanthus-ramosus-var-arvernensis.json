    "intro": "Rhinanthus ramosus var. arvernensis, commonly known as the Arvernian yellow rattle, is a flowering plant native to southern France. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Its presence is often an indicator of nutrient-poor soils and can contribute to the biodiversity of its ecosystem."
