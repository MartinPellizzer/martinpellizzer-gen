    "intro": "Radicula lyrata, commonly known as the lyreleaf radicula, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes many aromatic plants such as carrots and parsley. The plant is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves that resemble the shape of a lyre, giving it its common name. Radicula lyrata typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to survive in dry, hot environments. It produces small, white or yellowish flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
