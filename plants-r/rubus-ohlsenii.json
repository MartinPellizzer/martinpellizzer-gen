    "intro": "Rubus ohlsenii, commonly known as the Ohlsen's bramble, is a species of flowering plant in the rose family (Rosaceae). It is native to the Pacific Northwest of North America, specifically found in moist, shaded areas of forests. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits known as drupes, which are typically red or black in color. It has compound leaves with serrated edges and thorny stems typical of the Rubus genus. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
