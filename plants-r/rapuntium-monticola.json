    "intro": "Rapuntium monticola, commonly known as the mountain cress, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early spring. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to thrive in poor, rocky soils. Rapuntium monticola is valued for its edible leaves, which have a peppery flavor similar to that of mustard greens."
