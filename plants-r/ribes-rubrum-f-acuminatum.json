    "intro": "Ribes rubrum f. acuminatum, commonly known as the acute-leaf redcurrant, is a cultivated form of the redcurrant plant. It is characterized by its elongated, pointed leaves that give it a distinct appearance compared to the standard redcurrant. The plant produces small, red berries that are typically harvested in late summer. It is often grown for its ornamental value as well as for its edible fruits. This variety is well-suited to temperate climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
