    "intro": "Ranunculus ficaria f. micraster, commonly known as the dwarf buttercup, is a variant of the common buttercup characterized by its smaller, more compact growth habit. It is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia, typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features delicate, palmately divided leaves and bright yellow, five-petaled flowers that bloom in early spring. Its botanical name reflects its classification within the Ranunculaceae family, which includes many showy, often poisonous flowering plants. The dwarf buttercup is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant, early-season blooms."
