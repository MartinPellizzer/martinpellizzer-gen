    "intro": "Rosa canina var. glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular dog rose, is a variant of the dog rose native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and fragrant pink or white flowers that bloom in early summer. The leaves are pinnately compound, with five to seven oval-shaped leaflets, and the plant produces small, red, hairy fruits called hip fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in hedgerows, woodlands, and along coastal areas. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in herbal medicine."
