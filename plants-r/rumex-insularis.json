    "intro": "Rumex insularis, commonly known as the island sorrel, is a herbaceous plant native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its distinctive heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native range."
