    "intro": "Randia nitida, commonly known as the slender randia, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, opposite leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that are followed by bright red, spherical berries. Randia nitida is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for cultivation in tropical gardens."
