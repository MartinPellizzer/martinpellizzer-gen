    "intro": "Rapuntium chamaepitys, commonly known as the mountain everlasting, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Alps. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense clusters of small, showy yellow flowers. The plant produces achenes as its fruit, which are typically surrounded by bracts that aid in wind dispersal. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh mountain environments. Due to its resilience and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in alpine gardens."
