    "intro": "Rubus diplotrichus, commonly known as the blackberry shrub, is a species of brambles native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces edible blackberries in the summer, which are popular for their sweet and tart flavor. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, loamy soils. Rubus diplotrichus is also valued for its role in supporting local wildlife, including birds and insects."
