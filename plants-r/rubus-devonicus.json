    "intro": "Rubus devonicus, commonly known as Devon raspberry, is a species of bramble native to the British Isles. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows in moist, woodland habitats. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are red when ripe, often used in local foraging. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it has thorny stems typical of the Rubus genus. It plays an important ecological role by providing food for wildlife and supporting biodiversity in its native environment."
