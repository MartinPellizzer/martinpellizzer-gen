    "intro": "Rothia, commonly known as the silverleaf tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Fabaceae. It is characterized by its small, often deciduous leaves that are usually silver or gray in color, giving it its common name. The plants typically have slender, branching stems and produce small, pea-like flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple. Rothia species are native to various regions in Africa, Asia, and Australia, often growing in arid or semi-arid environments. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
