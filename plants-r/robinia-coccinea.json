    "intro": "Robinia coccinea, commonly known as the pink robinia or false acacia, is a deciduous legume native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are trifoliate and have a distinctive reddish-brown color. The plant produces showy, fragrant pink to red flowers in late spring, which are clustered in racemes. Its woody pods, which split open to release seeds, are a notable feature of its botanical structure. Robinia coccinea is also known for its deep root system and ability to fix nitrogen, making it an important plant in ecological restoration efforts."
