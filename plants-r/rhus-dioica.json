    "intro": "Rhus dioica, commonly known as staghorn sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 5 to 11 pairs of serrated leaflets. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, fuzzy berries that persist into the winter. Its bark is thick and rugged, giving it a distinctive appearance, and it is often used in traditional herbal medicine. Rhus dioica is also valued for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its role in supporting local wildlife."
