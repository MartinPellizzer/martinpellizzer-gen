    "intro": "Ribes scandicum, commonly known as creeping currant, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit, with stems that can root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground or climb. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible and often used in jams and preserves. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have serrated edges, while its flowers are typically pale yellow with five petals. Ribes scandicum thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats."
