It is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves with deep, irregularly spaced lobes, which give it its scientific name. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
