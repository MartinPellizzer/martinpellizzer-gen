    "intro": "Rhododendron leucaspis, commonly known as the white-leafed rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its leathery, elliptical leaves that are typically white or pale green on the underside, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of showy, pink to reddish flowers in the spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is often cultivated in horticultural settings."
