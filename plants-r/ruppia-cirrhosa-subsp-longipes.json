    "intro": "Ruppia cirrhosa subsp. longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed sea rocket, is a halophytic plant adapted to brackish and saline environments. It typically grows in coastal areas, estuaries, and shallow waters, where it thrives in the intertidal zone. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, pale yellow flowers that are pollinated by wind. Its seeds are dispersed by water, allowing it to colonize new areas along shorelines. This subspecies is an important component of coastal ecosystems, providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
