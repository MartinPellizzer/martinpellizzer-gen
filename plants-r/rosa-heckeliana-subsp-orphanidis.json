    "intro": "Rosa heckeliana subsp. orphanidis, commonly known as the Orphanidis rose, is a rare and delicate species native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It is characterized by its semi-evergreen foliage and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in forested areas. Its flowers are usually pink to red in color, with a subtle, sweet fragrance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
