It is a shrub native to the southeastern United States, characterized by its thin, wiry stems and small, dark red berries. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are trifoliate, with finely toothed margins, and it produces white to pale pink flowers in the spring. The variety subpauperatus is distinguished by its reduced leaflets and smaller fruit size compared to other Rubus species."
