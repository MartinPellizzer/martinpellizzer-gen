    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 rhodius, commonly known as the bramble rose, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between a raspberry (Rubus idaeus) and a rose (Rosa spp.). It is characterized by its thorny stems, compound leaves, and clusters of small, aggregate fruits. The plant typically grows in temperate regions and thrives in well-drained soil. It is often found in hedgerows, woodland edges, and disturbed areas. Due to its invasive potential, it can outcompete native vegetation in certain ecosystems."
