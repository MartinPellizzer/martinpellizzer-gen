    "intro": "Rajania hastata var. incisa, commonly known as the serrated leaf rajania, is a rare and striking plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It belongs to the family Melanthiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, lobed leaves that resemble those of a fern. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale green flowers that bloom in late spring. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly through underground stems. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
