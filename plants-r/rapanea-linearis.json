    "intro": "Rapanea linearis, commonly known as the narrowleaf holly, is a small evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features lance-shaped, glossy dark green leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stems. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles, followed by small, dark blue berries. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping for its dense, compact growth habit. Rapanea linearis thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens."
