    "intro": "Rotala tenella, commonly known as the dwarf rotala, is a species of aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, rounded leaves that are typically bright green and often have a slight reddish tint. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments and is often used in aquariums for its aesthetic appeal and ability to provide shelter for aquatic life. Rotala tenella grows in dense clusters, with its stems often floating at the water's surface or rooted in the substrate. It is relatively easy to care for, requiring moderate lighting and regular pruning to maintain its compact form."
