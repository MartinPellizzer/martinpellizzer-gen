    "intro": "Ranunculus subtuberosus, commonly known as the tuberous buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a short, thickened rhizome and produces showy, cup-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red. The leaves are deeply lobed and covered in a fine, silky hair, giving them a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and cooler climates, often found in alpine meadows. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and ecological role in its native habitat."
