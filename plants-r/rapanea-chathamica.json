It belongs to the family Lauraceae, which includes laurels and other aromatic plants. The plant features glossy, dark green leaves that are typically oval in shape and have a leathery texture. It produces small, white flowers followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
