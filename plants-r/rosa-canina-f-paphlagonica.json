    "intro": "Rosa canina f. paphlagonica, commonly known as the Paphlagonian dog rose, is a botanical variant of the common dog rose. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and smaller, more densely packed flowers compared to the typical Rosa canina. The plant produces small, red-orange hips that are often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions of Eastern Europe. This form is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical significance in horticulture."
