    "intro": "Rubus caliculatus, commonly known as the calycular blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the western United States. It is characterized by its thorny stems and aggregate fruits, which are typically dark purple to black in color. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by the development of its edible berries in the summer. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the plant thrives in a variety of soil types. Rubus caliculatus is often found in woodland areas and along the edges of streams, where it contributes to local biodiversity."
