    "intro": "Rapunculus linifolius, commonly known as the leafy bellflower, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant has a basal rosette of finely divided, fern-like leaves, which contribute to its ornamental appeal. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The seeds are small and produced in a capsule, and the plant is often cultivated for its aesthetic value in gardens."
