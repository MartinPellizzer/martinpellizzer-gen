    "intro": "Rhamnus purshiana var. annonifolia, commonly known as the Oregon grape, is a deciduous shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 3\u20135 lobed and have a rough, textured surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by dark blue-black berries that are edible but often bitter. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. The species is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used in traditional medicine for its astringent properties."
