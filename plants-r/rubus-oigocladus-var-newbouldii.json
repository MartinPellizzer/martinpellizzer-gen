    "intro": "Rubus oigocladus var. newbouldii, commonly known as the Newbould's blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to specific regions of New Zealand. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically harvested in late summer. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and partial sunlight. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species within its native habitat."
