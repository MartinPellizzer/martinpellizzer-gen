    "intro": "Rubus gracilis var. hypargyrus, commonly known as the silverleaf raspberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, arching stems and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The leaves are trifoliate, with finely toothed margins and a silvery undersurface that gives the plant its distinctive appearance. Its fruit, a small red drupe, ripens in late summer and is edible, though often tart and less commonly cultivated than other raspberries. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological benefits, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
