    "intro": "Rosa alpina var. vestita, commonly known as the Alpine rose or alpine pink, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of delicate, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in full sun. Its leaves are narrow and serrated, and the stems are covered in fine, white hairs. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in alpine gardens for its hardiness and beauty."
