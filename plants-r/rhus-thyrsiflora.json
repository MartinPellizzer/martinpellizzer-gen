    "intro": "Rhus thyrsiflora, commonly known as staghorn sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and have a rough, sandpaper-like texture. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into red, fuzzy fruits called samaras. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in woodlands. Rhus thyrsiflora is also known for its ability to tolerate urban environments and is sometimes used in landscaping for its ornamental value."
