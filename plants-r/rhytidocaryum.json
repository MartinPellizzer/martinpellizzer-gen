    "intro": "Rhytidocaryum, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Anacardiaceae. It consists of several species, most notably Rhytidocaryum burchellii, which is native to southern Africa. The plant is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are often followed by edible, round fruits. The genus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in dry, sandy soils."
