    "intro": "Ranunculus chaerophyllos var. balearicus, commonly known as the Balearic buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Balearic Islands. It features delicate, palmately lobed leaves and bright yellow, spurred flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. It is characterized by its upright stems and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and protected species in its native habitat."
