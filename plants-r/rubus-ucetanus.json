    "intro": "Rubus ucetanus, commonly known as the alpine blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its erect growth habit and produces small, dark purple to black berries. The plant has compound leaves with serrated edges and produces white to pinkish flowers in the spring. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool temperatures and well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
