    "intro": "Ranunculus montanus var. geraniifolius, commonly known as the fern-leaved buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features delicate, palmately divided leaves that resemble those of the geranium, giving it its common name. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain environments."
