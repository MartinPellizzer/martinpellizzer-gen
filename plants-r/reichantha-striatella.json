It is native to parts of Southeast Asia and is often found in moist, shaded environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Reichantha striatella is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
