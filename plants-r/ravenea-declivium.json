    "intro": "Ravenea declivium, commonly known as the cliff ravenea, is a striking plant native to Madagascar. It is a member of the Arecaceae family, characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate leaves. The plant is well adapted to rocky and coastal environments, often growing on cliffs or in sandy soils. Its foliage is dense and dark green, with a waxy texture that helps it retain moisture. Ravenea declivium is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens."
