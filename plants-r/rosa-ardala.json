    "intro": "Rosa ardala, commonly known as the Armenian rose, is a species native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and parts of Turkey. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring thorny stems and dark green, lobed leaves. The plant produces fragrant, pink to red flowers in late spring to early summer, which are followed by orange-red hips. Rosa ardala is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and adaptability to various soil types. Its botanical characteristics make it a unique and resilient addition to the rose family."
