    "intro": "Raciborskanthos, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance with pale greenish-white flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Raciborskanthos is considered critically endangered in many regions."
