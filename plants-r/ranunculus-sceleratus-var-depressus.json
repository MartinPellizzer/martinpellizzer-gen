    "intro": "Ranunculus sceleratus var. depressus, commonly known as the dwarf buttercup, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features small, yellowish flowers with five petals, typically less than 1 inch in diameter, and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are usually heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are short and often prostrate. This variety is closely related to other ranunculus species but is distinguished by its compact growth habit and smaller floral display."
