    "intro": "Resia umbratica, commonly known as the shadow lily, is a rare flowering plant native to the dense, shaded understories of tropical rainforests. It possesses broad, dark green leaves that are adapted to low-light conditions, allowing it to thrive in dim environments. The plant produces striking white and purple flowers that bloom in the early morning, releasing a subtle fragrance to attract pollinators. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize the soil in its natural habitat. Due to habitat loss, Resia umbratica is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation areas."
