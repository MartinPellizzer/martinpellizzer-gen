    "intro": "Ranunculus fallax subsp. antygophyllus, commonly known as the alpine buttercup, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features basal leaves that are palmately lobed and covered in fine hairs, and its flowers are typically yellow with five petals. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain multiple seeds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
