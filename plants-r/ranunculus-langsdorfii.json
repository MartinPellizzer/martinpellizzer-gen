    "intro": "Ranunculus langsdorfii, commonly known as the Langsdorf's buttercup, is a member of the Ranunculaceae family. It is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. The plant features showy, yellow flowers with five petals and numerous stamens, typical of the buttercup genus. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a hairy surface that helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat.
