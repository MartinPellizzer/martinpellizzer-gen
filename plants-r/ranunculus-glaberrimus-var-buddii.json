    "intro": "Ranunculus glaberrimus var. buddii, commonly known as the Budd's hairy buttercup, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and bright yellow, five-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, preferring well-drained soils and full sun. Its flowers bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
