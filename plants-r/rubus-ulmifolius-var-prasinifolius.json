    "intro": "Rubus ulmifolius var. prasinifolius, commonly known as the green-leaved blackberry, is a variant of the common blackberry plant. It is characterized by its distinctive dark green, leathery leaves that are broader and more elongated than those of the typical Rubus ulmifolius. The plant produces small, dark purple berries that are typically smaller and less flavorful compared to standard blackberries. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils. Its botanical features make it a unique subject for horticultural and ecological studies."
