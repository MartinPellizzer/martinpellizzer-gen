    "intro": "Robsonodendron maritimum, commonly known as the coastal hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of South America. It is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to salty air and coastal winds. Its leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a waxy surface to reduce water loss. Robsonodendron maritimum is often found in dune ecosystems and plays a role in stabilizing coastal habitats."
