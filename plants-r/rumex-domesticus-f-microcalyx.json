    "intro": "Rumex domesticus f. microcalyx, commonly known as the small-leaved dock, is a variant of the common dock characterized by its smaller, more compact leaves. It is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia, typically found in moist soils along riverbanks and wet meadows. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, which are followed by triangular, reddish-brown seeds. Its leaves are edible and have been historically used in cooking and as a medicinal plant. The f. microcalyx form is distinguished by its reduced leaf size compared to the typical species."
