    "intro": "Ricinocarpus salicifolius, commonly known as the broad-leaved ricin tree, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, lanceolate leaves and yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces woody capsules that contain toxic seeds, which are a source of the potent toxin ricin. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its toxic properties, it is typically avoided in agricultural settings."
