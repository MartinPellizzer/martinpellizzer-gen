    "intro": "Rosa viscaria var. mirabilis, commonly known as the \"mirabilis rose,\" is a hybrid rose species originating from the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces clusters of semi-double to double pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has glossy, dark green foliage and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for temperate climates. Due to its hybrid origin, it is not typically found in the wild and is primarily grown by horticulturists."
