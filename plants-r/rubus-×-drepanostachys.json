    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 drepanostachys, commonly known as the blackberry raspberry or loganberry, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Rubus ursinus (the raspberry) and Rubus chamaemorus (the cloudberry). It is a perennial shrub with thorny stems and compound leaves that are typically trifoliate. The plant produces aggregate fruits composed of small, drupe-like berries that are usually dark red to black in color. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its tart, flavorful fruit. The botanical characteristics of Rubus \u00d7 drepanostachys make it a unique and valuable species in both horticulture and ecological studies."
