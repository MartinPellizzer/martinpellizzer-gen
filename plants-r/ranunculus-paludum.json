    "intro": "Ranunculus paludum, commonly known as the marsh buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland environments in Europe and Asia. It typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, thriving in marshy areas and along the edges of ponds. The plant features delicate, yellow flowers with five petals, often surrounded by five sepals that resemble additional petals. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a waxy coating that helps repel water. Ranunculus paludum plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and birds."
