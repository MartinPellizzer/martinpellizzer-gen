    "intro": "Rhodocactus cubensis, commonly known as the Cuban apple cactus, is a unique cactus species native to Cuba. It is characterized by its cylindrical, segmented stems that are often ribbed and covered in small, spiny tubercles. The plant produces vibrant, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, typically blooming in the spring. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it stores water in its fleshy stems, adapting to arid environments. Rhodocactus cubensis is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in warm climates."
