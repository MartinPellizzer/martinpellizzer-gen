    "intro": "Rorippa atrovirens f. obtusula, commonly known as the narrow-leafed watercress, is a variant of the watercress species native to wetland environments. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often emerging from the water's surface. Its leaves are often used in culinary applications due to their peppery flavor. This subspecies is adapted to aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats, thriving in moist soils and shallow water."
