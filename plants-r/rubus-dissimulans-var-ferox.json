    "intro": "Rubus dissimulans var. ferox, commonly known as the serrated blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its thorny stems and dark purple to black berries that ripen in late summer. The plant has trifoliate leaves with serrated edges, and its flowers are typically white or pale pink. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and thickets. The berries are edible but have a sharp, tart flavor, making them popular in local foraging and culinary use."
