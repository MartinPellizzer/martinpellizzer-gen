It is a submerged aquatic plant with slender, branched stems and small, yellowish flowers. The species thrives in coastal areas, including salt marshes and brackish water habitats. Its leaves are narrow and ribbon-like, and it produces small, floating fruits that aid in seed dispersal. This variant is closely related to the main species Ruppia maritima and is often found in similar ecological niches."
