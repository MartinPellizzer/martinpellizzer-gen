    "intro": "Rubus suberectus var. fastigiatus, commonly known as the upright blackberry shrub, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to certain regions of Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit, which distinguishes it from the more sprawling forms of its species. The plant produces small, dark berries that are typically harvested in late summer. Its leaves are compound, consisting of three to five oval-shaped leaflets, and are covered in fine hairs. This variety is valued for both its ornamental appeal and its edible fruits, though it is less commonly cultivated than other blackberry varieties."
