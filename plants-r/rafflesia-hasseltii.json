    "intro": "Rafflesia hasseltii, commonly known as the giant Rafflesia, is a parasitic flowering plant found in the rainforests of Indonesia. It is notable for producing the world's largest individual flower, which can reach up to 1 meter in diameter. The plant lacks leaves, stems, and roots, relying entirely on its host vine for nutrients. Its flowers emit a strong, unpleasant odor resembling decaying meat, which attracts flies and other insects for pollination. The plant's unique structure and reproductive strategy make it a fascinating subject in botanical studies."
