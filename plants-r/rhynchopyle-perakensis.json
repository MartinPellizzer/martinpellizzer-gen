    "intro": "Rhynchopyle perakensis, commonly known as the Perak sand orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Malaysia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and delicate, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often near streams or in dense undergrowth. Its flowers are usually pale yellow or greenish-white, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species. Due to habitat loss, Rhynchopyle perakensis is considered vulnerable and is protected in several conservation reserves."
