    "intro": "Rubus saxicola, commonly known as the alpine raspberry, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender stems, which often grow in dense clusters on rocky or alpine terrain. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or black in color, resembling raspberries in appearance. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges and a hairy texture. Rubus saxicola is adapted to cold climates and thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils."
