    "intro": "Rafnia reflexa, commonly known as the creeping ratany, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It features heart-shaped, hairy leaves that are often lobed and can grow up to 15 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically clustered in terminal inflorescences. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Rafnia reflexa is known for its rapid growth and is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
