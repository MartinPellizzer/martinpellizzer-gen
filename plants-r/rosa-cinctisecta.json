    "intro": "Rosa cinctisecta, commonly known as the Chinese rose or the everblooming rose, is a deciduous shrub native to China. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. The leaves are compound, consisting of five to seven elliptical leaflets, and the plant produces small, red or yellow fruits known as hips. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. However, it is less commonly cultivated than other rose species due to its specific care requirements."
