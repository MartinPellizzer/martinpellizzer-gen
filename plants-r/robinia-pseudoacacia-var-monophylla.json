    "intro": "Robinia pseudoacacia var. monophylla, commonly known as the singleleaf black locust, is a variant of the black locust tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive single leaflets, unlike the typical compound leaves of the standard Robinia pseudoacacia. The plant has a rapid growth rate and is known for its hard, heavy wood, which is highly valued for construction and furniture. It produces fragrant, yellow flowers in spring, which are followed by long, flat pods containing seeds. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ecological benefits, such as soil stabilization and wildlife habitat."
