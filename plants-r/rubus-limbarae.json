    "intro": "Rubus limbarae, commonly known as the Limbarae blackberry, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America, specifically in Ecuador and Peru. The plant is characterized by its trailing growth habit, with thorny stems and compound leaves that have a serrated margin. Its flowers are small, white, and clustered in racemes, followed by dark purple berries that are edible. Due to its restricted habitat and limited distribution, Rubus limbarae is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
