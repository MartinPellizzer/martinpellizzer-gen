    "intro": "Remijia densiflora var. minima, commonly known as the dwarf denseflower remijia, is a compact, herbaceous perennial native to the wetlands of South America. It features dense clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a textured appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in marshy or swampy habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in wetland gardens."
