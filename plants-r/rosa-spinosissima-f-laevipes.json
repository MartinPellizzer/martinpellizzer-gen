    "intro": "Rosa spinosissima f. laevipes, commonly known as the smooth-stemmed prickly rose, is a cultivar of the Rosa spinosissima species. It is characterized by its thornless or nearly thornless stems, which distinguish it from the typical prickly form of its parent species. The plant produces fragrant, semi-double pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is a vigorous shrub that thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for garden cultivation. Its botanical features make it a desirable ornamental plant for landscapes and gardens."
