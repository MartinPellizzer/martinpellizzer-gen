This plant is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Rubus ursinus (the blackberry) and Rubus chamaemorus (the cloudberry). It exhibits characteristics of both parent species, featuring red to orange berries that are typically smaller than those of pure blackberries. The plant is shrub-like, with prickly stems and trifoliate leaves. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in wet, boggy areas."
