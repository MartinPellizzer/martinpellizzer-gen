    "intro": "Rosa graveolens, commonly known as the sweetbriar rose, is a shrub native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of fragrant, pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, red, berry-like fruits called hips, which are rich in vitamin C. Its leaves are compound, with five to seven leaflets, and the plant is often used in hedges or as an ornamental due to its fragrance and hardiness. Rosa graveolens is also valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
