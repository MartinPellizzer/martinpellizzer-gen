    "intro": "Rosa villosa var. montana, commonly known as the mountain roses, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of fragrant, pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has silvery-gray foliage due to dense pubescence, which helps reflect sunlight and conserve moisture. Its stems are often armed with sharp prickles, providing a natural defense against herbivores. Rosa villosa var. montana is well adapted to rocky soils and cold climates, making it a hardy and ornamental plant in gardens."
