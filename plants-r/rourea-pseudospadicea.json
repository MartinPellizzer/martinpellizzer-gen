    "intro": "Rourea pseudospadicea, commonly known as the flame tree, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, bright red or orange inflorescences that resemble flames, which bloom in clusters during the dry season. The plant has simple, opposite, ovate leaves that are usually glossy and dark green. Its flowers are typically bisexual and are surrounded by a spadix-like structure, which is a unique botanical feature. The fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that contains several seeds."
