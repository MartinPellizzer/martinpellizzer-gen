    "intro": "Rajania flexuosa, commonly known as the spiral fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, spirally arranged fronds that give it a unique and elegant appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream sides. Its rhizome is creeping and produces numerous aerial roots, which help it anchor and absorb nutrients. Rajania flexuosa is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
