    "intro": "Rhus obovata, commonly known as the smooth sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are opposite and pinnately arranged, with obovate leaflets that are typically smooth and glossy. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in panicles, followed by red, fuzzy fruit clusters that mature in the fall. Rhus obovata is often found in open woods, thickets, and along roadsides, thriving in well-drained soils. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
