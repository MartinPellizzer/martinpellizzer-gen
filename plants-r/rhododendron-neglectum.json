    "intro": "Rhododendron neglectum, commonly known as the Chinese evergreen rhododendron, is a species native to eastern Asia, particularly China, Korea, and Japan. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring dense, leathery leaves that are often dark green in color. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to form thickets and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
