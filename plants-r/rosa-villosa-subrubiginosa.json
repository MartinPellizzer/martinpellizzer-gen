It features arching stems covered in dense, white to pinkish-gray fuzzy hairs, which give it its scientific name \"villosa.\" The plant produces fragrant, pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically oval with serrated edges and turn a striking red or orange-red color in the fall. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to a variety of soil conditions."
