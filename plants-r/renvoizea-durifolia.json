    "intro": "Renvoizea durifolia, commonly known as the hard-leaved fern, is a perennial plant native to the temperate regions of South America. It is characterized by its robust, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and have a rough, textured surface. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spore-bearing cones, typical of the fern family. Its leaves are adapted to retain moisture, making it well-suited for shady, moist environments. Renvoizea durifolia is often found in forest understories and is valued for its ornamental foliage."
