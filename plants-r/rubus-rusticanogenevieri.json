    "intro": "Rubus rusticanogenevieri, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its thorny stems, trifoliate leaves, and aggregate fruits that turn from red to black as they mature. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and along stream banks. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, and it produces seeds that are dispersed by birds and mammals. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
