    "intro": "Robinia alata, commonly known as the winged acacia, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive compound leaves that are divided into pairs of oval-shaped leaflets with wing-like structures on the petioles. The tree produces yellow, fragrant flowers in early spring, which are clustered in cylindrical racemes. Its bark is smooth and grayish, becoming fissured with age, and it has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion. Robinia alata is also known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in a variety of soil types."
