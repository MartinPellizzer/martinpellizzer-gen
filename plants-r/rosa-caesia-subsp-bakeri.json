    "intro": "Rosa caesia subsp. bakeri, commonly known as the Baker's rose, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant produces oval, hairy leaves with serrated edges, typical of many rose species. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
