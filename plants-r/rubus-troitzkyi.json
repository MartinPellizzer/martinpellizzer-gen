    "intro": "Rubus troitzkyi, commonly known as the Troitzky raspberry, is a species of bramble native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its erect or spreading growth habit and produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or black in color. The plant has trifoliate leaves with serrated margins and produces white or pale pink flowers in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant in its native habitat."
