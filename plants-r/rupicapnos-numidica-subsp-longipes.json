It is characterized by its woody stems and clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to full sun. Its leaves are small, narrow, and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and visual interest."
