    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 hemianisodon, commonly known as the blackberry raspberry hybrid, is a deciduous shrub belonging to the Rosaceae family. It is a natural hybrid between Rubus ursinus (blackberry) and Rubus idaeus (raspberry), resulting in a plant that exhibits characteristics of both parents. The plant produces aggregate fruits that are typically dark red to black in color, with a distinctive raspberry-like aroma. Its leaves are serrated and alternate, with a hairy texture that helps in water retention. This hybrid is valued for its hardy nature and is often cultivated for both ornamental and culinary purposes."
