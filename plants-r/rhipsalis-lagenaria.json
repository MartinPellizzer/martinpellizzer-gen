    "intro": "Rhipsalis lagenaria, commonly known as the bottle cactus, is a member of the Cactaceae family and is native to South America. It is a climbing cactus with a unique, bottle-shaped stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by red, berry-like fruits. Its stems are often used in horticulture as a trailing plant due to its ability to grow along supports. The species is also valued for its ornamental appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
