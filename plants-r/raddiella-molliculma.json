It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in grassland and savanna habitats. The plant has small, smooth, oval-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stems. Its flowers are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences and are usually pale green to yellow in color. Raddiella molliculma is adapted to arid conditions and is drought-tolerant, making it a resilient species in its native environment."
