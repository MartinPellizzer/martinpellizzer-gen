    "intro": "Rubus hirtocaesius, commonly known as the hairy-stemmed blackberry, is a species of bramble native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its thorny stems, which are densely covered with fine hairs, and its compound leaves that are typically three to five leaflets. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that ripen to a dark purple or black color, often with a sweet and tart flavor. It thrives in moist, wooded areas and is often found in the understory of deciduous forests. Due to its hardy nature, it is a common sight in natural habitats across its range."
