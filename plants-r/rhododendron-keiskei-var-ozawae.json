    "intro": "Rhododendron keiskei var. ozawae, commonly known as the Ozawa's alpine rhododendron, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the high-altitude regions of Japan. It features dense, needle-like leaves that are typically dark green and covered in a fine, silvery bloom. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to red, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil and partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
