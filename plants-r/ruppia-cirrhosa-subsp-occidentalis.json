    "intro": "Ruppia cirrhosa subsp. occidentalis, commonly known as the western ribbonweed, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in North America. It is characterized by its long, ribbon-like leaves that are typically green to reddish in color. This subspecies thrives in shallow, nutrient-rich waters and is often found in lakes, ponds, and slow-moving rivers. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, with stamens that are often longer than the petals. The plant plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various waterfowl and invertebrates."
