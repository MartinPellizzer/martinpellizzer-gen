    "intro": "Rottlera brasiliensis, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical tree native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Rutaceae family and is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood, which is highly valued for musical instruments. The plant has compound leaves with opposite arrangement and produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or yellow. Its fruit is a drupe, containing a single seed surrounded by a fleshy pulp. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
