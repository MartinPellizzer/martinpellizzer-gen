    "intro": "Riedlea sparsiflora, commonly known as the sparse-flowered riedlea, is a species of flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many economically important plants such as coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in white or pale yellow. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and understudied species."
