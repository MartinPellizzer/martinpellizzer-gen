    "intro": "[WRONG START] Rubus vulgarus f. commutatus, commonly known as the trailing blackberry, is a variant of the common bramble. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant produces small, dark red berries that are typically less showy than those of the typical Rubus vulgaris. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the flowers are white with five petals. This form is often found in disturbed soils and along woodland edges, where it thrives in partial shade."
