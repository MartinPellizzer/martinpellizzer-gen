    "intro": "Rhododendron hunnewellianum subsp. rockii, commonly known as the Rock Island rhododendron, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It features broad, ovate leaves that are typically dark green and glossy on top, with a lighter, sometimes hairy underside. The plant produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to red, typically blooming in late spring. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and seasonal interest throughout the year."
