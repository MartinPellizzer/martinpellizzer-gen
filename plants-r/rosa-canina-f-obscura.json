    "intro": "Rosa canina f. obscura, commonly known as the dark form of the dog rose, is a botanical variant of the common dog rose, Rosa canina. It is characterized by its darker, more intense flower color compared to the typical pink or red blooms of the standard species. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits called rosehips, which are rich in vitamin C and used in traditional herbal medicine. Its leaves are compound, with five to seven leaflets, and the stems are armed with sharp thorns. This form is less commonly cultivated than the standard Rosa canina but is appreciated for its unique aesthetic and ecological value."
