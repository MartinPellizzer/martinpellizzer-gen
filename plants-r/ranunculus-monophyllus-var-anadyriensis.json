    "intro": "Ranunculus monophyllus var. anadyriensis, commonly known as the Anadyr ranunculus, is a rare and striking perennial herb native to the Arctic regions of Russia. It is characterized by its large, showy yellow flowers with a distinctive black center, which bloom in late summer. The plant has palmately divided leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, adapted to its cold, harsh environment. It thrives in moist, rocky soils and is typically found in tundra and alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
