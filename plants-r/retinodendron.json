    "intro": "Retinodendron, commonly known as the \"ghost tree,\" is a genus of flowering plants native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its unique, elongated leaves that resemble tendrils, often growing in a spiral pattern along the stems. The flowers are typically small and clustered, with a distinctive coloration that ranges from white to pale pink. Retinodendron species are often found in humid, shaded environments within the rainforest canopy. Due to their rarity and specific habitat requirements, they are considered endangered in many areas."
