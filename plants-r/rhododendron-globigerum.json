    "intro": "Rhododendron globigerum, commonly known as the globular rhododendron, is a species native to the Himalayas, particularly in regions of India and Nepal. It is a shrub characterized by its dense, rounded growth habit and evergreen foliage. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink and white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, providing a striking contrast to the colorful blooms. Rhododendron globigerum thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous regions with acidic soil."
