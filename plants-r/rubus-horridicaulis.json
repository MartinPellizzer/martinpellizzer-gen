It is characterized by its hairy, thorny stems and dark green, lobed leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers in the spring, which are followed by edible berries in the summer. Its berries are typically small, tart, and have a distinctive flavor. This plant thrives in woodland edges and disturbed soils, often forming dense thickets."
