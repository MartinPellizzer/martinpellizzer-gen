    "intro": "Raphanus candidus, commonly known as the white radish, is a flowering plant in the Brassicaceae family. It is native to southern Europe and parts of Asia, and it typically grows in dry, sandy soils. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are arranged in racemes. Its leaves are edible and have a slightly spicy flavor, similar to that of other radishes. The plant is often cultivated for its root, which is crisp and mildly peppery when eaten raw."
