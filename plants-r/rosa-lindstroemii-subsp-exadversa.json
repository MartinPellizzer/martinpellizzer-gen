    "intro": "Rosa lindstroemii subsp. exadversa, commonly known as the Lindstr\u00f6m's rose, is a subspecies native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Europe. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense, thorny stems. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink to white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the plant is well adapted to rocky and well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species in the Rosa genus."
