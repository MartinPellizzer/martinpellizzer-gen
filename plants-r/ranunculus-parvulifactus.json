    "intro": "Ranunculus parvulifactus, commonly known as the dwarf buttercup, is a small flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family, characterized by its showy, often yellow or white petals and a central cluster of stamens. The plant typically grows to a height of less than 10 centimeters, with delicate, trifoliate leaves that are hairy beneath. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is known for its early spring blooms. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
