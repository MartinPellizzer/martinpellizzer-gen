    "intro": "Rhaphidospora dichotoma, commonly known as the dichotomous fern, is a species of fern characterized by its distinctive branching pattern. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to tropical regions. The plant features fronds that are deeply divided into two equal parts, giving it its name. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce roots that help in anchoring the plant and absorbing nutrients. Rhaphidospora dichotoma is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks."
