    "intro": "Rhodanthemum quezelii subsp. quezelii, commonly known as the Quezel's rhodanthemum, is a species native to the high-altitude regions of Ethiopia. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its compact growth habit and dense foliage. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of yellow and orange, typically blooming during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
