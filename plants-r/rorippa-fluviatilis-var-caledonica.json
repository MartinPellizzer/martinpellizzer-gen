    "intro": "Rorippa fluviatilis var. caledonica, commonly known as the Scottish water-crown, is a member of the Brassicaceae family. It is a small, aquatic or semi-aquatic plant that typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. The plant features simple, alternate leaves that are often floating or submerged, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Its flowers are small, yellow, and arranged in clusters, typical of the mustard family. It plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and small aquatic organisms."
