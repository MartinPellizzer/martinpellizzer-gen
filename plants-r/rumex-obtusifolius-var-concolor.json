    "intro": "Rumex obtusifolius var. concolor, commonly known as broad-leaved dock, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features large, broad, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a waxy layer, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish flowers that are borne on erect, branched stems. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along riverbanks. Its leaves are edible and have been used in traditional herbal remedies for their purported health benefits."
