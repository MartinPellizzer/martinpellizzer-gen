    "intro": "Rubus tomentosus var. edentatus, commonly known as the rough blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to parts of North America. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, rough texture. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically edible but have a tart flavor. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and thickets. Its botanical features make it identifiable from other Rubus species, particularly due to the absence of teeth on its leaf margins."
