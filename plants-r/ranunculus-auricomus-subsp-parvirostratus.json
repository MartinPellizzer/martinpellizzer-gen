It features striking yellow flowers with five to nine broadly lanceolate petals, often with a distinctive beak-like tip. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks. Its leaves are palmately divided with serrated edges, and it produces achenes as its fruits.
