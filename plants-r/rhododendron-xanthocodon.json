    "intro": "Rhododendron xanthocodon, commonly known as the yellow rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its showy, funnel-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often with a red or purple throat. The plant typically grows as an evergreen shrub, reaching heights of up to 3 meters, and prefers acidic, well-drained soils. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, providing a striking contrast to its vibrant blossoms. Rhododendron xanthocodon is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in cooler, humid climates."
