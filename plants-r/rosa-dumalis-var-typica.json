    "intro": "Rosa dumalis var. typica, commonly known as the alpine rose, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with thornless stems and dark green, ovate leaves. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, pink to red flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and alpine settings."
