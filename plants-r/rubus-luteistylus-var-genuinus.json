    "intro": "Rubus luteistylus var. genuinus, commonly known as the golden-styled raspberry, is a rare and less commonly studied variant of the Rubus genus. It is characterized by its yellowish stigmas, which distinguish it from other raspberry species. The plant typically grows in temperate regions with moist, well-drained soils, often in forested areas. Its flowers are usually pink to white, and the fruit, while edible, is smaller and less flavorful compared to common raspberries. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare species in botanical collections."
