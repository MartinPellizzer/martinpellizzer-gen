    "intro": "Rubus glandulosohirtus, commonly known as the hairy bramble, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its thorny stems and trifoliate leaves, which are typically covered in fine, glandular hairs. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red or black berries in the fall. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges, hedgerows, and disturbed soils. Due to its aggressive growth habit, it can become invasive in certain regions."
