    "intro": "Rubus divaricatus f. ferocissimus, commonly known as the fierce blackberry, is a variant of the trailing blackberry species native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its thorny stems and dark, almost black berries that mature in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and thickets. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and its flowers are small, white, and clustered in the axils of the leaves. The fruit is edible but often has a strong, tart flavor, making it popular among certain wildlife species."
