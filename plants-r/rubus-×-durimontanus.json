It is native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States and is characterized by its thorny stems and dark purple to black berries. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and streamside areas. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and its flowers are white with five petals. The fruit is edible, though often tart, and is used in local culinary traditions."
