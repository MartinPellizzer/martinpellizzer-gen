    "intro": "Rubus plicatus var. dissectus, commonly known as the dissected blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant characterized by its finely lobed leaves and thorny stems. It is native to the eastern United States and thrives in moist, wooded areas. The plant produces small, dark purple berries that are typically smaller than those of common blackberries. Its foliage is often described as having a delicate, lace-like appearance due to the deep, intricate leaf divisions. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
