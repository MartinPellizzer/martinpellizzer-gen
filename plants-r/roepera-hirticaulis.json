    "intro": "Roepera hirticaulis, commonly known as the hairy-stemmed roepera, is a species of flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. Its hairy stems and leaves are adaptations to reduce water loss in its native habitat. Roepera hirticaulis is often found in open grasslands and along the edges of shrublands."
