    "intro": "Rossolis rotundifolia, commonly known as the round-leaf rossolis, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its round or oval-shaped leaves, which are often covered in a fine layer of hair. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
