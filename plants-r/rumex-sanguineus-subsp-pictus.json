    "intro": "Rumex sanguineus subsp. pictus, commonly known as the blood-red sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive reddish stems and leaves with a tangy, sour taste due to the presence of oxalic acid. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. Its flowers are small and clustered in spikes, producing a showy display in the spring. The subspecies pictus is distinguished by its vivid red coloration and unique leaf patterns, making it a notable ornamental and ecological plant."
