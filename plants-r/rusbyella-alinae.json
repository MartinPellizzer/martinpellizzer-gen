    "intro": "Rusbyella alinae, commonly known as the Alina's Rusbyella, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of a specific island in the South Pacific. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae, characterized by its bell-shaped flowers. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom during the cooler months, typically from September to November. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, silvery hair, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Rusbyella alinae is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
