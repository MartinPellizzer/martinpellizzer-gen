    "intro": "Rhinanthus bipinnatifidus, commonly known as the two-lobed yellow rattle, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, known for its hemiparasitic nature, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients. The plant produces showy yellow flowers with five lobes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and heaths, often found in nutrient-poor soils. Due to its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its rarity in some regions, it is of conservation interest."
