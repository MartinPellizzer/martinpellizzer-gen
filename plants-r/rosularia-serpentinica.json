    "intro": "Rosularia serpentinica, commonly known as the serpentinite rose or serpentine rose, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and produces small, showy flowers in shades of pink and white. The plant thrives in poor, well-drained soils, often found on rocky or limestone substrates. Its leaves are typically gray-green, covered in a dense layer of fine, hair-like structures that help reduce water loss. Rosularia serpentinica is adapted to harsh, dry environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance requirements."
