    "intro": "Rubus hispidus, commonly known as the bristly blackberry, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa, and is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, dark berries. The plant produces white to pale yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by the edible fruits in late summer. Its leaves are typically trifoliate, with serrated edges and a hairy texture. Rubus hispidus is often found in hedgerows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade."
