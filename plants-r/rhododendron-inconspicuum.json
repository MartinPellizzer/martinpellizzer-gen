    "intro": "Rhododendron inconspicuum, commonly known as the dwarf rhododendron, is a compact evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring dense, leathery leaves that are dark green and glossy. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It prefers acidic, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its slow growth and ornamental value make it a popular choice for rock gardens and as a ground cover in shaded areas."
