    "intro": "Rosa pendulina var. praealpina, commonly known as the Alpine pendulous rose, is a rare and delicate species native to the alpine regions of Central Europe. It is characterized by its slender, arching stems and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it forms a low, spreading shrub. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are usually pink or white. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
