    "intro": "Rubus radulispinus, commonly known as the spiny raspberry, is a species of bramble native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its thorny stems and aggregate fruits, which are typically red or orange when ripe. The plant produces compound leaves with serrated edges and small, white flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed areas. The berries are edible, though some varieties may have a tart or sharp flavor."
