It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. Its fruits, which are typically small and somewhat tart, develop in the summer and are often used in local foraging. Botanically, it belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is closely related to other brambles such as Rubus idaeus."
