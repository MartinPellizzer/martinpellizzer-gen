    "intro": "Roella cuspidata var. hispida, commonly known as the hairy roella, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features slender, erect stems that are often covered in fine, stiff hairs, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. Its leaves are narrow and linear, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. This species is adapted to grow in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in coastal or semi-arid regions."
