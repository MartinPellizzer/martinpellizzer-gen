    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus subsp. linkolae, commonly known as the Linkolai buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the western United States. It features showy, yellow flowers with five to seven petals that resemble a cup, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three deeply lobed leaflets, and it has a short, upright stem. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly smaller flowers and narrower leaves compared to the typical form of *R. auricomus*."
