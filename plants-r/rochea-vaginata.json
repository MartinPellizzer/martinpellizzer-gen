    "intro": "Rochea vaginata, commonly known as the velvetleaf or false velvetleaf, is a herbaceous plant native to South America. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Rochea vaginata is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or along riverbanks. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and sometimes invasive species in certain regions."
