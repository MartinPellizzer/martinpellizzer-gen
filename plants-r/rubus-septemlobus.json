    "intro": "Rubus septemlobus, commonly known as the seven-lobed blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the western United States. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with seven lobes, which give it its scientific name. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black in color. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, loamy soils. Rubus septemlobus is often found in woodland edges, thickets, and disturbed sites, where it plays a role in ecological succession."
