    "intro": "Rubus segobricensis, commonly known as the Segobric mountain raspberry, is a species of bramble native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It is characterized by its trailing or climbing growth habit, with thorny stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or yellow when ripe. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in forested or rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its range."
