    "intro": "Rosa pomifera f. anoplantha, commonly known as the giant rose or the woolly rose, is a unique botanical variant characterized by its large, fuzzy, fruit-like structures called rose hips. This form is a fasciation variant of Rosa pomifera, which is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. The plant exhibits a sprawling growth habit with thick, woody stems and large, ovate leaves covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair. The flowers are typically pink or red, and the fruit develops into a large, round, hairy structure that can reach up to 10 centimeters in diameter. Due to its distinctive appearance, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in gardens and botanical collections."
