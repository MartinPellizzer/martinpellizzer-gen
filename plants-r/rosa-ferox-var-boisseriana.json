    "intro": "Rosa ferox var. boisseriana, commonly known as the Boissier's wild rose, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of fragrant, pink to red flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, orange-red hips that are rich in vitamin C. Its leaves are dark green, serrated, and arranged alternately along the stems. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in temperate climates."
