    "intro": "Rotala submersa var. angustipetala, commonly known as narrow-leaf water hyssop, is a submerged aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It has slender, branching stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly in aquatic environments. Its leaves are narrow and elongated, typically with a dark green color and a slight waxy coating. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers that are often submerged, making them less visible. It is commonly used in aquariums for its aesthetic value and ability to provide habitat for aquatic life."
