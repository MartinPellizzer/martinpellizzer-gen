    "intro": "Ricinus communis f. americanus, commonly known as the American castor plant, is a variant of the castor oil plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves and distinctive spiny seed capsules. The plant produces toxic seeds that contain ricin, a potent toxin, making it dangerous to handle. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Despite its toxicity, it is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its striking foliage."
