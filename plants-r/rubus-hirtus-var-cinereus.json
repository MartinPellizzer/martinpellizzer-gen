It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red or black berries in the fall. It thrives in moist, woodland environments and is often found in shaded areas. The grayish pubescence on its stems and leaves gives it a distinctive appearance."
