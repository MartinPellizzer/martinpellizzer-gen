    "intro": "Rhaphidanthe, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, elongated leaves and a single, showy flower that often appears without foliage. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its unique appearance and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Rhaphidanthe faces significant threats to its survival."
