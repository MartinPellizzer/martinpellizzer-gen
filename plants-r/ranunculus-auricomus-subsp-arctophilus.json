    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus subsp. arctophilus, commonly known as the Arctic buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features showy, bright yellow flowers with five to eight broad, petal-like sepals that resemble petals. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils in high-altitude environments. Its leaves are palmately divided and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold climates. The species is adapted to harsh conditions, with a short growing season and a reliance on snowmelt for moisture."
