    "intro": "Rumex nepalensis var. andreaeanus, commonly known as the Nepal sorrel, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Nepal and northern India. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive reddish coloration on the underside, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a resilient species in its native habitat. The leaves are edible and have been used in traditional cuisines for their tangy flavor."
