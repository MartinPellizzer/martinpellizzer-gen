    "intro": "Reaumuria kaschgarica var. przewalskii, commonly known as the Przewalski's sandthorn, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and spiny, woody stems that help it survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant has small, leathery leaves that reduce water loss, adapting it to its semi-desert habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sandy or rocky areas. This variant is noted for its resilience to extreme temperatures and low precipitation."
