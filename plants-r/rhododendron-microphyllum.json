    "intro": "Rhododendron microphyllum, commonly known as the dwarf rhododendron, is a compact evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It features dense, leathery leaves that are small and elliptical, typically less than 2 inches in length. The plant produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to form thickets, providing habitat for wildlife in its natural environment."
