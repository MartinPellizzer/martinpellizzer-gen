    "intro": "Rosa arvensis var. pilifolia, commonly known as the hairy dog rose, is a perennial shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often thorned stems and small, pale pink to white flowers. The leaves are trifoliate, with hairy surfaces that give the plant its common name. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and along riverbanks. The plant produces rosehips that are used in traditional herbal remedies."
