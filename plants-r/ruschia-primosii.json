    "intro": "Ruschia primosii, commonly known as the firecracker plant, is a succulent native to South Africa. It features compact, upright growth with dense clusters of bright orange to red tubular flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that store water, typical of succulents, and it thrives in well-drained soil. It prefers full sun and is drought-tolerant once established. Its striking flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting."
