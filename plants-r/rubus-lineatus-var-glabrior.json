    "intro": "Rubus lineatus var. glabrior, commonly known as the smooth blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to North America. It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous stems and leaves, distinguishing it from other Rubus species. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically smaller than those of common blackberries. It thrives in moist, fertile soils and is often found in woodland edges and thickets. The smooth blackberry is valued for its edible fruits and is sometimes cultivated for its unique flavor and appearance."
