    "intro": "Reynoldsia sandwicensis var. intercedens, commonly known as the Maui rain tree, is a rare endemic species native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a small, deciduous tree characterized by its compound leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is typically found in coastal and lowland habitats. It plays an important ecological role in its native environment, providing habitat and nectar for native pollinators. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
