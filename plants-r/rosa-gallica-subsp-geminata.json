    "intro": "Rosa gallica subsp. geminata, commonly known as the double-flowered Gallica rose, is a subspecies native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and its ability to produce dense clusters of double flowers in shades of red, pink, and white. The leaves are typically dark green, glossy, and arranged oppositely along the stems. This plant is well-suited for garden cultivation due to its hardiness and ornamental value. It also has a long history of use in perfumery and as a symbol of love and devotion in various cultures."
