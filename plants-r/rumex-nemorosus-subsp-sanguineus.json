    "intro": "Rumex nemorosus subsp. sanguineus, commonly known as the red sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features basal leaves that are heart-shaped with a reddish-purple underside, and it produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in spring. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their astringent properties. The subspecies is distinguished by its more intensely colored foliage compared to the typical R. nemorosus."
