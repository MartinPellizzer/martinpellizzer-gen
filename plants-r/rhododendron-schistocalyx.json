    "intro": "Rhododendron schistocalyx, commonly known as the rock rhododendron, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of showy, tubular flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires partial to full sunlight. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, often with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Rhododendron schistocalyx is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a landscape plant in suitable climates."
