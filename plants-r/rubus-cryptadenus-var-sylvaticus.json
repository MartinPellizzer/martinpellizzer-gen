    "intro": "Rubus cryptadenus var. sylvaticus, commonly known as the red-berried blackberry, is a shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It produces small, dark red fruits that are typically harvested in late summer. The plant has compound leaves with serrated edges and thorny stems, typical of many Rubus species. It thrives in woodland areas and prefers well-drained soils. The berries are edible but often have a tart flavor, making them suitable for jams and preserves."
