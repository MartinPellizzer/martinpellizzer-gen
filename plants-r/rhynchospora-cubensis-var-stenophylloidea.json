    "intro": "Rhynchospora cubensis var. stenophylloidea, commonly known as the narrow-leaf marsh sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of the Caribbean, particularly Cuba and the Florida Keys. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and compact inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, often in marshy or swampy habitats, and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, arranged in spikelets, and it plays a role in supporting local biodiversity by providing habitat and food for various insects and birds."
