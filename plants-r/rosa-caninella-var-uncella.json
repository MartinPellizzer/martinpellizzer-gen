    "intro": "Rosa caninella var. uncella, commonly known as the small dog rose, is a rare and delicate species of flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, fragrant pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces rose hips, which are small, red, berry-like fruits containing seeds. Its leaves are pinnate, with five to seven leaflets, and the stems are covered in soft, glandular hairs. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a botanical curiosity and is often found in rocky or dry soils."
