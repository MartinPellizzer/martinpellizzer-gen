    "intro": "Ranunculus adamastus, commonly known as the alpine buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It features a basal rosette of finely toothed, lobed leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of white hairs. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with five to eight petals, often adorned with a distinctive central blotch. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain areas."
