It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces delicate, yellowish-green flowers with a distinctive, twisted structure. The subspecies is characterized by its reduced floral features compared to the typical form, giving it a more subdued appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to cultivate in suitable conditions."
