    "intro": "Rorippa palustris var. pacifica, commonly known as Pacific watercress, is a herbaceous annual plant native to coastal regions of North America. It thrives in wet, saline environments such as tidal marshes and brackish streams. The plant has alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating to reduce water loss. Its small, white flowers are arranged in clusters and bloom from late spring to early summer. The seeds are dispersed by water, allowing the plant to colonize new areas along shorelines."
