    "intro": "Rheum tanguticum, commonly known as the Tibetan rhubarb, is a perennial plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas and Central Asia. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in the spring. Its roots are the primary part used, containing high concentrations of anthraquinones, which have medicinal properties. Rheum tanguticum is also valued for its use in traditional herbal medicine and as a source of natural dyes."
