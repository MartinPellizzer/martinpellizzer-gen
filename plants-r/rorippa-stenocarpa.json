    "intro": "Rorippa stenocarpa, commonly known as narrow-fruited watercress, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in wetlands, stream margins, and other moist environments, often forming dense mats on the water surface. The plant has alternate, ovate leaves that are usually submerged or floating, with small, white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fruits are small, capsule-like structures that release tiny seeds when mature. Rorippa stenocarpa is known for its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed aquatic habitats."
