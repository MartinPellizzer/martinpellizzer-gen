    "intro": "Rotala kainantensis, commonly known as the Kainantensis waterwheel plant, is a species of floating aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It features whorled leaves that are typically dark green and oval-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps it float on water. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, adding ornamental value to ponds and water gardens. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments and is often used in aquascaping due to its aesthetic appeal. Rotala kainantensis is also valued for its ability to provide habitat for aquatic life and improve water clarity."
