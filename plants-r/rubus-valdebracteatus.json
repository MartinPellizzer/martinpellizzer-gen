    "intro": "Rubus valdebracteatus, commonly known as the bracted raspberry, is a species of shrub native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red when ripe, similar to other raspberries in the Rubus genus. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and partial shade. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and less-studied species within its ecological community."
