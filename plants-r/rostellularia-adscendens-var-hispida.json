    "intro": "Rostellularia adscendens var. hispida, commonly known as the hairy climbing rosette, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its climbing habit and rosette-like growth pattern, with thick, fleshy stems and leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its hairy texture, from which the variety name derives, is a distinguishing feature. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in warm climates."
