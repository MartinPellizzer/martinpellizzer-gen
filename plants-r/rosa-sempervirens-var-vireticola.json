    "intro": "Rosa sempervirens var. vireticola, commonly known as the evergreen rose, is a compact, shrub-like plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage that remains lush throughout the year, giving it its \"evergreen\" name. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white to pale pink, typically appearing in spring. It is well-suited for coastal climates due to its tolerance of salt spray and well-drained soils. Its ornamental value lies in its year-round foliage and delicate floral display."
