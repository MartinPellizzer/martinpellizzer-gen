It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, showy red flowers that bloom throughout the year. The leaves are typically oval-shaped with a smooth texture and a slightly glossy appearance. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its vibrant floral display."
