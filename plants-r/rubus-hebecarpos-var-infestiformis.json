    "intro": "Rubus hebecarpos var. infestiformis, commonly known as the creeping blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to parts of eastern North America. It is a shrub characterized by its trailing growth habit and thorny stems, which help it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, dark red berries that are typically less showy than other blackberry varieties. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three leaflets that are oval-shaped and have serrated edges. This species is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and along stream banks."
