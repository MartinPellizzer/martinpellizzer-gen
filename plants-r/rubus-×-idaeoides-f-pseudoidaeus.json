    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 idaeoides f. pseudoidaeus, commonly known as the Pacific blackberry, is a hybrid species within the Rubus genus, characterized by its thorny stems and aggregate fruits. It is native to the western United States and parts of Canada, thriving in coastal and riparian habitats. The plant produces dark purple to black berries that are typically small and covered in a fine, white bloom. Its foliage is usually trifoliate, with serrated leaflets and a hairy texture. The species is valued for its ornamental qualities and has some edible uses, though its fruits are generally less palatable than those of other blackberry varieties."
