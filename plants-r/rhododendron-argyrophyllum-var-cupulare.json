It is characterized by its lance-shaped, silvery-white to gray-green leaves that are densely covered with fine, woolly hairs. The plant produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to red, typically blooming in late spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments with acidic soil and partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
