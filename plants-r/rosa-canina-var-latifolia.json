    "intro": "Rosa canina var. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved dog rose, is a variety of the dog rose species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves and fragrant, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces red, hairy berries that are edible but often used in jams and jellies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy shrub suitable for hedgerows and gardens. This variety is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, supporting pollinators and wildlife."
