    "intro": "Rosa villosa var. discolor, commonly known as the fuzzy pink rose, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its soft, fuzzy stems and broad, lobed leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces fragrant, semi-double flowers that range in color from pale pink to white, with a distinct discoloration in the center. It thrives in partial to full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for gardeners. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its unique foliage and seasonal interest, particularly in autumn when the leaves turn a striking red or orange."
