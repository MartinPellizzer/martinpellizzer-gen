    "intro": "Rhus engleriana, commonly known as the Brazilian sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically pinnate with 7 to 15 leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by red, fuzzy fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions. Rhus engleriana is often used in ornamental horticulture due to its attractive foliage and seasonal color changes."
