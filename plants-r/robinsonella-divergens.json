    "intro": "Robinsonella divergens, commonly known as the divergent lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Roccellaceae. It is characterized by its crustose growth form, forming a thin, often uneven layer on rock surfaces. The thallus is typically pale yellow to orange in color, with a granular texture. It is commonly found in humid, shaded environments, particularly on calcareous substrates. This lichen is known for its chemical composition, which includes various secondary metabolites that contribute to its ecological role in nutrient cycling."
