    "intro": "Rubus obscurus subsp. obscurissimus, commonly known as the dark bramble, is a shrub native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, thorny growth and dark green, leathery leaves. The flowers are small, typically pink or white, and appear in clusters during the spring. The plant produces black, tart berries that are edible but often used in jams and wines. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas."
