    "intro": "Rubus saxatilis aculeatus, commonly known as the brambles or blackberries, is a species of flowering plant in the rose family. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves, which are typically arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that ripen to a dark purple or black color, often consumed by both wildlife and humans. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, sunny environments. This shrub is often found in hedgerows, woodland edges, and disturbed sites across temperate regions."
