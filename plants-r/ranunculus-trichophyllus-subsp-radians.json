    "intro": "Ranunculus trichophyllus subsp. radians, commonly known as the creeping buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its basal leaves that are deeply lobed and its clusters of small, yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, riverbanks, and woodland edges. It has a creeping rhizome that allows it to spread and form dense mats, which can make it invasive in certain environments."
