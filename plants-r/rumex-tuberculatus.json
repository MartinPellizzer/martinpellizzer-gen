    "intro": "Rumex tuberculatus, commonly known as the rough dock, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features basal leaves that are broadly ovate with a wavy margin and a hairy surface, while the upper leaves are more lanceolate. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in dense clusters during the summer months. Its roots are fibrous and can form a dense mat, making it a common weed in disturbed soils. Rumex tuberculatus is often found in moist environments such as meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks."
