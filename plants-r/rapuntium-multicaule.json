It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with numerous small, clustered stems. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by heart-shaped, edible leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its leaves and flowers are often used in culinary applications, adding a peppery flavor to dishes."
