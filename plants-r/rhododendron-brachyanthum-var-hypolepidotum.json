    "intro": "Rhododendron brachyanthum var. hypolepidotum, commonly known as the dwarf alpine rhododendron, is a compact evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of China. It features dense, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and slightly glossy, with a narrow, ovate shape. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to purple, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and requires a cool, humid climate. This variety is well-suited for rock gardens and alpine settings due to its low-growing habit and ornamental value."
