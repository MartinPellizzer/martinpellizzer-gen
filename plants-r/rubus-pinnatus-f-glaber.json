    "intro": "Rubus pinnatus f. glaber, commonly known as the smooth-leafed blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant characterized by its smooth, hairless leaves. It is a shrub native to the eastern United States, typically found in moist, wooded areas. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are edible and often used in jams and desserts. Its foliage is dense and provides habitat for various insects and small animals. The smooth leaf surface distinguishes it from other Rubus species, making it easily identifiable in the wild."
