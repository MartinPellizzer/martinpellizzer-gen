    "intro": "Rafflesia azlanii, commonly known as the Bornean rafflesia, is a parasitic plant found in the rainforests of Borneo. It is renowned for producing the world's largest individual flower, which can reach up to 3 feet in diameter. The plant lacks leaves, stems, and roots, relying entirely on its host, the Tetrastigma vine, for nutrients. Its flowers emit a strong, foul odor resembling decaying flesh to attract pollinators like flies and carrion beetles. Despite its striking appearance, Rafflesia azlanii is rare and faces threats from habitat destruction and illegal collection."
