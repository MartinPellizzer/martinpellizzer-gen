    "intro": "Rubus radula proles venustus, commonly known as the velvet-leaf blackberry, is a rare and ornamental species belonging to the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its dark purple, velvety leaves and clusters of small, edible blackberries that ripen in late summer. The plant thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and partial shade. Its unique foliage and berries make it a sought-after addition to botanical gardens. However, due to its limited distribution, it is considered endangered in the wild."
