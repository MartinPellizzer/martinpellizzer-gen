    "intro": "Rubus inclinabilis, commonly known as the bent-leaf blackberry, is a species of bramble native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and the presence of serrated, hairy leaves. The plant produces small, dark purple berries that are typically harvested in the fall. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and thickets. Due to its invasive tendencies, it can outcompete native vegetation in certain regions."
