    "intro": "Ricinus communis f. canatus, commonly known as the crimson or scarlet castor plant, is a variant of the castor oil plant characterized by its striking, vibrant red bracts. It is a flowering plant in the spurge family, Euphorbiaceae, and is native to tropical regions of Africa. The plant produces capsule fruits containing toxic seeds, which are used in traditional medicine and as a source of castor oil. Its ornamental value comes from the showy, colorful bracts that surround the small yellow flowers. This cultivar is often grown in gardens for its visual appeal and is relatively easy to care for in suitable climates."
