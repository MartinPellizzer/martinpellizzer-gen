It is characterized by its distinctive reverse bloom pattern, where the petals open inward rather than outward. The plant features thorny stems and dark green, serrated leaves typical of the Rosa genus. Its flowers are usually pink to red in color and bloom in late spring to early summer. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its visual interest."
