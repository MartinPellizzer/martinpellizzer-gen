    "intro": "Rhynchosia adenodes, commonly known as the African velvet bean, is a climbing legume native to tropical Africa. It features compound leaves with small, ovate leaflets and produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences. The plant bears pods that contain edible seeds, which are rich in protein and used in various traditional cuisines. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed habitats such as fallows and roadside areas. Rhynchosia adenodes also has medicinal uses in some traditional systems, though its potential toxicity requires caution in use."
