    "intro": "Rosa humifusa, commonly known as the creeping rose, is a low-growing shrub native to eastern North America. It features dense, thornless stems that hug the ground, forming a mat-like structure. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are compound, consisting of five to seven oval-shaped leaflets, and are covered in fine hairs. Rosa humifusa is well adapted to moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and stream banks."
