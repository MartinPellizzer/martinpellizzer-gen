    "intro": "Rubus tomentosus subf. sterilis, commonly known as the silver-leaved blackberry, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and large, pale green leaves covered in a fine, woolly pubescence. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by edible berries in the summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and riparian areas. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and ecologically important species in its native habitat."
