    "intro": "Raffenaldia primuloides subvar. leiocarpa, commonly known as the white-flowered raffenaldia, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its leaves are broad, ovate, and covered in a fine, soft pubescence. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
