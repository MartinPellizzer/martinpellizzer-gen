    "intro": "Roella glomerata, commonly known as the clustered roella, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes buckwheats and sedges. The plant is characterized by its dense clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that appear in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and arranged in a basal rosette, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Roella glomerata is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments."
