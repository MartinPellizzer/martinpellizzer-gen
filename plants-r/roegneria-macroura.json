It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and long, narrow leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces spike-like inflorescences with small, two-lobed florets, which are wind-pollinated. Roegneria macroura is often found in open habitats such as meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping and erosion control."
