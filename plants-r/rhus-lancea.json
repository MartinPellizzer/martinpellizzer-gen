    "intro": "Rhus lancea, commonly known as the lanceleaf sumac, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves, which are typically 3 to 5 inches long and have a smooth, glossy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by red, fuzzy berries that attract birds and other wildlife. Rhus lancea thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in open woods, thickets, and along stream banks. Its hardy nature makes it a common sight in many eastern woodlands."
