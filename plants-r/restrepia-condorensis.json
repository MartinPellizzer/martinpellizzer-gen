    "intro": "Restrepia condorensis, commonly known as the Condor orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the high-altitude regions of southern Peru. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its compact, pseudobulbous structure and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at elevations above 3,000 meters. Its flowers, which are usually pink or purple, bloom during the summer months and are adapted to the cool, humid conditions of its mountainous habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a vulnerable species."
