    "intro": "Roupala tomentosa var. geminata, commonly known as the silver tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, silvery-gray foliage, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by spherical, woody fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or rocky habitats. The variety geminata is notable for its tendency to produce twin leaves, which is a key distinguishing feature."
