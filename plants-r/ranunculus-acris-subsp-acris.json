    "intro": "Ranunculus acris subsp. acris, commonly known as the common buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa. It features bright yellow flowers with 5 to 15 sepals that resemble petals, and its leaves are deeply lobed with a hairy texture. The plant typically grows in moist meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges, thriving in temperate climates. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in spring, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. The species is characterized by its toxic sap, which contains protoanemonin, a compound that can cause skin irritation."
