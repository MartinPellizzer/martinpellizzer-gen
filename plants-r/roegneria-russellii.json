    "intro": "Roegneria russellii, commonly known as Russell's wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as a forage crop or for ornamental purposes."
