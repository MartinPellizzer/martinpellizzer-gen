    "intro": "Ranunculus karelicus, commonly known as the Karelian buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the forested regions of northern Europe and parts of Asia. It features delicate, palmately divided leaves and bright yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in early spring. The plant prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and it produces small, dry fruits that disperse seeds through wind. Ranunculus karelicus is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and naturalized areas."
