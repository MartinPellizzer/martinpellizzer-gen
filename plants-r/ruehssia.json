    "intro": "Ruehssia, commonly known as the \"southern cross\" or \"silver leaf,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Araliaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly in areas with humid climates. The plants typically have compound leaves with a distinctive silver or grayish coloration on the underside, which gives them their common name. Ruehssia species are often cultivated for their ornamental value due to their attractive foliage and small, clustered flowers. They prefer well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making them suitable for both indoor and outdoor cultivation."
