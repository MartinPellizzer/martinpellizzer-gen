    "intro": "Rumex trifidus, commonly known as three-lobed sorrel, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features alternate, trifid (three-lobed) leaves that are typically heart-shaped with a reddish or purple underside. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its leaves are edible but contain oxalic acid, which can be harmful in large quantities."
