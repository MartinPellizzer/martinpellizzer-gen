    "intro": "Rubus horridus var. lejeunei, commonly known as the prickly blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and dark purple to black berries that ripen in late summer. The plant typically grows in woodlands, hedgerows, and disturbed soils, preferring moist to moderately dry conditions. Its leaves are compound, with three to five oval leaflets, and the flowers are white with five petals. The fruit is edible but has a tart flavor, often used in jams and preserves."
