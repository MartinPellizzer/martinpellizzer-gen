    "intro": "Rhacoma nana, commonly known as the dwarf rhacoma, is a small, herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It typically grows to a height of less than 10 centimeters, with compact, succulent leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the cooler months, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are adapted to store water, making it highly drought-resistant. Rhacoma nana is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited to xerophytic environments."
