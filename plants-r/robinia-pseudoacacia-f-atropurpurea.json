    "intro": "Robinia pseudoacacia f. atropurpurea, commonly known as the purple-leaf false acacia, is a striking variation of the honey locust tree. This ornamental tree is characterized by its dark purple to bronze foliage, which provides a dramatic visual contrast to its typical green leaves. It produces long, drooping pods that contain flat, edible seeds, and its flowers are yellow and appear in clusters. The tree is native to the southeastern United States but is widely cultivated for its ornamental value. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for landscapes and gardens."
