    "intro": "Ranunculus arvensis var. echinatissimus, commonly known as the echinately hairy buttercup, is a variant of the field buttercup native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a herbaceous perennial with a basal rosette of leaves and produces showy yellow flowers with prominent, hooked sepals. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which help distinguish it from other ranunculus species. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in cultivated fields. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain environments."
