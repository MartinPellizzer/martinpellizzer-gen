    "intro": "Rhacoma vildosolaeanum, commonly known as the Vildosola's rhacoma, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Central America. It is characterized by its striking, spiral-arranged leaves that are broad and lance-shaped, often with a waxy texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of yellow and orange, which bloom during the wet season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
