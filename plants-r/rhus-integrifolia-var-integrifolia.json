It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically composed of 11 to 31 serrated leaflets. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by red, fuzzy fruits that are a common food source for birds. Its bark is smooth and grayish, and it thrives in well-drained soils in full sun. The plant is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to tolerate various environmental conditions."
