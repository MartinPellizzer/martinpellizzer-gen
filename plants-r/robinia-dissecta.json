    "intro": "Robinia dissecta, commonly known as the fragrant caragana, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are divided into numerous narrow, feather-like segments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom in early spring before the leaves emerge. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, often peeling in thin, papery layers. Robinia dissecta is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands and along streambanks."
