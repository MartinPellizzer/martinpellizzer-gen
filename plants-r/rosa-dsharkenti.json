    "intro": "Rosa dsharkenti, commonly known as the Dsharkenti rose, is a rare and ornamental species native to the mountainous regions of Eastern Europe. It is characterized by its fragrant, semi-double flowers that range in color from pale pink to deep red. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with thorny stems and dark green, serrated leaves. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it prefers well-drained, loamy soil in full sun. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
