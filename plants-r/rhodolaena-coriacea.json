    "intro": "Rhodolaena coriacea, commonly known as the rough-leaved rhodolaena, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are often covered in a whitish, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or red, adding visual interest during the flowering season. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and by horticulturists."
