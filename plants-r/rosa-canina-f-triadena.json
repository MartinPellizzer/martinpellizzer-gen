    "intro": "Rosa canina f. triadena, commonly known as the three-lobed dog rose, is a botanical variant of the common dog rose. It is characterized by its distinctive three-lobed leaves, which set it apart from the typical single-lobed leaves of the species. The flowers are usually pink to red, with five petals, and bloom in spring. It is a shrub that produces hips, which are the fruit of the plant and are used in traditional medicine. This form is less commonly cultivated but is of interest to botanists and horticultural enthusiasts."
