    "intro": "Rosa tomentella var. sepioides, commonly known as the Sepia-hued Rose, is a rare and ornamental shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California. It is characterized by its dense, silvery-gray foliage and small, fragrant pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in coastal scrub habitats. Its unique coloration and compact growth make it a desirable addition to gardens with suitable conditions. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
