    "intro": "Rubus vesprimiensis, commonly known as the Vesprimien raspberry, is a species of bramble native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red when ripe, similar to other raspberry species. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and full sunlight. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
