    "intro": "Ribes sibiricum, commonly known as Siberian gooseberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows to a height of 1\u20132 meters and is characterized by its thorny stems and alternate, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during late spring, which are followed by edible, red berries in the fall. These berries are rich in vitamin C and have been used historically for culinary and medicinal purposes. Ribes sibiricum thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats."
