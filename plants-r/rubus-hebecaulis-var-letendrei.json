    "intro": "Rubus hebecaulis var. letendrei, commonly known as the slender blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its thin, wiry stems and small, dark purple berries that ripen in late summer. The plant produces trifoliate leaves with serrated edges, typical of the Rubus genus. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial shade, often growing in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
