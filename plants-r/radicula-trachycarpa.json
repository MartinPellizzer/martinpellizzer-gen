    "intro": "Radicula trachycarpa, commonly known as the rough-seeded radicula, is a small, annual flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many economically important crops such as cabbage and mustard. The plant is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, green, ovate leaves that are covered in fine, stiff hairs. Its flowers are typically small, yellowish, and arranged in clusters, and it produces small, dry, capsule-like fruits. Due to its hardy nature, it is often found in disturbed soils and can be a pioneer species in ecological succession."
