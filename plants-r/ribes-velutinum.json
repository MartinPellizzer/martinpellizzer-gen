It belongs to the genus Ribes in the family Grossulariaceae, which includes other species of gooseberries and currants. The plant is characterized by its smooth, often reddish stems and clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are simple, ovate, and have a velvety texture, giving it its scientific name. The fruit, which ripens in late summer, is a small, edible berry with a tart flavor."
