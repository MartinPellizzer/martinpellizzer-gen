    "intro": "Rhododendron pocophorum, commonly known as the dwarf rhododendron, is a compact evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring dense, leathery leaves that are dark green in color. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to form thickets, providing habitat for various wildlife species."
