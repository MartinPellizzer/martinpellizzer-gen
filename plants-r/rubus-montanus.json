    "intro": "Rubus montanus, commonly known as the mountain raspberry, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of North America. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant produces edible berries that are typically red or yellow when ripe, though they are often tart and less commonly consumed than other raspberry varieties. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in forested or rocky habitats. Rubus montanus plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing food for wildlife and supporting pollinator populations."
