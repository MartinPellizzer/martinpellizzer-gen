    "intro": "Rosa canina var. mentacea, commonly known as the Mentaceae rose, is a variant of the dog rose, characterized by its distinct floral morphology. It typically features pale pink to white flowers with five petals and numerous stamens, which contribute to its ornamental appeal. The plant produces aggregate fruits known as hips, which are rich in vitamin C and used in traditional medicine. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with serrated margins, and the stems are thorny. This variety is often found in woodland edges and open habitats across Europe."
