    "intro": "Ridsdalea anisophylloides, commonly known as the broad-leafed ridsdalea, is a rare and striking member of the Araliaceae family. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often variegated with white and green patterns. Native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia, this plant thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its unique foliage makes it a sought-after specimen in botanical gardens and private collections. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
