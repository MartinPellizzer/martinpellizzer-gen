It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. The leaves are typically arranged in odd pinnate patterns and are covered with a fine, grayish pubescence. This subspecies is adapted to high-altitude environments, often growing in rocky or alpine conditions. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and relatively rare member of the Rosa genus."
