It produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically harvested in late summer. The plant has compound leaves with serrated edges and produces white to pale pink flowers in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in dry, rocky areas. Its berries are edible but have a tart flavor, making them suitable for jams and pies."
