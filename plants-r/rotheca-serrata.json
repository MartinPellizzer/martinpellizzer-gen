    "intro": "Rotheca serrata, commonly known as the serrated rotheca, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia, including India and China. It belongs to the family Scrophulariaceae and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Rotheca serrata is used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits, though scientific validation of these uses is limited."
