    "intro": "Ricinocarpos villosus var. grandifolius, commonly known as the large-leaved sand mat, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and hairy, gray-green foliage. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are broad and ovate, often with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. This species is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in sandy or gravelly soils."
