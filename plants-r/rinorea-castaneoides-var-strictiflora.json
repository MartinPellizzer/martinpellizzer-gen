It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and clusters of small, pale yellow flowers. It typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release its seeds, contributing to its dispersal in the wild."
