    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus subsp. crassus, commonly known as the broad-leaved buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features palmately divided, bright green leaves with a waxy coating, and produces showy yellow flowers with numerous stamens. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. It is characterized by its robust, thick stems and is known for its early spring bloom. The subspecies crassus is distinguished by its larger, more robust leaves compared to the typical form of R. auricomus."
