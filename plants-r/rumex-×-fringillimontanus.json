    "intro": "Rumex \u00d7 fringillimontanus, commonly known as the hybrid sorrel, is a naturally occurring hybrid between Rumex acetosa (common sorrel) and Rumex acetobulus (greater sorrel). It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves and reddish veins. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in moist, fertile soils and is often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits a range of morphological variations depending on its geographic location and environmental conditions."
