    "intro": "Ranunculus ficaria subf. incumbens, commonly known as the creeping buttercup, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically features a mat-forming growth habit with stems that spread along the ground, often rooting at the nodes. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom in early spring. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a hairy surface that helps reduce water loss. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks."
