    "intro": "Rapanea robusta var. sessiliflora, commonly known as the sessile-flowered rapanea, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Lauraceae, which includes laurels, and is characterized by its aromatic, glossy, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that are typically sessile, meaning they lack stalks, giving it its specific epithet. The fruit is a small, dark blue drupe, containing a single seed. It is often found in lowland and hill forest environments, thriving in humid, shaded conditions."
