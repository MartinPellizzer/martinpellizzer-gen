    "intro": "Rubus tereticaulis var. hypoglaucus, commonly known as the smooth-stemmed blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to parts of North America. It is characterized by its slender, often thornless stems and small, dark purple to black berries. The leaves are typically trifoliate, with three oval-shaped leaflets that have a slightly serrated edge. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its botanical features make it distinct from other Rubus species, particularly in its smooth stem texture and fruit characteristics."
