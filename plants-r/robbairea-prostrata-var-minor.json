    "intro": "Robbairea prostrata var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf prostrate robbairea, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to South America. It features small, ovate leaves that are typically covered in a fine pubescence, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its compact size and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and container gardening."
