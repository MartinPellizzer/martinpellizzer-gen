    "intro": "Ranunculus trichophyllus var. heterophyllus, commonly known as the variable water crowfoot, is a herbaceous perennial native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist or wet habitats such as marshes, stream banks, and pond edges. The plant features trifoliate leaves with a distinctive lobed structure and produces small, yellow flowers with five petals. Its stems are often hairy, and the leaves are usually submerged or floating, adapting to aquatic environments. This variant is notable for its morphological variability, which can lead to confusion with other ranunculus species."
