It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia, particularly China. The plant features broad, leathery leaves and produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. Its ornamental value lies in its elegant white petals and compact growth habit, making it a desirable addition to gardens. This form is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in acidic, well-drained soils."
