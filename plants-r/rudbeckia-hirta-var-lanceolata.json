    "intro": "Rudbeckia hirta var. lanceolata, commonly known as the lanceleaf coneflower, is a perennial herb native to the eastern and central United States. It features upright, branching stems that can grow up to 2 to 3 feet tall, covered in coarse, hairy foliage. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flower heads with a distinctive brown central disk, typical of the Asteraceae family. Its lance-shaped leaves are narrow and pointed, giving it its varietal name. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
