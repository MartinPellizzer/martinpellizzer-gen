    "intro": "Ranunculus subcorymbosus var. mirissimus, commonly known as the showy buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a basal rosette of dark green, velvety leaves with finely toothed margins. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with numerous petals arranged in a cup-like structure, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in some environments."
