It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers and sticky seed pods. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland regions. It has small, compound leaves and produces small, pea-like flowers that attract nectar-feeding insects. The sticky seeds are adapted for dispersal by attaching to the fur of animals or clothing."
