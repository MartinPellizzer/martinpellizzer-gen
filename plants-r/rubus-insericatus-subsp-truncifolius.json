It is characterized by its thorny stems and trifoliate leaves with a distinctive truncate (cut-off) shape at the base. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or yellow in color. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forested areas or along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for horticultural and ecological studies."
