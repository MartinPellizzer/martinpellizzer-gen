It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss. The plants typically have small, inconspicuous flowers, often clustered in inflorescences. Ruspolia species are often grown as ornamental plants due to their unique foliage. They thrive in well-drained soil and require moderate to bright light for optimal growth."
