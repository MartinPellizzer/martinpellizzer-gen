    "intro": "Rosa bovernieriana, commonly known as the Bournier's rose, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring thorny stems and compound leaves. The plant produces fragrant, pink to red flowers in the spring, which are followed by oval, red-orange fruits called hips. Rosa bovernieriana is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, often found in forested or open slopes. Its ornamental value makes it a sought-after plant in horticulture, though it is relatively rare in cultivation."
