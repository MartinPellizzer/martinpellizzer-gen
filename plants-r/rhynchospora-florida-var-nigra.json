    "intro": "Rhynchospora florida var. nigra, commonly known as black-flowered marsh sedge, is a perennial herb native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dark purple to black bracts that contrast with its grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in swamps, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are clustered at the ends of the stems. This variety is notable for its striking coloration and ecological importance in supporting wetland biodiversity."
