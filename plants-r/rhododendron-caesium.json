    "intro": "Rhododendron caesium, commonly known as the purple-leaved rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its striking dark purple to almost black foliage, which contrasts beautifully with its showy, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows as an evergreen shrub, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for shaded garden settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its unique leaf color and clusters of fragrant blooms that appear in early spring."
