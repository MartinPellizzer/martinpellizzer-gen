    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 primordialis, commonly known as the blackberry raspberry hybrid, is a deciduous shrub belonging to the Rosaceae family. It is a natural cross between Rubus ursinus (blackberry) and Rubus idaeus (raspberry), resulting in a plant that exhibits traits of both parents. The plant produces aggregate fruits that are typically dark red to black in color, with a tart and sometimes sweet flavor. Its thorny stems and compound leaves are characteristic of the Rubus genus. This hybrid is often cultivated for its edible fruits and ornamental value in gardens."
