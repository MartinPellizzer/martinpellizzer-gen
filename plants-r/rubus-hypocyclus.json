    "intro": "Rubus hypocyclus, commonly known as the smooth bramble, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its thornless stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, white to pink flowers in the spring, which are followed by edible, red berries in the fall. Its berries are often used in jams and pies, and the plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits. Rubus hypocyclus thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and thickets."
