    "intro": "Rhodiola henryi, commonly known as the Chinese rhodiola, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the family Crassulaceae and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments and possesses a deep root system that helps it survive in harsh conditions. It is also noted for its ability to thrive in poor soil and withstand extreme temperatures. Rhodiola henryi is often used in traditional Chinese medicine for its purported adaptogenic properties."
