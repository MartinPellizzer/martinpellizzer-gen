    "intro": "Robinia decaisneana, commonly known as the Decaisne's Robinia, is a rare and striking member of the Fabaceae family. It is native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America, particularly in Chile and Argentina. The plant is characterized by its large, palmate leaves and showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. It is a shrub or small tree, typically reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
