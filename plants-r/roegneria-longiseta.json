    "intro": "Roegneria longiseta, commonly known as the long-bracted wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and elongated, narrow leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces dense clusters of spikelets, each bearing small, bracted florets that give it its distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Roegneria longiseta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant landscaping."
