    "intro": "Ranunculus repens var. brevistylus, commonly known as the short-styled buttercup, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, riverbanks, and wetlands. Due to its delicate structure and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
