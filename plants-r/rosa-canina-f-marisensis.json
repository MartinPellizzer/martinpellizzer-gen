It is characterized by its distinctive pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in coastal areas, where it thrives in salty, well-drained soils. Its leaves are pinnate with serrated edges, and the fruits, known as hips, are orange-red and contain a high concentration of vitamin C. This subspecies is notable for its hardiness and adaptability to maritime climates."
