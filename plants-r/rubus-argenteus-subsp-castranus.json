It is characterized by its silvery-white undersides on its leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, dark berries that are typically edible but not widely cultivated. It thrives in moist, wooded areas and is often found in the eastern United States. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological studies and local biodiversity."
