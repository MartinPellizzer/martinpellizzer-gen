    "intro": "Rosa grossularifolia, commonly known as the alpine rose, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows in alpine and subalpine environments, often in rocky or gravelly soils. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, pink to white flowers in the summer, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits. Its leaves are dark green, simple, and have a slightly serrated edge. Rosa grossularifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and beauty."
