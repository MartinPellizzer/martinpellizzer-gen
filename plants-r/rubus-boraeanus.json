It belongs to the Rubus genus, which includes many species of shrubs commonly referred to as blackberries or raspberries. The plant is characterized by its prickly stems, compound leaves, and small, aggregate fruits. It typically grows in forested areas and along stream banks, preferring moist, temperate climates.
