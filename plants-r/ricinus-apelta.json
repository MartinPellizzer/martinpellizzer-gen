    "intro": "Ricinus apelta, commonly known as the African castor or red castor, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves and showy, red bracts that enclose its small yellow flowers. The plant produces a toxic, oil-rich seed capsule, which contains ricin, one of the most poisonous substances known. It thrives in warm, sunny environments and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine."
