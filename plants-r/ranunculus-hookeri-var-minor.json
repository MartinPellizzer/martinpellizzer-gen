    "intro": "Ranunculus hookeri var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf buttercup, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of South America. It features delicate, palmately divided leaves and bright yellow, cup-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically reaches a height of less than 10 centimeters, making it a compact and ornamental species. It thrives in cool, moist environments and prefers well-drained, loamy soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
