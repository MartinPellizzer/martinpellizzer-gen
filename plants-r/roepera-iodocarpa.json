    "intro": "Roepera iodocarpa, commonly known as the iodocarpic roepera, is a rare and lesser-known plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, clustered leaves and produces unique, aromatic fruits that contain a high concentration of iodine compounds. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical rainforests. Its botanical features include a woody stem and small, ovate leaves with a smooth surface. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
