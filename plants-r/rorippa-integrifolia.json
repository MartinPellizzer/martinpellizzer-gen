    "intro": "Rorippa integrifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf watercress, is a flowering plant in the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, heart-shaped leaves and small white or pink flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant is typically found in moist or aquatic environments, such as ponds, ditches, and stream banks. It has a smooth, succulent stem and is often used in traditional herbal medicine. Its seeds are dispersed by water, allowing it to colonize new areas effectively."
