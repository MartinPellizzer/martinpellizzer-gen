    "intro": "Ranunculus carnosus, commonly known as the woolly buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It features basal leaves that are typically hairy and lobed, with a distinctive woolly texture. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with five petals, often accompanied by a central yellow ovary. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in some regions."
