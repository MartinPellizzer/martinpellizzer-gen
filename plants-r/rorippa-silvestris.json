    "intro": "Rorippa silvestris, commonly known as wild watercress, is a flowering plant in the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its alternate, pinnately compound leaves that are often submerged or floating in aquatic environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are typically arranged in racemes, and it is often found in wetlands, ditches, and along the edges of ponds. Rorippa silvestris is a perennial herb that can grow up to 30 cm in height, with a fibrous root system adapted to waterlogged soils. Its seeds are dispersed by water, allowing it to spread easily in moist habitats."
