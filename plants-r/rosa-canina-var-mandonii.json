    "intro": "Rosa canina var. mandonii, commonly known as the Mandonii rose, is a less commonly cultivated variant of the dog rose. It is characterized by its pink to red flowers and thorny stems, typical of the Rosa canina species. The plant is native to the Balkan Peninsula and parts of southern Europe, thriving in temperate climates. It produces small, red-orange hips that are rich in vitamin C. Due to its ornamental value and historical use in herbal medicine, it is occasionally grown in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts."
