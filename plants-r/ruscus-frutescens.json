    "intro": "Ruscus frutescens, commonly known as butcher's broom, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to Europe and parts of North Africa. It features dense clusters of small, waxy, spiny leaves that form a compact, cushion-like structure. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring, followed by red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value. Botanically, it belongs to the family Asparagaceae and is closely related to the genus Ruscus, which includes other similar species."
