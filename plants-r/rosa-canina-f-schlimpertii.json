    "intro": "Rosa canina f. schlimpertii, commonly known as the Schlimper's dog rose, is a botanical variant of the dog rose, characterized by its distinctive floral morphology. This form exhibits a more compact growth habit compared to the typical Rosa canina, with smaller, more densely packed flowers. The foliage is usually dark green and slightly serrated, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It is native to Central and Eastern Europe, where it thrives in temperate climates. The plant is valued for its hardiness and ability to produce fragrant, pink to red blooms in late spring."
