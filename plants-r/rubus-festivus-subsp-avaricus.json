    "intro": "Rubus festivus subsp. avaricus, commonly known as the showy blackberry, is a species of bramble native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, dark red berries that are typically edible, though they are often described as tart and less palatable compared to other blackberry varieties. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils. The subspecies is notable for its ornamental value and its role in supporting local wildlife."
