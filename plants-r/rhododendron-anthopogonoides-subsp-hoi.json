    "intro": "Rhododendron anthopogonoides subsp. hoi, commonly known as the Hainan rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of southern China, particularly Hainan Island. It is a shrub characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in primary forests at elevations between 500 and 1,500 meters. Its leaves are typically elliptical, leathery, and have a glossy surface, while its flowers are often fragrant and bloom in late spring to early summer. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited geographic distribution."
