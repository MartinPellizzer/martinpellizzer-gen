It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, aggregate fruits. The plant produces red, edible berries that are similar in appearance to those of other Rubus species. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland or shrubland habitats. Due to its ornamental and culinary potential, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
