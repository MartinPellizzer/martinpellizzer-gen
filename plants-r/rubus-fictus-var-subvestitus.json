    "intro": "Rubus fictus var. subvestitus, commonly known as the hairy raspberry. This variant is characterized by its dense, pubescent foliage and stems, which give it a distinctive fuzzy appearance. It produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red when ripe, similar to other Rubus species. The plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides. Its botanical features make it a notable species within the Rubus genus, though it is less commonly cultivated than other raspberries."
