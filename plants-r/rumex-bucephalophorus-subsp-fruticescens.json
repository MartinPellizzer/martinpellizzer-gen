    "intro": "Rumex bucephalophorus subsp. fruticescens, commonly known as the creeping dock, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils such as along roadsides, in meadows, and near water bodies. The plant features upright stems that often lie prostrate, with broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are small and clustered in loose inflorescences, and it produces elongated, ribbed fruits. This subspecies is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
