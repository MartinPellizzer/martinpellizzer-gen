    "intro": "Robinia pauciflora, commonly known as the sourwood tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged with oval, serrated leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring. Its fruit is a legume pod that splits open to release seeds with tufts of hair for wind dispersal. The tree is valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types."
