    "intro": "Rosa tomentella var. caryophyllacea, commonly known as the woolly rose or the red-stemmed rose, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly gray foliage and stems, which provide insulation against cold temperatures. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink to red, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in cooler climates."
