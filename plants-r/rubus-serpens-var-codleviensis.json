    "intro": "Rubus serpens var. codleviensis, commonly known as the Codlevi's blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and thorny stems, which help it to climb and spread across forest floors. The plant produces small, dark purple berries that are typically harvested when fully ripe. Botanically, it belongs to the Rosaceae family and is closely related to other Rubus species. Its leaves are typically trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments."
