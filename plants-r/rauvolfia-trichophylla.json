    "intro": "Rauvolfia trichophylla, commonly known as the Indian snakeroot, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its climbing habit, with opposite, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered white or pink flowers, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Rauvolfia trichophylla is notable for its medicinal properties, particularly due to the presence of alkaloids like reserpine."
