    "intro": "Rhus thunbergiana, commonly known as the Chinese sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 5\u201311 pairs of serrated leaflets arranged opposite each other. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in panicles, followed by red-orange, fuzzy fruits that are edible for birds and some mammals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or rocky areas. Rhus thunbergiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate urban environments."
