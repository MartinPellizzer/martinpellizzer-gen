It is characterized by its large, lobed leaves and thorny stems, typical of the Rubus genus. The plant produces aggregate fruits, which are dark purple to black when mature, and are often used in local cuisines. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and small-scale agriculture."
