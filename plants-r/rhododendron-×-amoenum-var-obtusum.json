It features dense, evergreen foliage with broad, leathery leaves that are typically dark green. The plant produces showy, clustered flowers in shades of pink to red, often blooming in early spring. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens.
