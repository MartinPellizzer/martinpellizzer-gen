    "intro": "Rhododendron sidereum, commonly known as the purple-leaved rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its striking purple foliage and clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in acidic, well-drained soils and thrives in partial to full shade. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes. However, it is important to note that it can be invasive in certain regions if not properly managed."
