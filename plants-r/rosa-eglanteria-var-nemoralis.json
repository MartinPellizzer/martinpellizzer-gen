    "intro": "Rosa eglanteria var. nemoralis, commonly known as the prickly rose or brambles, is a shrub-like plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, white or pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets, and the plant produces small, red berries that are edible but have a tart flavor. It thrives in woodland edges, hedgerows, and disturbed soils, and is often found in moist, shaded environments. This species is known for its hardy nature and ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative growth."
