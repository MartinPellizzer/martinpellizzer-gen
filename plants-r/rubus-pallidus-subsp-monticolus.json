    "intro": "Rubus pallidus subsp. monticolus, commonly known as the alpine raspberry, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender stems, trifoliate leaves, and small, aggregate fruits that ripen to a red or black color. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. It produces white to pale yellow flowers in the spring, and its growth is adapted to withstand cold temperatures and high altitudes. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological adaptations and limited distribution."
