    "intro": "Rubus ulmifolius var. congeneratus, commonly known as the creeping blackberry, is a species of bramble native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and dark green, trifoliate leaves that resemble those of the elm tree. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by edible blackberries in late summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
