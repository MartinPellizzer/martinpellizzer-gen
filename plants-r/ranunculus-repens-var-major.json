    "intro": "Ranunculus repens var. major, commonly known as the creeping buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features bright yellow flowers with five to eight petals, typically appearing in early spring. The plant has a sprawling growth habit, with rhizomes that allow it to spread across moist, often disturbed soils. Its leaves are trifoliate, with lobed segments, and it is often found in wet meadows, streambanks, and coastal areas. The species is known for its rapid colonization of open habitats, sometimes becoming invasive in certain environments."
