    "intro": "Rhododendron liboense, commonly known as the Liangshan rhododendron, is a flowering shrub native to the mountainous regions of Sichuan and Yunnan in southwestern China. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves and clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to deep red. The plant thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers cool, moist climates with high humidity. It is often found in cloud forests at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
