    "intro": "Ribes peruvianum var. maius, commonly known as the Peruvian gooseberry, is a deciduous shrub native to South America. It belongs to the Grossulariaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant red or orange berries that ripen in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, temperate climates and thrives in partial to full sunlight. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have serrated edges, while its stems are covered in fine hairs. The berries are not only ornamental but also edible, though they are often used in jams and preserves due to their tart flavor."
