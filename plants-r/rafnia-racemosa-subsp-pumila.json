    "intro": "Rafnia racemosa subsp. pumila, commonly known as the dwarf sycamore, is a small, deciduous tree native to parts of Southeast Asia. It typically grows to a height of 5-10 meters and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in racemes during the spring, followed by spherical, woody fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
