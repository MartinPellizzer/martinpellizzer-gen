    "intro": "Ranunculus macrophyllus, commonly known as the broadleaf buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features showy, cup-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange with dark centers, and its leaves are large, lobed, and often covered in fine hairs. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. It has a short stem with alternate leaves and produces small, hairy fruits that disperse its seeds. Ranunculus macrophyllus is valued for its ornamental appeal but can be invasive in some regions."
