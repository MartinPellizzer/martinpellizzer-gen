It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black in color. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous areas. Due to its hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable climates."
