    "intro": "Rapanea lanceolata var. ouenarouensis, commonly known as the Ouenarouensis boxwood, is a rare evergreen shrub native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by red, fleshy berries. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in montane rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
