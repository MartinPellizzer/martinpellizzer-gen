    "intro": "Rubus cupanianus subsp. nebrodensis, commonly known as the Nebroden raspberry, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or orange in color, often used in local culinary traditions. The plant has pinnately compound leaves with serrated edges and produces white or pink flowers in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to temperate climates. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its range."
