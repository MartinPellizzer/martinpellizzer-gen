    "intro": "Romulea linaresii var. gaditana, commonly known as the Iberian romulea, is a bulbous perennial plant native to southern Spain. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its grass-like leaves and delicate, yellowish-white flowers. The plant produces small, rounded bulbs that store nutrients for the next growing season. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or limestone-rich habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and protected species in its native region."
