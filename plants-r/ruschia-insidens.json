It features fleshy, cylindrical leaves that are typically green or reddish in color, often with a waxy coating. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of red, pink, or white, which bloom in spring and summer. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it well-suited for rock gardens or arid landscapes. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
