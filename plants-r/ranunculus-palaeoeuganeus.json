    "intro": "Ranunculus palaeoeuganeus, commonly known as the ancient Euganean buttercup, is a rare and ancient species of flowering plant native to the Friuli-Venezia Giulia region of Italy. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family, characterized by its showy, often brightly colored flowers and simple, palmately lobed leaves. This plant is notable for its historical significance, as it was once widespread but is now restricted to a few isolated populations. Its small, yellow flowers typically bloom in early spring, and it prefers moist, calcareous soils in woodland or meadow habitats. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Ranunculus palaeoeuganeus is considered a critically endangered species."
