    "intro": "Rhododendron extraneum, commonly known as the Yunnan rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan Province in China. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows at high altitudes, often in forested areas with cool, moist climates. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to white, often appearing in clusters. Its leaves are broad and leathery, providing a dense canopy that helps retain moisture in its native habitat. Rhododendron extraneum is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological diversity of its mountainous environment."
