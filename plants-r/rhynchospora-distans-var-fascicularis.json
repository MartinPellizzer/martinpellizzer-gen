    "intro": "Rhynchospora distans var. fascicularis, commonly known as the clustered spike-rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy habitats in North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and dense, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikes, often surrounded by bracts. This variety is distinguished by its fasciculate (clustered) growth pattern, which sets it apart from other forms of Rhynchospora distans."
