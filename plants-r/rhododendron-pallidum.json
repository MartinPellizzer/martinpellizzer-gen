It features lance-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color, with a fuzzy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, blooming in late spring. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in gardens and natural landscapes."
