    "intro": "Rhomboda alticola, commonly known as the highland rhomboda, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow to white flowers that bloom in the summer months. Rhomboda alticola thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or mountainous terrain. Due to its limited habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
