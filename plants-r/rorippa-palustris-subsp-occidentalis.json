    "intro": "Rorippa palustris subsp. occidentalis, commonly known as western water pennycress, is a small annual herbaceous plant native to North America. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and streams, where it thrives in moist to aquatic conditions. The plant has alternate, trifoliate leaves that are often submerged or floating, and it produces small, yellow flowers in early spring. It is characterized by its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed wetland areas. The seeds are enclosed in a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds."
