    "intro": "Rhinanthus major subsp. aestivalis, commonly known as the common yellow rattle, is a flowering plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It is an annual herb that grows up to 60 cm tall, characterized by its yellow-orange flowers that bloom from June to August. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. It is often found in grasslands, meadows, and along roadsides, where it plays a role in promoting biodiversity by reducing dominant grass species. Its nectar-rich flowers attract a variety of pollinators, including bees and butterflies."
