The plant produces rose hips, which are rich in vitamin C and used in traditional herbal remedies. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and covered in fine hairs, while its root system is fibrous and adapted to well-drained soils. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in perfumery and medicine."
