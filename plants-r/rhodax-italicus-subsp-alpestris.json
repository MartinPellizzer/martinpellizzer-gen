    "intro": "Rhodax italicus subsp. alpestris, commonly known as the alpine rhodax, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically thrives in well-drained, rocky soils at high altitudes. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of silvery hair, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in alpine gardens."
