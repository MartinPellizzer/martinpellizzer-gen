    "intro": "Rumex \u00d7 melinkae, commonly known as the hybrid sorrel, is a naturally occurring hybrid between Rumex acetosa (common sorrel) and Rumex acetobulus (broadleaf sorrel). It is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are typically reddish or purple-tinged on the underside. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are borne on erect, branching stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland edges and wet meadows. Its botanical features make it distinguishable from its parent species, though it can be challenging to identify without close examination."
