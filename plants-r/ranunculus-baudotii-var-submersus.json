    "intro": "Ranunculus baudotii var. submersus, commonly known as the submerged water crowfoot, is a rare aquatic plant native to specific regions of Europe. It is characterized by its finely divided, ribbon-like leaves that float on the water surface, with roots anchoring it to the substrate. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers with five petals, typically emerging from the water during the summer months. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many areas."
