    "intro": "Ranunculus aesontinus, commonly known as the Alpine buttercup, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its bright yellow, cup-shaped flowers and trifoliate leaves, which are typically covered in a fine layer of hairs. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family, which includes many other showy and sometimes toxic plants. Ranunculus aesontinus is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in pollination by attracting insects such as bees and butterflies."
