The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun, making it well-suited for dry, coastal environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, contributing to its overall compact and shrub-like appearance. The species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
