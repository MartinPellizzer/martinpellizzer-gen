    "intro": "Restrepia chrysoglossa, commonly known as the golden-tongue orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Andean regions of South America. It features a pseudobulb with a single, lance-shaped leaf and produces pendulous inflorescences with showy, yellowish-green flowers. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments with well-drained soil, often growing in shaded forest understories. Its flowers have a distinctive, elongated lip that is broader than the rest of the petals, contributing to its unique appearance. Restrepia chrysoglossa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and relatively easy care requirements."
