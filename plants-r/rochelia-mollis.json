    "intro": "Rochelia mollis, commonly known as the slender sea fennel, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its aromatic, finely divided leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in saline environments. Its growth is typically low and sprawling, with a mat-like structure that helps it withstand harsh coastal conditions. Rochelia mollis plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for small coastal organisms."
