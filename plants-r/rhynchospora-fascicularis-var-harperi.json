    "intro": "Rhynchospora fascicularis var. harperi, commonly known as the narrowleaf spike-rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas of North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, characterized by its grass-like appearance and rhizomatous growth habit. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that are typically reddish-brown in color, with small, scale-like flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a distinct midrib, and it thrives in saturated or seasonally flooded soils. This variant is distinguished by its narrower leaves compared to the typical form of R. fascicularis."
