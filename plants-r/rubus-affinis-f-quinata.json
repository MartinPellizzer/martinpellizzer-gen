It features five leaflets, which is a key botanical trait distinguishing it from the typical three-leaflet form of Rubus affinis. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red when ripe, though they may vary in color depending on the cultivar. It is a deciduous shrub that thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and edible fruits. Botanically, it belongs to the Rosaceae family and is native to regions of East Asia."
