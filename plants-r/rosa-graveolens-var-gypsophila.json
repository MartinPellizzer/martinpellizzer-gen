    "intro": "Rosa graveolens var. gypsophila, commonly known as the sweet briar rose, is a shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces rose hips, which are the fruit containing the seeds. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often found in hedgerows and woodland edges. Its ornamental value and historical use in hedging and perfume-making make it a notable botanical species."
