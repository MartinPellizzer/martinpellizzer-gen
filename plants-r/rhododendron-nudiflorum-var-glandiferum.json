It is characterized by its upright growth habit and lance-shaped, dark green leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring. Its flowers are distinctive for their glandular structures, which give the variety its name. The plant prefers well-drained, acidic soils and partial to full sunlight."
