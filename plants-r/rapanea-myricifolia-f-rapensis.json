The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by bright red, fleshy berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
