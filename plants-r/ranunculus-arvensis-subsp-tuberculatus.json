    "intro": "Ranunculus arvensis subsp. tuberculatus, commonly known as the hairy buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers with five petals and a hairy stem that distinguishes it from other ranunculus species. The leaves are typically trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the plant often grows in moist, disturbed soils such as meadows and roadsides. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. This subspecies is notable for its adaptability and is often found in a variety of habitats across its range."
