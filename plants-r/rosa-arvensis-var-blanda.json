    "intro": "Rosa arvensis var. blanda, commonly known as the creeping dog rose, is a low-growing shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, trailing stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink to white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with five to seven leaflets that are serrated along the edges. This variety is often found in disturbed soils and is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread."
