    "intro": "Rubus thyrsoideus proles phyllostachys, commonly known as the Chinese evergreen raspberry, is a unique hybrid plant that combines traits from both Rubus and Phyllostachys genera. It is characterized by its dense, thorny growth habit and the presence of both bramble-like stems and bamboo-like culms. The plant produces clusters of small, edible berries that are often used in traditional Chinese medicine. Its leaves are typically broad and lance-shaped, with a glossy surface and a serrated edge. This hybrid is well-suited for ornamental purposes and can thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
