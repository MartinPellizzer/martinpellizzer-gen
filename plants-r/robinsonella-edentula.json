    "intro": "Robinsonella edentula, commonly known as the smoothleaf sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it has finely divided, grass-like leaves. It is adapted to harsh environments, with deep roots that help it survive in dry conditions. Robinsonella edentula is often found in sandy soils and is considered a low-growing, drought-tolerant species."
