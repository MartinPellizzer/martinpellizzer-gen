    "intro": "Racosperma froggattii, commonly known as the Grey Box, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its greyish-barked trunk and dense foliage. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish coating, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It produces yellow flowers in spikes, followed by woody pods that contain edible seeds. Racosperma froggattii is adapted to low rainfall and is often found in open woodlands and on rocky soils."
