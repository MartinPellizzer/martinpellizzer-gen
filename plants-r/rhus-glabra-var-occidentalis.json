    "intro": "Rhus glabra var. occidentalis, commonly known as smooth sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern and central United States. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and compound leaves that turn vibrant red in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by red, fuzzy berries that are a food source for birds and wildlife. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established. Smooth sumac is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
