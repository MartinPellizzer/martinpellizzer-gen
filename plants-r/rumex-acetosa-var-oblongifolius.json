    "intro": "Rumex acetosa var. oblongifolius, commonly known as broad-leaved sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features upright, branching stems that bear alternate, heart-shaped to ovate leaves with a wavy margin. The leaves are typically covered in a fine layer of hairs and have a sour taste due to the presence of oxalic acid. It produces small, greenish flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. This plant thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in woodland edges."
