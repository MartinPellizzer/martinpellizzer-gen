    "intro": "Rosa glauca f. caballicensis, commonly known as the Caballic Mountain rose, is a rare and distinctive cultivar of the Rosa glauca species. It is characterized by its pale blue to lavender-colored flowers and its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant typically features thorny stems and dark green, leathery leaves that are somewhat hairy to the touch. It is native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus, where it thrives in well-drained, alkaline soils. Due to its limited distribution and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by horticultural enthusiasts."
