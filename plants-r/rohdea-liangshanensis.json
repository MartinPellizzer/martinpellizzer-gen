    "intro": "Rohdea liangshanensis, commonly known as the Liangshan rohdea, is a rare and lesser-known member of the Zingiberaceae family. Native to the mountainous regions of Sichuan, China, it thrives in humid, shaded environments with well-drained soil. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often striped with contrasting colors, adding to its ornamental value. Its flowering stems produce small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers, which are typically short-lived. Due to its restricted habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
