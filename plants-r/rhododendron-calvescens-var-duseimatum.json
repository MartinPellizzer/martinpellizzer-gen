    "intro": "Rhododendron calvescens var. duseimatum, commonly known as the Duseimatum rhododendron, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It features dense clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to deep red, blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has dark green, leathery foliage that provides an attractive evergreen structure throughout the year. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to form thick, bushy growth that can be shaped for aesthetic appeal."
