    "intro": "Rhododendron deflexum, commonly known as the bent-leaved rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of showy, tubular flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in acidic, well-drained soils and thrives in shaded to partially shaded environments. Its leaves are leathery and often curl downward, giving it its common name. Rhododendron deflexum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in cooler climates."
