    "intro": "Romulea campanuloides var. gigantea, commonly known as the giant bell-shaped romulea, is a striking bulbous perennial plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters, adorned with showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange. The plant produces clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a basal rosette, providing a striking contrast to its vibrant blooms. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. The flowers are typically short-lived but add dramatic visual impact to the garden during the flowering season."
