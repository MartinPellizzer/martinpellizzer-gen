    "intro": "Rosa alpina var. subconnivens, commonly known as the Alpine rose, is a compact shrub native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features dense, dark green foliage and produces showy, pink to red flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant is characterized by its tightly clustered, semi-double blooms that are often fragrant. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy ornamental plant suitable for rock gardens. Its botanical significance lies in its adaptation to high-altitude environments and its role in alpine ecosystems."
