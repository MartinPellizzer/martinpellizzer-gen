    "intro": "Rubus candicans var. acutiserratus, commonly known as the sharp-toothed raspberry, is a species of bramble native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and prickly stems, which are covered in fine, glandular hairs. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red when ripe, though they may vary in color depending on the variety. Its leaves are palmately compound, with serrated margins that are notably sharp, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in moist, woodland habitats and is often found in shaded areas with rich, organic soil."
