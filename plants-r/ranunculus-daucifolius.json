    "intro": "Ranunculus daucifolius, commonly known as the meadow buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its bright yellow, saucer-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a distinctive, almost fern-like appearance, and it produces small, hairy fruits that disperse its seeds by wind. Ranunculus daucifolius is often found in disturbed habitats and is considered a valuable plant for pollinators."
