    "intro": "Ranunculus ruscinonensis, commonly known as the Ruscinonese buttercup, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the Carpathian Mountains. It is characterized by its bright yellow, cup-shaped flowers and trifoliate leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It has small, hairy stems and produces numerous seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
