    "intro": "Rosa \u00d7 muscipula, commonly known as the sticky rose or the sticky shrub rose, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Rosa rugosa and Rosa multiflora. It is characterized by its dense, thorny growth habit and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types, making it a hardy species. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with serrated edges, and the stems are covered in stiff, sticky hairs. Rosa \u00d7 muscipula is often used as a hedge or barrier due to its vigorous growth and dense foliage."
