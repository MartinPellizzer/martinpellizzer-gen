    "intro": "Ranunculus shanyangensis, commonly known as the Shanyang buttercup, is a rare flowering plant native to China. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as mountainous regions and forest floors. Its leaves are palmately divided, and it produces small, hairy fruits that disperse its seeds by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
