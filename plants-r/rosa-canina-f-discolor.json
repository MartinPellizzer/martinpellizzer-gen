    "intro": "Rosa canina f. discolor, commonly known as the white dog rose, is a botanical variant of the dog rose. It is characterized by its pale pink to white flowers, which differ from the typical red or pink blooms of the standard Rosa canina. The plant produces small, yellowish-orange hips that are edible and used in traditional remedies. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in hedgerows and woodland edges. Its foliage is dark green and slightly hairy, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
