    "intro": "Rumex scandens, commonly known as climbing sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features upright, often climbing stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, covered with fine hairs. The leaves are alternate, heart-shaped, and have a distinctive sour taste due to the presence of oxalic acid. It produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, which are followed by triangular, beak-like seed capsules. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
