    "intro": "Rubus anas, commonly known as the alpine blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its prickly stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically consumed by birds and other wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
