    "intro": "Rhigiocarya leonensis, commonly known as the Leonese rhigiocarya, is a rare and lesser-known plant species native to specific regions of Spain. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants such as buckwheat and sorrel. The plant is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, clustered leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are typically greenish-yellow and appear in late spring, contributing to its unique ecological niche. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
