    "intro": "Rosa naias, commonly known as the water rose, is a rare aquatic plant found in freshwater habitats. It is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of wax. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or white, which bloom in summer. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the water, and it plays a role in maintaining water quality. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, Rosa naias is considered a vulnerable species."
