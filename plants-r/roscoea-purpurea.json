    "intro": "Roscoea purpurea, commonly known as the purple rhombus, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the Himalayas. It features striking, lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with purple or reddish hues. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with showy, violet to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form clumps over time. Roscoea purpurea is valued in gardens for its ornamental foliage and unique floral display."
