    "intro": "Rhodax italicus subsp. rupifragus, commonly known as the alpine rhodax, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and evergreen foliage, which helps it survive in harsh alpine conditions. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in high-altitude meadows and slopes. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its range."
