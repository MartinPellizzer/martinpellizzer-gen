    "intro": "Rhacoma salinum, commonly known as the saltbush, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss, making it well-adapted to saline and drought conditions. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers. Rhacoma salinum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils and tolerate high salinity."
