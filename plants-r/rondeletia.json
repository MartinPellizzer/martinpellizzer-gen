It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and includes species such as Rondeletia leucophaea and Rondeletia splendens. The plants are characterized by their showy, tubular flowers that are often pink, red, or purple, with a distinctive bell-shaped appearance. They typically grow as shrubs or small trees and are valued for their ornamental beauty in gardens. The leaves are usually opposite, simple, and often glossy, adding to the plant's visual appeal."
