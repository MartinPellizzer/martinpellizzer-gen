    "intro": "Rubus kisfaludyanus, commonly known as the Hungarian blackberry, is a species of bramble native to Hungary and parts of Central Europe. It is characterized by its thorny stems and aggregate fruits that develop from multiple small drupes. The plant typically grows in woodland edges, hedgerows, and disturbed soils, preferring temperate climates. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it produces white to pale pink flowers in the spring. The fruit, which ripens in late summer, is valued for its flavor and is used in culinary and traditional medicinal applications."
