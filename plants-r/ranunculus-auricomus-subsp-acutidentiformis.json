    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus subsp. acutidentiformis, commonly known as the sharp-toothed buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a basal rosette of dark green, sharply toothed leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy yellow flowers with five broadly ovate petals, often with a distinctive white or yellow central blotch. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in some regions."
