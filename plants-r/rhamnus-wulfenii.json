    "intro": "Rhamnus wulfenii, commonly known as the European buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters and has dark green, oval-shaped leaves that turn red in the autumn. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, which are followed by dark blue-black berries. Its bark is thick and fissured, and it is often found in woodland edges and rocky soils. Rhamnus wulfenii is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in traditional medicine."
