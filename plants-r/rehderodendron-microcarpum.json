    "intro": "Rehderodendron microcarpum, commonly known as the small-fruited rehderodendron, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces tiny, capsule-like fruits that contain minute seeds, typical of the genus. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
