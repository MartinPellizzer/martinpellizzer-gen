    "intro": "Rhinanthus alectorolophus subsp. buccalis, commonly known as the yellow-rattle, is a flowering plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially depends on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. It is often found in grasslands and meadows, where it helps to suppress dominant grass species. Its ecological role is significant in maintaining biodiversity in its native habitats."
