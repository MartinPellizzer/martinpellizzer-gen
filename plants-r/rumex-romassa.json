    "intro": "Rumex romassa, commonly known as broadleaf sorrel, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on tall, slender stalks. Rumex romassa thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its leaves are edible, though they contain oxalic acid and should be consumed in moderation."
