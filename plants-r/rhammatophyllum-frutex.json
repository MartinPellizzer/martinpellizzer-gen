    "intro": "Rhammatophyllum frutex, commonly known as the creeping broom, is a low-growing shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, narrow leaves that are typically green and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom in the spring and attract pollinators such as bees. Its woody stems are flexible and often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Rhammatophyllum frutex is well adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal and arid environments."
