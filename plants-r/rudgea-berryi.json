    "intro": "Rudgea berryi, commonly known as the red berry tree, is a shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by bright red berries that are edible for birds and small mammals. Rudgea berryi thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an important component of riparian ecosystems."
