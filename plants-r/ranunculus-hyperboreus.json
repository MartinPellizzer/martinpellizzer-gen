    "intro": "Ranunculus hyperboreus, commonly known as the Arctic buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It typically grows in moist, rocky soils and is often found in tundra and alpine environments. The plant features showy, bright yellow flowers with five to eight petal-like sepals, which are actually modified leaves. Its leaves are palmately lobed and covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. Ranunculus hyperboreus is adapted to cold climates and has a short growing season, blooming in late spring to early summer."
