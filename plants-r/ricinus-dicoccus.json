    "intro": "Ricinus dicoccus, commonly known as the two-seed kapok tree, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves and produces long, pendulous clusters of yellow flowers. The plant is notable for its fibrous seed pods, which contain seeds surrounded by a cotton-like substance. The seeds are often used in traditional medicine, while the fibers are used for making textiles. However, the plant is not as widely cultivated as other ricin-producing species due to its specific environmental requirements."
