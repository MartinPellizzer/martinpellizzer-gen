    "intro": "Rubus corylifolius var. hoyoqueseranus, commonly known as the Hoyoque seranus raspberry, is a variant of the evergreen bramble native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces red, edible berries similar to those of other Rubus species, though they are less commonly cultivated. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruit, it is occasionally grown in gardens and conservation areas."
