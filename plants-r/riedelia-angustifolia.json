    "intro": "Riedelia angustifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf riedelia, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the cooler months. Riedelia angustifolia is often found in rocky or mountainous habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific environmental requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
