    "intro": "Rosa canina f. minuscula, commonly known as the miniature dog rose, is a compact, thornless shrub that exhibits smaller flowers and reduced growth compared to the typical Rosa canina. It features pink to white flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, red hips that are edible and rich in vitamin C. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in temperate climates."
