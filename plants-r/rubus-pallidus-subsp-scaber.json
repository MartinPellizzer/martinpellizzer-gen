    "intro": "Rubus pallidus subsp. scaber, commonly known as the rough bramble, is a shrub native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers in the spring, followed by red, hairy berries that ripen in late summer. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, sunny locations. Due to its hardy nature, it is often found in hedgerows and woodland edges."
