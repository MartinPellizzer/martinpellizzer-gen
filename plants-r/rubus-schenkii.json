It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black in color. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
