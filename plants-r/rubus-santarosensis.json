    "intro": "Rubus santarosensis, commonly known as the Santa Rosa blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the coastal regions of California. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and produces dark purple to black berries that are typically harvested in late summer. The plant has trifoliate leaves with serrated edges and produces white to pale pink flowers in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal scrub and chaparral habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
