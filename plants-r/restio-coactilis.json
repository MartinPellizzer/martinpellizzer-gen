    "intro": "Restio coactilis, commonly known as the coastal restio, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Restiaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, clustered inflorescences. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the coastline, where it is adapted to salty air and strong winds. Restio coactilis is often found in dune environments and plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes through its extensive root system. Its flowers are usually white or pale blue and are pollinated by wind or insects."
