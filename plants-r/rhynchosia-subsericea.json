    "intro": "Rhynchosia subsericea, commonly known as the slender cowpea, is a climbing legume native to tropical Africa. It features trifoliate leaves with slender, hairy stipules and produces small, yellow flowers that develop into elongated, slender pods. The plant is characterized by its weak, twining stems and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. It is valued for its edible seeds, which are used in traditional cuisines, and for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. Its botanical features make it an important plant in both ecological and agricultural contexts."
