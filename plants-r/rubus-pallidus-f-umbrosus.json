    "intro": "Rubus pallidus f. umbrosus, commonly known as the pale bramble shade form, is a variant of the pale raspberry plant. It is characterized by its lighter-colored foliage and reduced fruit production compared to the typical Rubus pallidus. This form thrives in shaded environments, making it well-suited for woodland or shaded garden settings. The plant has small, hairy leaves and produces small, pale red berries. It is often found in moist, acidic soils and is valued for its ornamental qualities in horticulture."
