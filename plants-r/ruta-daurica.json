    "intro": "Ruta daurica, commonly known as Russian rue, is a perennial herb native to eastern Europe and western Asia. It features aromatic, pinnately compound leaves with serrated edges, and it produces small, yellowish-green flowers in umbels. The plant is characterized by its strong, pungent odor, which is due to the presence of volatile oils. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for rock gardens or borders. Ruta daurica is also valued for its medicinal properties, though it should be used with caution due to its potential toxicity."
