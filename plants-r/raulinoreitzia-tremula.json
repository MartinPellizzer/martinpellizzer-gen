It belongs to the family Restionaceae, which includes many flowering plants found in southern Africa and Australia. The plant is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, clustered inflorescences. Its growth is adapted to harsh, dry conditions, with deep root systems to access water. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
