    "intro": "Rosa glabrifolia var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy-stemmed rose, is a variant of the glabrifolia rose species. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which distinguish it from the smooth-stemmed form of the parent species. The plant produces fragrant, single or semi-double pink to white flowers during the summer months. It is native to the western United States and thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and hardy nature."
