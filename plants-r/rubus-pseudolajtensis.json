    "intro": "Rubus pseudolajtensis, commonly known as the Lajtai's blackberry, is a species of brambles native to Hungary. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically harvested in late summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and open habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and locally significant species in its native region."
