    "intro": "Ricinocarpus tenuifolius, commonly known as the slender-leafed ricin tree, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces woody fruits that contain seeds with high concentrations of toxic proteins, including ricin. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its toxic properties, it is not typically cultivated for agricultural purposes."
