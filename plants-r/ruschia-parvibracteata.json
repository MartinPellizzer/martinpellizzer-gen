    "intro": "Ruschia parvibracteata, commonly known as the small-bracted Ruschia, is a perennial succulent native to South Africa. It features fleshy, cylindrical stems that are often tinged with red or purple, and it produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange. The plant has small, narrow leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white to grayish hairs. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its compact size and striking floral display, it is well-suited for container gardening as well."
