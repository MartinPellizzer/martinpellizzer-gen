    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus subsp. mancus, commonly known as the golden buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its bright yellow, cup-shaped flowers with 5 to 15 petals, which bloom in early spring. The plant has palmate, trifoliate leaves that are typically hairy and have a distinctive, slightly serrated edge. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and streambanks. The subspecies mancus is distinguished by its slightly smaller flowers and more compact growth habit compared to the typical form."
