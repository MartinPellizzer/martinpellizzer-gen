    "intro": "Rhus toxicodendron var. microcarpon, commonly known as the staghorn sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and have a rough, textured surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in panicles, which are followed by red, fuzzy berries that are a food source for birds and small mammals. Its bark is thick and rugged, giving it a distinctive appearance, and it thrives in full sun to partial shade. The species is also known for its allelopathic properties, which can inhibit the growth of nearby plants."
