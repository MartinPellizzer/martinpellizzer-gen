    "intro": "Rhus schmidelioides, commonly known as the sandpaper oak, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its rough, sandpapery texture on its leaves, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in panicles, followed by clusters of red, fuzzy fruits that are edible for birds. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate with finely toothed margins. Rhus schmidelioides is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to coastal and inland dunes."
