    "intro": "Rosa tomentosa var. lanceolata, commonly known as the woolly rose or the hairy rose, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, grayish-white fuzzy foliage and clusters of fragrant pink to red flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces oval, yellow-orange hips that are edible and often used in herbal remedies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for garden borders and rock gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its unique texture and seasonal color changes."
