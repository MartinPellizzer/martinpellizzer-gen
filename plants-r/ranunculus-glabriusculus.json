    "intro": "Ranunculus glabriusculus, commonly known as the smooth meadow buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist meadows and along stream banks, preferring well-drained soils. The plant features bright yellow flowers with five to seven petals, and its leaves are palmately lobed with a smooth, glabrous surface. It is part of the Ranunculaceae family, known for its showy flowers and often toxic sap. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a threatened species in some regions."
