    "intro": "Rhododendron neriiflorum var. euchaites, commonly known as the Euchaites rhododendron, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, blooming in late spring. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy underneath. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soil and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is less common than other rhododendron species."
