    "intro": "Ruta graveolens var. bracteosa, commonly known as the bracted rue, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features aromatic, pinnately compound leaves with a strong, pungent odor due to the presence of volatile oils. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in umbels, which are followed by small, winged fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or dry habitats. Its medicinal properties have been historically valued, though it contains toxic compounds that require careful handling."
