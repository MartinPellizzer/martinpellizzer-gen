    "intro": "Reynoldsia tahitensis, commonly known as the Tahitian reynoldsia, is a flowering plant native to the island of Tahiti in French Polynesia. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, five-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters, with thick, waxy leaves that are often lobed or serrated. Its flowers, which can be pink, white, or red, bloom in clusters and are an important part of its ecological role in the local ecosystem. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Reynoldsia tahitensis is considered a rare and endangered species."
