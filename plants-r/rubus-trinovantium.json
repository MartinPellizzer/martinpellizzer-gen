    "intro": "Rubus trinovantium, commonly known as the New Zealand bramble, is a shrub native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its prickly stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in spring, followed by edible red berries in summer. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers moist, well-drained conditions. Due to its invasive nature, it is often considered a weed in some regions."
