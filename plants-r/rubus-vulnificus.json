    "intro": "Rubus vulnificus, commonly known as the poison ivy raspberry, is a shrub native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its compound leaves with three leaflets, often with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are followed by red, hairy berries. It is known for its toxic properties, as the berries contain urushiol, which can cause skin irritation in humans. Despite its harmful effects, it plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for certain wildlife species."
