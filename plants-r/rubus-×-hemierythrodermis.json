    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 hemierythrodermis, commonly known as the red-berried blackberry. This hybrid plant is a cross between Rubus ursinus and Rubus idaeus, resulting in a unique combination of traits from both parent species. It is characterized by its dark red to black berries, which are typically larger and more flavorful than those of its parents. The plant produces thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges, typical of the Rubus genus. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its edible fruits and ornamental value."
