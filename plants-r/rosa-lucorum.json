    "intro": "Rosa lucorum, commonly known as the white campion, is a species of flowering plant in the rose family. It is native to Europe and parts of western Asia, often found in grassy areas and along roadsides. The plant produces showy, pink to white flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they consist of three leaflets, and the stems are covered in fine, soft hairs. Rosa lucorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
