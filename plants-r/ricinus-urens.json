    "intro": "Ricinus urens, commonly known as the stinging nettle, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, hollow stems and heart-shaped leaves with stinging hairs that cause a painful rash upon contact. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are wind-pollinated. Ricinus urens is a biennial or short-lived perennial, often found in moist, disturbed soils such as roadsides and fields. It has been used historically for its nutritional and medicinal properties."
