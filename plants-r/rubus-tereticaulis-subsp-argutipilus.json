    "intro": "Rubus tereticaulis subsp. argutipilus, commonly known as the prairie raspberry, is a shrub native to North America, particularly found in grassland and open woodland habitats. It typically grows to a height of about 1\u20132 meters, with slender, arching stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits known as drupes, which are usually red or yellow when ripe. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three oval to lance-shaped leaflets, and the plant is characterized by its prickly stems and flowers. It plays an important role in supporting local wildlife, particularly birds and small mammals, by providing both food and shelter."
