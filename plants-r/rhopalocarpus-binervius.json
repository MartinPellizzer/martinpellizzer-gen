    "intro": "Rhopalocarpus binervius, commonly known as the narrow-leafed rhopalocarpus, is a member of the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and nitrogen-fixing abilities. It is a shrub or small tree native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya and Tanzania. The plant features trifoliate leaves with two distinct veins, giving it its binervius name, which refers to the two nerve patterns. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, with a pea-like structure typical of the Fabaceae family. The plant is known for its ability to thrive in poor soils, making it an important species in ecological restoration efforts."
