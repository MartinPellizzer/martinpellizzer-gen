    "intro": "Rubus glandulosus var. infestus, commonly known as the rough blackberry, is a perennial shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its thorny stems, trifoliate leaves, and small, aggregate fruits that ripen to a dark purple or black color. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and thickets. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, and the plant is known for its vigorous growth and ability to form dense thickets. It is also valued for its edible berries, though they are generally less flavorful compared to other blackberry varieties."
