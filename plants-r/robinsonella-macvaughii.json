    "intro": "Robinsonella macvaughii, commonly known as the MacVaugh's sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its small, showy flowers that bloom in shades of purple and white. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It has slender, branching stems and narrow, linear leaves that help reduce water loss. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
