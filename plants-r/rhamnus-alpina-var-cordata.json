    "intro": "Rhamnus alpina var. cordata, commonly known as the Alpine buckthorn, is a shrub native to alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves that are often pubescent on the underside. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by red or black berries that are an important food source for birds and small mammals. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in cooler climates."
