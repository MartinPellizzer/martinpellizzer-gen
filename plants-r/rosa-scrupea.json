It is native to regions of Asia, including China, Korea, and Japan, where it thrives in mountainous and forested areas. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which give it a rough texture. Its flowers are typically pink or white, with five petals, and bloom in late spring to early summer. Rosa scrupea is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
