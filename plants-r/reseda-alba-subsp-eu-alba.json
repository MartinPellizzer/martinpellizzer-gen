    "intro": "Reseda alba subsp. eu-alba, commonly known as white poppy, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale green stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. The seeds are encased in a hairy, spiny capsule, which aids in their dispersal."
