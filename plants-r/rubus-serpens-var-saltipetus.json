    "intro": "Rubus serpens var. saltipetus, commonly known as the coastal blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to coastal regions of southern California. It is a trailing shrub that produces small, dark purple berries, which are typically consumed by birds and other wildlife. The plant has slender, woody stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to salt spray from the ocean. Its botanical features make it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
