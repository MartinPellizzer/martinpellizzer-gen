    "intro": "Rhus sinuata, commonly known as smooth sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and have serrated margins. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in upright clusters, followed by bright red, fuzzy fruit clusters that mature in the fall. Smooth sumac is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in woodland edges and open areas. Its botanical features make it a notable plant in both ecological and ornamental contexts."
