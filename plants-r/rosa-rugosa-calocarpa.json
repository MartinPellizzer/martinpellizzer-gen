    "intro": "Rosa rugosa calocarpa, commonly known as the coastal rose, is a hardy shrub native to the coastal regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its rugged, thorny stems and dark green, lobed leaves that are adapted to salt-laden environments. The plant produces showy, pink to red flowers in late spring to early summer, which are followed by distinctive orange to red fruits. Its fruit, calocarpa, is edible and has a tart, tangy flavor, often used in jams and preserves. This species is valued for its ornamental beauty and its ability to thrive in challenging coastal conditions."
