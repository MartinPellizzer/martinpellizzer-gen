It is native to the Mediterranean region and is characterized by its basal rosette of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its succulent leaves are adapted to store water, making it drought-tolerant. Rostella major is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and easy care requirements."
