    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus subsp. polyschistus, commonly known as the variable buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist meadows, riverbanks, and woodland edges, preferring well-drained soils. The plant features showy yellow flowers with 5 to 15 sepals that are often notched or lobed, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its leaves are deeply divided into palmate lobes, and the plant produces small, yellowish achenes as fruits. It is known for its variability in leaf and flower morphology, which contributes to its common name."
