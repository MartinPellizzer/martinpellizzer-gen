    "intro": "Rosa canina glabra, commonly known as the smooth hips rose, is a shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its thornless stems and small, oval leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits called hips in autumn. These hips are rich in vitamin C and have been used in traditional medicine. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in hedgerows and woodland edges."
