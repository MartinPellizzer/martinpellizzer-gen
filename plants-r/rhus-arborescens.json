    "intro": "Rhus arborescens, commonly known as smooth sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and turn bright red in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by red, fuzzy berries that are a food source for birds. Smooth sumac thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological benefits in native plant gardens."
