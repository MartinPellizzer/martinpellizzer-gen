    "intro": "Rhacodiscus calycinus, commonly known as the golden globe water lily, is a tropical aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces showy yellow flowers that bloom in the early morning and close by midday. Its roots are submerged, anchoring it in shallow water while absorbing nutrients. Rhacodiscus calycinus is often cultivated in ponds and water gardens for its ornamental value and ability to provide habitat for aquatic life."
