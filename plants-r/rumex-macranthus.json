    "intro": "Rumex macranthus, commonly known as the giant dock, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its roots are thick and fleshy, often used in traditional medicine for their astringent properties. Rumex macranthus thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found along riverbanks and in wet meadows."
