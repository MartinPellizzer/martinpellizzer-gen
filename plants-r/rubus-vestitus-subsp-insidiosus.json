    "intro": "Rubus vestitus subsp. insidiosus, commonly known as the creeping blackberry, is a species of brambles native to parts of North America. It is characterized by its dense, thorny growth habit and dark purple to black berries that ripen in the fall. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and streambanks. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the flowers are white with five petals. The subspecies is distinguished by its hairy stems and relatively smaller fruit size compared to other Rubus species."
