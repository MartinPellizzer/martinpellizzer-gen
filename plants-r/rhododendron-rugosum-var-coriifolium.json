    "intro": "Rhododendron rugosum var. coriifolium, commonly known as the roughleaf azalea, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia, particularly China. It is characterized by its hairy, ovate leaves that are often reddish-brown underneath, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in late spring. It prefers acidic, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance, it is cultivated in various regions with suitable climates."
