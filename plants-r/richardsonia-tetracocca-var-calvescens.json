    "intro": "Richardsonia tetracocca var. calvescens, commonly known as the alpine holly, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its rosette growth habit, with thick, fleshy, and often hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers that are clustered in umbels, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are succulent, adapted to withstand cold temperatures and intense solar radiation. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or alpine settings."
