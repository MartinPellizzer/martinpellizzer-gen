    "intro": "Rosa moschata var. nudiuscula, commonly known as the naked-stem Rosa moschata, is a rare and delicate shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often hairless stems and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces pale pink to white petals and has a compact growth habit, making it a unique addition to specialized gardens. Its leaves are trifoliate, with finely serrated edges, and the plant is adapted to cold, arid environments. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a challenging plant to cultivate outside its native range."
