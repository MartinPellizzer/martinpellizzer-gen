    "intro": "Rubus thamnocharis, commonly known as the marsh raspberry, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is native to South America, particularly found in regions of Argentina, Bolivia, and Chile. This shrub typically grows in wetland or marshy habitats, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. It produces small, aggregate fruits that are often red or yellow in color, which attract various pollinators and seed dispersers. The plant is characterized by its prickly stems and trifoliate leaves, which are typical features of the Rubus genus."
