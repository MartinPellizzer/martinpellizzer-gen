    "intro": "Renanthera micrantha, commonly known as the small-flowered orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows from a rhizomatous pseudobulb, which stores water and nutrients. Its leaves are strap-like and often arranged in a fan shape, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Renanthera micrantha is prized in horticulture for its elegant appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
