    "intro": "Rumex costaricensis, commonly known as the Costa Rican sorrel, is a perennial herb native to Central America. It belongs to the Polygonaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming in the spring. Its leaves are edible and have a tangy, sour flavor due to the presence of oxalic acid. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
