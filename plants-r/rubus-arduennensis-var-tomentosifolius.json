    "intro": "Rubus arduennensis var. tomentosifolius, commonly known as the hairy-leaf blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage, which gives it its common name. The leaves are typically broad and have a distinctive silvery-white underside. The plant produces small, dark purple berries that are edible but not as widely cultivated as other blackberry varieties. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and partial shade."
