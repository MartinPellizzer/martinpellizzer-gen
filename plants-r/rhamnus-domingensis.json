    "intro": "Rhamnus domingensis, commonly known as the Dominican buckthorn, is a shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean, particularly the Dominican Republic. It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are often elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by red or orange berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas or along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
