It is a naturally occurring hybrid between Rosa spinulifolia and other Rosa species, resulting in a plant with unique morphological traits. The leaves are typically oval to elliptical, with a slightly serrated margin, and the flowers are usually pink to red in color. This form is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its beauty and hardiness. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest in both horticultural and taxonomic studies."
