    "intro": "Rorippa sublyrata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved watercress, is a small annual herbaceous plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, alternate leaves that are typically oval to lance-shaped. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are arranged in racemes, which are often borne on the upper parts of the stems. Its flowers are hermaphroditic, meaning they contain both male and female reproductive structures, facilitating self-pollination. Rorippa sublyrata is often found in moist or aquatic habitats, such as stream banks, ditches, and wet meadows."
