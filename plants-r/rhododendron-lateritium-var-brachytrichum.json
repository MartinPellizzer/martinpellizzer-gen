It features dense, evergreen foliage with leathery, dark green leaves that are typically less than 2 inches in length. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to red, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soil and prefers cool, moist environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded conditions."
