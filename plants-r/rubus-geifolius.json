    "intro": "Rubus geifolius, commonly known as the alpine blackberry, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and prickly stems, which are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, dark red berries that are typically harvested in late summer. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three leaflets that are serrated and have a slightly hairy texture. Rubus geifolius is adapted to harsh alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun exposure."
