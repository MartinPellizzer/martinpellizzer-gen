It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its small, rhombic-shaped leaves and clusters of tiny white or pale yellow flowers. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments within tropical forests. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and understudied species."
