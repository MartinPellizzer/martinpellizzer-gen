It is characterized by its pale blue to almost white petals that often take on a subtle reddish tinge at the edges, giving it a unique appearance. This plant is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and thrives in cool, temperate climates. It produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Due to its rarity and aesthetic appeal, it is highly valued in horticulture and botanical collections."
