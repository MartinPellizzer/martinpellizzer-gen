    "intro": "Rhamnus turbinata, commonly known as the Turbaned buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows to a height of 2\u20135 meters and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and opposite, simple leaves that are usually elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by small, round berries that are edible but have a laxative effect. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas, where it contributes to local biodiversity."
