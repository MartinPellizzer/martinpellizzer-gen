    "intro": "Rubus villipes, commonly known as the hairy blackberry, is a species of bramble native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, dark red to black berries. The plant has trifoliate leaves with serrated edges and hairy surfaces, which give it its common name. It thrives in moist, wooded areas and is often found in the understory of forests. The berries are edible, though they are generally considered to have a tart and slightly astringent flavor."
