It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and small, clustered flowers that range from pink to red in color. The plant produces rose hips that are typically orange-red and contain numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or coastal areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant."
