    "intro": "Rhinanthus alectorolophus, commonly known as the red brome, is a flowering plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It is an annual herb that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant produces showy, orange-red flowers that bloom from June to August, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its roots are hemiparasitic, meaning they can derive some nutrients from neighboring plants. Rhinanthus alectorolophus is often found in the UK and parts of Europe, where it plays a role in supporting local biodiversity."
