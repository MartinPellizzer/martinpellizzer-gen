It features dark green, ovate leaves with serrated edges and produces clusters of small, fragrant pink flowers in the summer. The plant is characterized by its dense growth habit and is often found in hedgerows and woodland edges. Its fruit is a red, hairy rosehip that matures in autumn. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in hedging and as a natural barrier."
