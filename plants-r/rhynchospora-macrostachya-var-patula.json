    "intro": "Rhynchospora macrostachya var. patula, commonly known as the narrow-leaved beakspur, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It is a member of the Cyperaceae family, commonly referred to as the sedge family. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that are typically brown or reddish in color. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. This variant is distinguished by its narrower leaves compared to the typical form of R. macrostachya."
