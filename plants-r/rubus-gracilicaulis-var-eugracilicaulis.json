    "intro": "Rubus gracilicaulis var. eugracilicaulis, commonly known as the slender-stemmed blackberry variant, is a shrub native to parts of eastern North America. It is characterized by its thin, wiry stems and small, trifoliate leaves that are typically hairy beneath. The plant produces aggregate fruits composed of tiny, dark red to black drupes that ripen in late summer. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. Its botanical features make it a distinctive member of the Rubus genus, with variations in morphology distinguishing it from other related species."
