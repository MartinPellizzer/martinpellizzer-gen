    "intro": "Rhynchospora echinata, commonly known as the spiny flat sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States. It typically grows in marshes, swamps, and other moist environments, where it thrives in full to partial sunlight. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences with three-lobed flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies that stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species. Rhynchospora echinata is an important component of wetland ecosystems, contributing to biodiversity and ecological balance."
