    "intro": "Rosa communis var. amblyphylla, commonly known as the small-leafed rose, is a cultivar characterized by its compact growth habit and smaller, more rounded leaves compared to typical roses. It produces fragrant, single or semi-double flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, depending on the specific cultivar. The plant is well-suited for container gardening and small spaces due to its manageable size. It prefers well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, and it is relatively disease-resistant. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and ease of care in both garden and landscape settings."
