It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces aggregate fruits, which are typically dark purple to black in color when mature. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or riparian habitats. Due to its ornamental value and potential for edible berries, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
