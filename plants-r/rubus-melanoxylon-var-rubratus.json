    "intro": "Rubus melanoxylon var. rubratus, commonly known as the red-fruited blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry species native to parts of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its dark, almost black stems and leaves, which are typically covered in fine, silvery hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by the development of its distinctive red-tinged fruits. The fruits are usually smaller than standard blackberries and have a tart, slightly sweet flavor. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value as well as for its edible berries."
