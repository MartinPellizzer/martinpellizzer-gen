    "intro": "Reigera maritima, commonly known as the sea reed, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is a perennial herb that thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found along shorelines and salt marshes. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in summer. It plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various small organisms. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects along vulnerable coastlines."
