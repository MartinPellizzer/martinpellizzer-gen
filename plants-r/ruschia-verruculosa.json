    "intro": "Ruschia verruculosa, commonly known as the woolly Ruschia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features compact, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine, white or grayish pubescence, giving it a woolly appearance. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the warmer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Its unique appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
