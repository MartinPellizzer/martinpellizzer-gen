    "intro": "Rhopalostylis, commonly known as the fan palm, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Arecaceae. These plants are native to the Pacific Islands and are characterized by their fan-shaped leaves that radiate from a central stem. Rhopalostylis species typically grow as shrubs or small trees, with some reaching heights of up to 10 meters. They have a fibrous, pithy trunk and produce small, clustered inflorescences. The genus is notable for its ecological importance in coastal and lowland habitats."
