    "intro": "Rhamnus californica var. tomentella, commonly known as the woolyleaf buckthorn, is a shrub native to coastal regions of California. It is characterized by its dense, grayish-white pubescence covering the stems and leaves, which gives it a distinctive, woolly appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by black, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in chaparral and coastal scrub habitats. This variety is notable for its adaptability and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
