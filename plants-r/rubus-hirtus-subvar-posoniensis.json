    "intro": "Rubus hirtus subvar. posoniensis, commonly known as the Posonoi raspberry, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red when ripe, containing multiple drupes. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
