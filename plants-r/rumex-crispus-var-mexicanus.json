    "intro": "Rumex crispus var. mexicanus, commonly known as Mexican dock, is a perennial herb native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States. It features dark green, lance-shaped leaves with a wavy margin and a prominent midrib, often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces tall, erect flowering stems with small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found near streams, roadsides, and in wet meadows. Mexican dock is known for its ability to tolerate a wide range of environmental conditions, making it a common weed in agricultural and natural settings."
