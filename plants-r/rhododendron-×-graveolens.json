    "intro": "Rhododendron \u00d7 graveolens, commonly known as the Chinese rhododendron, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Rhododendron simsii and Rhododendron indicum. It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and showy, funnel-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep pink. The plant thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for shaded garden landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period, typically in spring, and its ability to form thickets, which can provide habitat for wildlife. The species is also valued for its use in traditional Chinese medicine."
