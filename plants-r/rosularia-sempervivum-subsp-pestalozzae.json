    "intro": "Rosularia sempervivum subsp. pestalozzae, commonly known as the Alpine rose or stone rose, is a low-growing succulent with fleshy, rosette-forming leaves. It is native to the alpine regions of Europe and is adapted to rocky, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the summer months. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens and alpine displays. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a hardy choice for gardeners in cooler climates."
