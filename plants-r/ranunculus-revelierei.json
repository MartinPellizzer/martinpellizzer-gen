    "intro": "Ranunculus revelierei, commonly known as the Reveliere's buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family, characterized by its showy, often brightly colored flowers. The plant typically features delicate, palmately divided leaves and produces flowers with five to eight sepals that resemble petals. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
