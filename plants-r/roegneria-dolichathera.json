    "intro": "Roegneria dolichathera, commonly known as the long-haired wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Roegneria dolichathera is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to form dense, low-growing mats."
