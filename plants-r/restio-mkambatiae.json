    "intro": "Restio mkambatiae, commonly known as the Natal restio, is a member of the Restionaceae family, characterized by its grass-like appearance and unique floral structures. It is native to South Africa, particularly found in the coastal regions of KwaZulu-Natal. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically white or pale blue in color. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal dunes or near the shoreline. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
