    "intro": "Rhododendron leptanthum var. warianum, commonly known as the Wari\u00e1n rhododendron, is a rare and striking species native to the mountainous regions of northern Thailand. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range in color from pale pink to deep red, often with a contrasting throat. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments within evergreen forests, preferring well-drained, acidic soils. Its leaves are leathery and elliptical, providing a dense canopy that supports a variety of epiphytic organisms. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
