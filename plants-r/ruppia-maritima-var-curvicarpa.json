    "intro": "Ruppia maritima var. curvicarpa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf seagrass, is a flowering plant species found in coastal and brackish water environments. It is characterized by its narrow, ribbon-like leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in width. This variant is adapted to tolerate varying salinity levels, making it a common inhabitant of estuaries and tidal flats. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are pollinated by wind or water. Its rhizomes form dense underwater mats, contributing to sediment stabilization and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
