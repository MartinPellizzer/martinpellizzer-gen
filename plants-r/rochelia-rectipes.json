    "intro": "Rochelia rectipes, commonly known as the slender sea holly, is a marine alga belonging to the family Rhodophyceae. It is characterized by its erect, branching thallus with a smooth, leathery texture. The plant typically grows in shallow coastal waters, where it attaches to rocky substrates. Its red coloration is due to the presence of phycoerythrin, a pigment common in red algae. Rochelia rectipes plays a vital role in marine ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various marine organisms."
