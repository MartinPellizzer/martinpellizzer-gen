    "intro": "Ranunculus pusillus var. muticus, commonly known as the mute dwarf buttercup, is a small, herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically grows to a height of about 5\u201310 centimeters, featuring delicate, palmately divided leaves and bright yellow flowers with five petals. The plant prefers well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. It is characterized by its reduced floral display compared to other ranunculus species, hence its common name. This variant is less showy but no less valuable in its ecological role within its native environment."
