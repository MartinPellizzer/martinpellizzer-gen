    "intro": "Rhododendron neriiflorum var. agetum, commonly known as the Agetum rhododendron, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, dark green leaves and clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically blooms in late spring, adding a striking visual element to its natural habitat. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is complemented by its relatively low maintenance requirements."
