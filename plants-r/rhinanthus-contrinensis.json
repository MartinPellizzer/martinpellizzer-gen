    "intro": "Rhinanthus contrinensis, commonly known as the Contrin's yellow-rattle, is a flowering plant native to Europe. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellow, tubular flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on other plants for nutrients through its root system. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and heathlands. Rhinanthus contrinensis plays a role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies with its nectar-rich flowers."
