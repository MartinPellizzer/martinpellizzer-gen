    "intro": "Rubia cordifolia f. strigosa, commonly known as the hairy heartleaf madder, is a variant of the Rubia genus native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are densely covered with fine, hairy pubescence. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its roots are rich in rubia, a red dye used historically in textile production. This form is distinguished by its more robust growth and increased pubescence compared to the typical Rubia cordifolia."
