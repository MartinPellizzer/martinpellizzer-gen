    "intro": "Rubus pantocsekianus, commonly known as the Pantocsek's blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and aggregate fruits that develop from multiple small drupes. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in temperate climates. Its leaves are usually trifoliate, with serrated edges, and its flowers are white or pale pink. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and lesser-known member of the Rubus genus."
