    "intro": "Roegneria kronokensis, commonly known as the Alaska bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green blades and tufted growth habit, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Its rhizomatous growth allows it to form dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization. Roegneria kronokensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
