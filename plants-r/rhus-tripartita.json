    "intro": "Rhus tripartita, commonly known as the three-part sumac, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are divided into three distinct leaflets, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by red, fuzzy fruits that attract birds and other wildlife. Its roots are deep and extensive, allowing it to thrive in a variety of soil types and environmental conditions. Rhus tripartita is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
