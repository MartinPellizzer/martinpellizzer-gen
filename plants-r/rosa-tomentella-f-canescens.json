    "intro": "Rosa tomentella f. canescens, commonly known as the silver-haired rock rose, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, silver-white pubescence that covers its stems and leaves, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink to white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in cooler climates."
