    "intro": "Romulea bulbocodium var. grandiflora, commonly known as the giant romulea, is a striking bulbous perennial native to southern Africa. It features showy, spurred flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often with a distinctive hooded shape. The plant produces a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that store water and nutrients. Its bulbs are adapted for survival in arid conditions, allowing it to thrive in rocky or sandy soils. This species is prized in horticulture for its ornamental value and resilience in drought-prone environments."
