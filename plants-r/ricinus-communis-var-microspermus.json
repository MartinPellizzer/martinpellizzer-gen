    "intro": "Ricinus communis var. microspermus, commonly known as the dwarf castor bean, is a variant of the castor oil plant characterized by its smaller seeds and compact growth habit. It is an annual herbaceous plant native to tropical regions, featuring palmate leaves with three to five lobes. The plant produces distinctive spiny capsules that contain toxic seeds, which are used in traditional medicine and as a source of castor oil. It thrives in warm, sunny environments and is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its striking foliage. Due to its toxic properties, it requires careful handling and is not recommended for indoor cultivation without proper precautions."
