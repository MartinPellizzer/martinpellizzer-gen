    "intro": "Ricinus communis f. pruinosus, commonly known as the velvetleaf castor bean, is a variant of the castor oil plant characterized by its distinctive velvety foliage. The leaves are large, palmately lobed, and covered in a dense layer of fine, soft hairs, giving them a tactilely soft appearance. This variety is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its striking foliage rather than for its seeds. It thrives in warm, sunny environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. The plant is also notable for its unique seed pods, which can develop into spiky, reddish structures as they mature."
