    "intro": "Rinorea lindeniana, commonly known as the velvetleaf or silverleaf tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that release seeds when mature. Rinorea lindeniana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
