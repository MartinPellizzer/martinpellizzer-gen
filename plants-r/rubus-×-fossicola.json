It is a natural hybrid between Rubus ursinus (blackberry) and Rubus pectoralis (raspberry), resulting in a plant with unique botanical characteristics. The plant typically grows to a height of 1\u20132 meters, featuring thorny stems and trifoliate leaves with serrated edges. Its flowers are pink to white, and the fruit is a aggregate of drupes, usually dark purple to black when mature. This species is valued for its edible fruit, which has a tart flavor and is commonly used in jams and desserts."
