It is characterized by its silvery-white undersides on its leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, dark berries that are typically edible but have a tart flavor. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and partial shade. Its ornamental value is often appreciated in horticulture due to its attractive foliage and hardy nature."
