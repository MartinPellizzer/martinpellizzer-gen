    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 laxipilus, commonly known as the blackberry raspberry, is a hybrid plant within the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces aggregate fruits composed of small, drupe-like berries that ripen to a dark purple or black color. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland areas or along fence rows. Due to its vigorous growth and adaptability, it is both a valuable food source and a common invasive species in some regions."
