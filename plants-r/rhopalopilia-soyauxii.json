    "intro": "Rhopalopilia soyauxii, commonly known as the Soyaux's cycad, is a rare and ancient plant native to Madagascar. It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and feather-like leaves. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to the unique ecological conditions of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and threats from habitat loss, it is considered endangered."
