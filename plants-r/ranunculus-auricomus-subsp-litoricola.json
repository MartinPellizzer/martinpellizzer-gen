    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus subsp. litoricola, commonly known as the coastal buttercup, is a variant of the broadleaf buttercup native to coastal regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its bright yellow, cup-shaped flowers and heart-shaped leaves, which are typically smaller than those of the typical subspecies. This subspecies thrives in moist, sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines and is often found in dune environments. It is an herbaceous perennial that blooms from late spring to early summer. The plant is adapted to coastal conditions, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils, making it a hardy and resilient species."
