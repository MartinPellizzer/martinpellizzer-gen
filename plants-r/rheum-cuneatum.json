    "intro": "Rheum cuneatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rhubarb, is a perennial herb native to Central Asia. It features large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in length, with a distinctive reddish stem. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the summer months. Its rhubarb-like stalks are edible, though they are typically used in culinary applications rather than medicinal ones. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions."
