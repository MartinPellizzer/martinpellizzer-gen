    "intro": "Rosa vermlandica, commonly known as the Swedish rose, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Scandinavia. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring thorny stems and broad, lobed leaves. The plant produces fragrant, pink to red flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in small, flat-topped inflorescences. Its botanical characteristics include a hairy stem, ovate leaves with serrated edges, and a woody root system adapted to cold climates. Rosa vermlandica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens in cooler regions."
