    "intro": "Rubus dumetorum f. cuneatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, cuneate (wedge-shaped) leaves and small, dark purple to black berries. The plant typically grows in rocky or open woodland habitats, preferring well-drained soils. Its flowers are usually pink or white, and it produces fruit in late summer. This form is often distinguished from other Rubus species by its unique leaf morphology and habitat preferences."
