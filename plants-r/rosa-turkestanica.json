    "intro": "Rosa turkestanica, commonly known as the Central Asian rose, is a species native to Central Asia and parts of the Middle East. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring thorned stems and dark green, lobed leaves. The plant produces fragrant, pink to red flowers in late spring to early summer, which are followed by oval, red-orange hips. Rosa turkestanica is adapted to arid and semi-arid climates, often thriving in well-drained soils. Its flowers and hips are used in traditional medicine and as a source of edible fruit."
