    "intro": "Ranunculus hirtus var. gracilis, commonly known as the slender hairy buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It features delicate, yellow flowers with five to nine petals, often surrounded by a ring of sepals. The plant typically grows in moist meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges, preferring well-drained soil. Its leaves are finely divided and covered with a soft, hairy texture, which gives it its common name. It is an early spring bloomer, often appearing before the canopy of trees fully develops."
