    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 impuripulvis, commonly known as the hybrid blackberry raspberry, is a polyploid plant resulting from the cross between Rubus ursinus (blackberry) and Rubus idaeus (raspberry). It exhibits characteristics of both parent species, with dark red to black berries that are typically larger and more tart than those of pure species. The plant has compound leaves with serrated edges and produces flowers that are usually white or pale pink. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its edible fruits. Its botanical classification reflects its complex genetic heritage, making it a subject of interest in plant taxonomy and horticulture."
