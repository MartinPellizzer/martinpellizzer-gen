    "intro": "Randia hirta, commonly known as rough randia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters. The plant features simple, opposite, and often hairy leaves, which give it its common name. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers are clustered in racemes, and it produces capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Randia hirta is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and open woodlands."
