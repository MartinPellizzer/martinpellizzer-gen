    "intro": "Rorippa brachycarpa, commonly known as the narrow-fruited watercress, is a small, aquatic or semi-aquatic plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and streams, where it thrives in moist, often shallow water environments. The plant has small, alternate leaves that are usually submerged or floating, with bright green, edible leaves that are often used in salads. Its flowers are small and yellow, arranged in racemes, and it produces distinctive, short, club-shaped fruits that are characteristic of the species. Rorippa brachycarpa is a hardy plant that can tolerate a range of water conditions, making it a common sight in temperate regions."
