    "intro": "Renvoizea, commonly known as the golden lily, is a genus of flowering plants native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the family Melanthiaceae and is characterized by its showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in early spring. The plants typically grow in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Renvoizea species are herbaceous perennials with narrow, grass-like leaves and are often found in wetland habitats. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, several species within this genus are considered endangered."
