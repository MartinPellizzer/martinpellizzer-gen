    "intro": "Rubus flosculosus var. flosculosus, commonly known as the pale-flowered raspberry, is a shrub native to parts of eastern North America. It is characterized by its slender, thorny stems and small, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits known as raspberries, which are typically red when ripe. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and thickets. Its botanical features make it a valuable species for ecological studies and native plant gardens."
