    "intro": "Rumex auriculatus, commonly known as the ear-shaped sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Polygonaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive heart-shaped leaves that are often reddish at the base and have a wavy margin. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its rhubarb-like leaves are edible but should be consumed in moderation due to their tart flavor and potential oxalic acid content."
