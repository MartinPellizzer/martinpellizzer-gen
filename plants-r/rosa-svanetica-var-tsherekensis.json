    "intro": "Rosa svanetica var. tsherekensis, commonly known as the Tsherekian rose, is a rare and ornamental species native to the Caucasus region. It is characterized by its fragrant, semi-double pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows as a shrub with thorny stems and dark green, ovate leaves. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for garden cultivation. Due to its limited distribution and conservation status, it is often collected by botanists and horticulturists for study and preservation."
