    "intro": "Rudgea obesiflora, commonly known as the fat-flowered rudgea, is a perennial shrub native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its woody stems and dense clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as tropical forests and riverbanks. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Rudgea obesiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique floral display."
