    "intro": "Ranunculus styriacus, commonly known as the Styrian crowfoot, is a herbaceous perennial native to central Europe. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, palmately divided leaves and showy yellow flowers with numerous stamens. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in woodland or streamside habitats. It blooms from April to June, and its flowers are often visited by bees and other pollinators. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
