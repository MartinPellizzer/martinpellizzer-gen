    "intro": "Rubus polybotrys, commonly known as the Chinese bramble or the mountain raspberry, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, white or pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces edible berries that are typically red or black in color, though they are often too tart for direct consumption. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forested areas. Botanically, it belongs to the Rosaceae family and is notable for its ornamental value and ecological importance."
