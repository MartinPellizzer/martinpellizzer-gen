    "intro": "Rosa sepioides, commonly known as the sea rose, is a rare and unique species native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its striking, dark purple to almost black flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant has a trailing growth habit and produces small, yellowish-green leaves that are adapted to tolerate salty sea air. Its horticultural appeal lies in its dramatic color contrast and ability to thrive in coastal environments. Rosa sepioides is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and resilience to harsh maritime conditions."
