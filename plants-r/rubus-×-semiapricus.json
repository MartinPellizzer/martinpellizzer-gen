    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 semiapricus, commonly known as the blackberry-loganberry hybrid, is a deciduous shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It exhibits characteristics of both blackberries (Rubus ursinus) and loganberries (Rubus istrorum), combining the thorny stems and compound leaves of its parent species. The plant produces large, dark purple to black fruits that are typically sweeter and juicier than those of pure blackberries. Its flowers are white with five petals and are typically borne in clusters at the base of the leaves. The plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
