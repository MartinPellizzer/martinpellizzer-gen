    "intro": "Rumicastrum dispermum, commonly known as the two-seeded burrplant, is a species of flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its prickly, woody stems and capsule fruits. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by the development of spiny, two-seeded pods. Its botanical features make it well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, where it thrives in sandy or rocky soils."
