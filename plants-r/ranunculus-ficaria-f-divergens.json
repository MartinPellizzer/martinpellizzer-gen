    "intro": "Ranunculus ficaria f. divergens, commonly known as the broadleaf buttercup, is a variant of the buttercup species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive dark green color and bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its flowers have five petals and are often surrounded by a cluster of small, white sepals. The f. divergens form is characterized by its broader leaves compared to the typical species, making it easily distinguishable in botanical studies."
