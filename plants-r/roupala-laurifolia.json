    "intro": "Roupala laurifolia, commonly known as the shining tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its smooth, dark green, lance-shaped leaves that are glossy and arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that contains several seeds. Roupala laurifolia is often found in coastal and lowland forest habitats, where it contributes to the ecological diversity of its native environment."
