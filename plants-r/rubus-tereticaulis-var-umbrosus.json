    "intro": "Rubus tereticaulis var. umbrosus, commonly known as the dark raspberry or shadow raspberry, is a perennial shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its erect or spreading growth habit and produces small, dark red berries that are typically tart and less commonly consumed by humans. The plant features trifoliate leaves with serrated edges and has thorny stems, which are typical of many Rubus species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks, often forming dense thickets. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a food source for wildlife and its contribution to the ecological diversity of its habitat."
