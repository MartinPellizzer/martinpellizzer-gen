    "intro": "Rosa \u00d7 centifolia var. versicolor, commonly known as the multibract rose or the pinkie rose, is a hybrid cultivar prized for its ornamental value. It is characterized by its profuse, fragrant blooms that range from pale pink to white, often with a subtle color variation across the petals. The plant is a deciduous shrub that produces multiple flowers on each stem, typically in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are compound, consisting of five to seven oval-shaped leaflets, and it thrives in well-drained soil with full sun exposure. This variety is also noted for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
