It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves, which are typical of many bramble species. The plant produces aggregate fruits, known as drupes, which are typically dark purple to black in color. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along woodland edges. Due to its vigorous growth, it can become invasive in certain regions."
