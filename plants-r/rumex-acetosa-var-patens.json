It features basal leaves that are broad, lobed, and often covered in fine hairs, with a distinctive reddish stem. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in dense clusters during the summer months. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along riverbanks. Its leaves have been historically used in traditional medicine and as a vegetable."
