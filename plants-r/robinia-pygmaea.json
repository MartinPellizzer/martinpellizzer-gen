    "intro": "Robinia pygmaea, commonly known as the burr oak, is a small, deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 6 to 12 inches long and composed of 15 to 30 oval-shaped leaflets. The tree produces distinctive, spiny burr-like fruits that contain one or two seeds. Its bark is thick, deeply furrowed, and often flaky, providing a rugged appearance. Robinia pygmaea is valued for its hard, heavy wood and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
