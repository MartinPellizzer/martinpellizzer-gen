    "intro": "Rafflesia tuanku-halimii, commonly known as the King's Crown Rafflesia, is a rare and striking plant found in the rainforests of Borneo. It is notable for producing the largest individual flower in the world, which can reach up to 1 meter in diameter. The plant is a parasitic species that lacks leaves, stems, and roots, relying entirely on its host plant for nutrients. Its flowers emit a strong, unpleasant odor resembling decaying meat, which attracts flies and other insects for pollination. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered critically endangered and is a symbol of Borneo's unique biodiversity."
