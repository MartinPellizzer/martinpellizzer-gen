    "intro": "Rondeletia intermedia, commonly known as the golden flame or red rondeletia, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring opposite, ovate leaves with a glossy dark green surface. The plant produces clusters of tubular, brightly colored flowers, usually in shades of red, orange, or yellow, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its flowers are adapted for pollination by birds, particularly hummingbirds, due to their shape and nectar-rich structure. Rondeletia intermedia is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant display and ability to thrive in well-drained soil."
