    "intro": "Rumex acetosella var. divergens, commonly known as sheep's sorrel, is a low-growing perennial herb native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features trifoliate leaves with serrated edges and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodland floors, meadows, and along stream banks. It is characterized by its ability to form dense mats and its use in traditional herbal medicine. The variant 'divergens' is distinguished by its slightly different leaf morphology compared to the typical form of Rumex acetosella."
