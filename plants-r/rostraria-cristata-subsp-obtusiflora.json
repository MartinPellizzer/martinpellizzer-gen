    "intro": "Rostraria cristata subsp. obtusiflora, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rostraria, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive rosette growth form and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typical of the Apiaceae family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in cloud forests or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change."
