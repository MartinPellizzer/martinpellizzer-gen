    "intro": "Rhododendron polifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage with broad, leathery leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to white, blooming in late spring. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is complemented by its ability to form thickets, contributing to ecological stability in its native habitats."
