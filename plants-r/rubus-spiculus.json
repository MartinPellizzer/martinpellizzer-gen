    "intro": "Rubus spiculus, commonly known as the prickly blackberry, is a species of bramble native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black when mature. It thrives in woodland edges, hedgerows, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Due to its hardy nature, it is often found in temperate climates and can be invasive in certain regions."
