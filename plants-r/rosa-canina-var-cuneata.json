    "intro": "Rosa canina var. cuneata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf dog rose, is a variant of the common dog rose. It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its slender, often thornless stems and narrow, elliptical leaves. The plant produces fragrant, pink to white flowers in late spring, followed by orange-red hips that are rich in vitamin C. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in woodland edges and hedgerows. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal medicine."
