    "intro": "Ranunculus nyalamensis var. nyalamensis, commonly known as the Nyalam buttercup, is a flowering plant native to the Himalayan region of Nepal. It is characterized by its delicate, yellow flowers with five petals and a hairy stem. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky habitats at high altitudes. Its leaves are palmately lobed and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its cool, arid environment. This species is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations and limited distribution."
