It features dense, mat-forming growth with small, dark green leaves and produces clusters of fragrant, pale pink to white flowers. The plant is characterized by its thornless stems and is often cultivated as a ground cover or in rock gardens. Its botanical features make it well-suited for harsh climates and poor soils. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in challenging environmental conditions."
