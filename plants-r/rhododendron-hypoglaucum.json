    "intro": "Rhododendron hypoglaucum, commonly known as the silverleaf rhododendron, is a deciduous shrub native to the Himalayas. It typically grows at elevations between 2,000 and 4,000 meters, thriving in cool, moist environments. The plant features elliptical, dark green leaves that are covered in a silvery-white bloom on the underside. Its flowers are usually pink to red, appearing in clusters and blooming in late spring to early summer. Rhododendron hypoglaucum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with acidic soil and partial shade."
