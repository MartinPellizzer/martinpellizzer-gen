    "intro": "Ranunculus lejospermus, commonly known as the alpine buttercup, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family, characterized by its showy, often yellow or white flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are deeply lobed, and the flowers consist of several sepals that resemble petals. The fruit is a follicle that releases seeds through a unique mechanism, aiding in its dispersal in high-altitude habitats."
