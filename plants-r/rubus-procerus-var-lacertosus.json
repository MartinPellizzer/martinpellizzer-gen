    "intro": "Rubus procerus var. lacertosus, commonly known as the long-hair bramble, is a variant of the bramble genus Rubus native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, thorny growth habit and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits known as drupes, which are typically red or black in color. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils. Due to its hardy nature, it plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for birds and insects."
