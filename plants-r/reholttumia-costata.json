    "intro": "Reholttumia costata, commonly known as the coastal sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its robust, upright growth habit and its striking, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of salt-tolerant wax. Reholttumia costata thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to saline and wind-exposed environments. It is often used in coastal gardens for its ornamental value and hardiness."
