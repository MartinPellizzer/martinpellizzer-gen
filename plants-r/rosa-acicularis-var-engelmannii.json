    "intro": "Rosa acicularis var. engelmannii, commonly known as the Engelmann's prickly rose, is a variant of the acicular rose native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its sharp, thorned stems and small, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or white. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along canyon walls. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several narrow, pointed leaflets, and it produces edible, though somewhat tart, rose hips in the fall. This species is well adapted to drought conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
