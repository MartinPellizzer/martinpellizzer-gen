    "intro": "Rumex balcanicus, commonly known as Balkan sorrel, is a perennial herb native to the Balkan Peninsula. It belongs to the Polygonaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive leaves with a reddish underside. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its rhubarb-like leaves are edible but should be consumed in moderation due to their high oxalic acid content. Rumex balcanicus thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas and along stream banks."
