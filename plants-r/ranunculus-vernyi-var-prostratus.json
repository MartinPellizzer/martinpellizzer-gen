    "intro": "Ranunculus vernyi var. prostratus, commonly known as the prostrate meadow buttercup, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically features a mat-forming growth habit with numerous small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has finely divided, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along streambanks. Due to its delicate appearance and early blooming period, it is a valuable species for pollinators and adds aesthetic value to natural habitats."
