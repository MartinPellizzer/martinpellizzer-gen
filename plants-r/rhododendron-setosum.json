    "intro": "Rhododendron setosum, commonly known as the woolly rhododendron, is a species native to the Himalayas, particularly in regions of India, Nepal, and Bhutan. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and showy, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils and prefers shaded to semi-shaded environments. Its leaves are leathery and covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in high-altitude conditions. Rhododendron setosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological diversity of its native habitats."
