    "intro": "Rhodanthe immaculata, commonly known as the white everlasting, is a flowering plant native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is often found in open habitats such as roadsides and sandy soils. It is a member of the daisy family (Asteraceae) and is known for its long-lasting flowers that retain their shape and color when dried. Rhodanthe immaculata is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in gardens for its aesthetic and hardy nature."
