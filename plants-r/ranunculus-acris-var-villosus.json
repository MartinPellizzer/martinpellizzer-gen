It features a basal rosette of hairy, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered with fine, soft hairs. The plant produces showy yellow flowers with five petals, typically appearing in early spring. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Due to its hairy foliage and striking blooms, it is a popular ornamental plant in gardens."
