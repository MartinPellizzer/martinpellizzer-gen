    "intro": "Rhinanthus songaricus, commonly known as the Siberian touch-me-not, is a flowering plant native to Central Asia. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from the roots of other plants. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as grasslands and sandy soils. Its unique appearance and ecological role make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
