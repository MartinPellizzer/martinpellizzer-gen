    "intro": "Ricinella pedunculosa var. grandifolia, commonly known as the large-flowered ricinella, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Araceae, characterized by its inflorescence known as a spadix, surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers clustered around the spadix, with the spathe often displaying vibrant colors to attract pollinators. Its leaves are typically broad and arrow-shaped, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its striking floral display."
