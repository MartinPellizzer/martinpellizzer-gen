    "intro": "Rumex \u00d7 warrenii, commonly known as the hybrid sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Polygonaceae family. It is a naturally occurring hybrid between Rumex acetosa (common sorrel) and Rumex acetobulus (broadleaf sorrel). The plant typically has heart-shaped leaves with a reddish or purple coloration on the veins, and it produces small, greenish flowers in clusters. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wet meadows or along stream banks. Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits a range of morphological variations depending on its parent species."
