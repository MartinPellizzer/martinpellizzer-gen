It has narrow, strap-like leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along its stem. The plant produces small, white flowers that are often submerged, with stamens and pistils positioned near the base of the flower. It thrives in shallow, slow-moving waters and is often found in marshes and ponds. This species plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
