    "intro": "Rhynchospora umbraticola var. kuntzei, commonly known as the shadowy flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland and swampy habitats in the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce numerous tiny flowers. The plant typically grows in dense clusters, often forming a mat-like structure that helps stabilize soil in moist environments. It prefers partial to full shade and is adapted to nutrient-poor, waterlogged soils. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species within its range."
