    "intro": "Rottboellia caespitosa, commonly known as buffalo grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Americas. It forms dense, clump-like growths with slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for erosion control. Its low-growing habit and fine texture make it a popular choice for ornamental and lawn purposes."
