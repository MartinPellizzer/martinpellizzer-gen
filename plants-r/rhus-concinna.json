    "intro": "Rhus concinna, commonly known as smooth sumac, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged with serrated leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in panicles, followed by red, fuzzy fruits that are a common food source for birds. Smooth sumac is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in open woods, fields, and along roadsides. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed areas make it an important pioneer species in ecological succession."
