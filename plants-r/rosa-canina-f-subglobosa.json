    "intro": "Rosa canina f. subglobosa, commonly known as the globe rose, is a cultivated form of the dog rose. It is characterized by its rounded, compact growth habit and smaller, more densely packed flowers compared to the typical Rosa canina. The plant produces small, red-orange hips that are often used in herbal remedies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for garden cultivation. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its persistent foliage and attractive fruiting structures."
