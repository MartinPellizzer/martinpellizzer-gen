It is characterized by its dark purple to black berries, which are typically larger and more intensely flavored than those of other Rubus species. The plant produces compound leaves with serrated edges and has thorny stems typical of many brambles. It thrives in temperate climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. This variety is valued for its culinary use in jams, desserts, and as a fresh fruit."
