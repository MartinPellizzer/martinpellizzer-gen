    "intro": "Rubus pugiunculosus, commonly known as the alpine raspberry, is a species of bramble native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a shrub with thorny stems and compound leaves that are typically small and serrated. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are usually red or orange in color, similar to other raspberries. It thrives in alpine environments, often growing at high elevations where the climate is cool and the soil is well-drained. Due to its limited range and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
