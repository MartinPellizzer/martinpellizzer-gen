    "intro": "Rhus copallinum f. angustialata, commonly known as narrowleaf sumac, is a shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is a variant of the common sumac, characterized by its narrower, more lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, fuzzy berries in the fall. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine and as a dye source. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and open areas."
