It is characterized by its large, glossy, ovate leaves with a pointed tip, which give it its subspecific name \"acuminata.\" The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences, followed by reddish-brown berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its attractive foliage. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for indoor gardening and tropical landscapes."
