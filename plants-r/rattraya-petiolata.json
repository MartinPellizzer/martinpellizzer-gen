    "intro": "Rattraya petiolata, commonly known as the broad-leafed morning glory, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces small, round berries that turn red when mature. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges. Its rapid growth and ornamental flowers make it both a popular garden plant and a potential invasive species in some areas."
