    "intro": "Rumex salicifolius var. trigranis, commonly known as the three-seed dock, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features basal leaves that are broad, heart-shaped, and have a rough, serrated edge, while its upper leaves are narrower and more elongated. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish flowers that are arranged in dense, terminal spikes. Its fruit is a three-lobed, winged achene, which aids in wind dispersal. The plant is often found in moist, calcareous soils along stream banks and in woodland edges."
