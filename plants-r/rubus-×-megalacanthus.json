    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 megalacanthus, commonly known as the giant blackberry, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Rubus ursinus (slippery elm) and Rubus fruticosus (common bramble). It is characterized by its large, dark purple to black berries that are often used in culinary applications. The plant produces thorny stems and has trifoliate leaves with serrated edges. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland areas or along hedgerows. Its botanical features make it both a useful and ornamental plant in horticulture."
