    "intro": "Rubus lechleri, commonly known as the \"dragon's blood tree,\" is a species of bramble native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its dark purple to red latex, which has been used for centuries by indigenous peoples for medicinal and dyeing purposes. The plant produces small, white flowers and red, hairy fruits that are often consumed by wildlife. Its leaves are trifoliate, with a serrated margin, and the plant thrives in humid, tropical environments. Due to habitat loss, Rubus lechleri is considered endangered, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival."
