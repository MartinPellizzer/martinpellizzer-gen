    "intro": "Rosa ramealis, commonly known as the whitebeam rose, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves with five to seven leaflets, and it produces small, white to pink flowers in the spring. The plant is typically found in woodlands and along stream banks, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Its fruit is a red, follicle-like structure that contains several seeds, and it plays a role in supporting local wildlife. Rosa ramealis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in hedgerows."
