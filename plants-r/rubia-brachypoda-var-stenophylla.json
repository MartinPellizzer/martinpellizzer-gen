    "intro": "Rubia brachypoda var. stenophylla, commonly known as narrow-leaved bedstraw, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes many flowering plants known for their medicinal and aromatic properties. The plant is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, arranged in clusters, and bloom in early summer. This variant is distinguished by its narrower leaves compared to other Rubia species, making it a unique and identifiable member of the genus."
