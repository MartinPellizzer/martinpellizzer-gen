    "intro": "Rubus confluentinus, commonly known as the clustered blackberry, is a species of brambles native to the western United States. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and thorny stems, typical of many Rubus species. The plant produces aggregate fruits, which are dark purple to black when mature, and are often consumed by wildlife. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the flowers are white with five petals. This species is often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and streambanks."
