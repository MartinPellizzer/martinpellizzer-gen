    "intro": "Rosa glauca var. gemina, commonly known as the twin blue rose, is a rare and striking variant of the blue rose. This plant is characterized by its pale blue to lavender-colored flowers, which are more intensely pigmented than those of the typical Rosa glauca. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows in alpine or subalpine regions, preferring well-drained soils and full sun. The plant's foliage is dark green and often covered in a fine, silvery down, adding to its ornamental appeal. Due to its rarity and unique appearance, it is highly sought after by botanists and horticulturists alike."
