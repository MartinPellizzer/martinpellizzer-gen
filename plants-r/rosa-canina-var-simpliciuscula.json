    "intro": "Rosa canina var. simpliciuscula, commonly known as the lesser dog rose, is a rare variant of the dog rose, characterized by its smaller flowers and more compact growth habit. It is a deciduous shrub native to parts of Europe and western Asia, typically found in woodland edges and open habitats. The plant produces pale pink to white flowers with five petals, followed by red, fuzzy hips that are rich in vitamin C. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with serrated leaflets, and it has thorned stems typical of the Rosa genus. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often considered a botanical curiosity and is of interest to horticulturists and conservationists."
