It is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers with five to nine sepals that resemble petals, and its basal leaves that are palmately lobed. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as tundra, wet meadows, and rocky slopes. It has a short growing season and is adapted to cold climates with a deep root system for nutrient uptake. Its botanical features make it an important component of alpine and arctic ecosystems."
