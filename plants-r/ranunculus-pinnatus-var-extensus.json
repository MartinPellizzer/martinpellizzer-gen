It features finely divided, fern-like leaves and produces showy, yellow flowers with numerous petals. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Its flowers are short-lived but attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The species is valued for its ornamental qualities in gardens and its historical use in traditional medicine."
