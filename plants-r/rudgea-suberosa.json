    "intro": "Rudgea suberosa, commonly known as the roughleaf rudgea, is a shrub native to the temperate regions of South America. It is characterized by its woody stems and lance-shaped leaves with a rough, textured surface. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its flowers are typically followed by small, berry-like fruits that are edible for some bird species. Rudgea suberosa is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and rocky slopes."
