    "intro": "Rosa moschata var. longicuspis, commonly known as the long-spined musk rose, is a variant of the musk rose species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its fragrant, pinkish-white flowers and thorny stems, which are typical features of many rose species. The plant produces small, red, edible fruits known as hips, which are often used in traditional medicine and culinary applications. Its leaves are compound, with five to seven oval-shaped leaflets, and it thrives in well-drained soil with full sun exposure. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in perfumery due to its aromatic properties."
