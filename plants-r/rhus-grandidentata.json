    "intro": "Rhus grandidentata, commonly known as the staghorn sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged with large, serrated leaflets. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into red, fuzzy berries in the fall. Its bark is rough and fissured, often appearing rugged and horn-like, which gives it its common name. Rhus grandidentata is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in open woodlands and disturbed areas."
