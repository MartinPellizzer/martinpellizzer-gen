    "intro": "Ranunculus garganicus, commonly known as the Garganic buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in wet meadows and stream banks. The plant features a basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves and produces showy, yellow flowers with five to nine petals. It blooms from late spring to early summer, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
