    "intro": "Rhopalopilia marquesii, commonly known as the Marquesas spider-orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the Marquesas Islands in French Polynesia. It is characterized by its unique, spider-like appearance, with long, thin sepals and petals that resemble delicate filaments. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments within the tropical rainforests of its native habitat. It produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom during the warmer months, attracting specific pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a vulnerable species."
