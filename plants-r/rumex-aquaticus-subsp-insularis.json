    "intro": "Rumex aquaticus subsp. insularis, commonly known as the island sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to certain island regions. It typically grows in wetland or marshy habitats, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant features broad, arrow-shaped leaves with a distinctive reddish or purple underside, and it produces small, greenish flowers in clusters. It is characterized by its ability to tolerate waterlogged conditions, making it an important species in aquatic ecosystems. Due to its limited distribution, it is often considered a rare or endangered plant in its native range."
