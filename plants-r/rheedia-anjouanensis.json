    "intro": "Rheedia anjouanensis, commonly known as the Anjouan rheedia, is a flowering plant native to the Comoros Islands. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit. The plant features palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, and it produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters. Rheedia anjouanensis is typically found in coastal and lowland areas, thriving in humid, tropical climates. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially vulnerable species."
