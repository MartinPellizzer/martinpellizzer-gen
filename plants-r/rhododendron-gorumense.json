It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments at elevations between 1,000 and 2,500 meters. Its leaves are leathery and glossy, with a pointed shape, and it produces small, clustered flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.
