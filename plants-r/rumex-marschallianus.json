    "intro": "Rumex marschallianus, commonly known as marsh sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Polygonaceae family. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are typically reddish or purple-veined, and its clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. It is known for its edible leaves, which have a tangy, sour flavor due to the presence of oxalic acid. However, it should be consumed in moderation as excessive intake may cause health issues."
