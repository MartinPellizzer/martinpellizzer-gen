    "intro": "Rosa tomentosa f. prolifera, commonly known as the woolly rose or creeping rose, is a compact, shrub-like plant characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, white tomentum, giving the plant a fuzzy appearance. The flowers are typically pink to red, with five petals and a prominent, hairy center. This variety is well-suited for rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its low-growing nature and ability to spread through stolons. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy and versatile addition to many garden settings."
