It is characterized by its bright yellow, shield-shaped flowers and trifoliate leaves. The subspecies is distinguished by its smooth, hairless stems and leaves, which set it apart from other members of the Ranunculus genus. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in local ecosystems by supporting pollinators."
