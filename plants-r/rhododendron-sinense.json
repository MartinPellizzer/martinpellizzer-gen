    "intro": "Rhododendron sinense, commonly known as the Chinese rhododendron, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It features showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and red, typically blooming in late spring. The plant has broad, ovate leaves that are often hairy beneath, and it produces small, leathery berries that contain seeds. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens. Rhododendron sinense is also valued for its ecological role in supporting local wildlife and its historical use in traditional Chinese medicine."
