    "intro": "Rosa corymbifera var. zebeldensis, commonly known as the Zebeldens rose, is a rare and ornamental shrub native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its fragrant, semi-double pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features thorny stems and dark green, serrated leaves that provide a lush backdrop to its showy blooms. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for garden cultivation in temperate climates. Due to its limited natural range and ornamental value, it is often sought after by horticulturists and botanists."
