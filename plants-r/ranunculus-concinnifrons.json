    "intro": "Ranunculus concinnifrons, commonly known as the narrow-leaved buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a basal rosette of deeply lobed, serrated leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with five petals and numerous stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain environments."
