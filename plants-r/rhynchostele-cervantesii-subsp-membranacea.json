    "intro": "Rhynchostele cervantesii subsp. membranacea, commonly known as the Mexican spiny scale tree, is a rare and unique plant native to the high-altitude regions of Mexico. It belongs to the family Meliaceae, which includes mahogany and related hardwoods. The plant is characterized by its distinctive spiny leaves and a woody stem with a complex, hollow central vascular structure known as a rhynchostele. Its leaves are typically small,\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), and have a dense arrangement, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
