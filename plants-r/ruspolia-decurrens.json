    "intro": "Ruspolia decurrens, commonly known as the creeping lily or the rock lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped, often hairy leaves that form a dense mat. The plant produces slender, upright stems that bear showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for Mediterranean climates. Its flowers bloom from spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
