    "intro": "Ranunculus cardiophyllus, commonly known as the heart-leaved buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its basal leaves that are deeply lobed and heart-shaped, giving it its common name. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with five petals that bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens but is also considered a weed in some agricultural settings."
