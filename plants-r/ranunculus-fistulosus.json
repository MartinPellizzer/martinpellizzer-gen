    "intro": "Ranunculus fistulosus, commonly known as the slender buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist meadows, marshes, and along stream banks, preferring damp, well-drained soils. The plant features a basal rosette of heart-shaped, finely toothed leaves and produces showy, yellow flowers with five petals. Its flowers are often accompanied by numerous stamens, giving them a distinctive, fluffy appearance. Ranunculus fistulosus is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain environments."
