    "intro": "Rutidea kimuenzae, commonly known as the Kimuenzae legume, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America, particularly in Ecuador. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its distinctive pod fruits and nitrogen-fixing abilities. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments and has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, displaying a range of colors from white to pink, depending on the species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Rutidea kimuenzae is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
