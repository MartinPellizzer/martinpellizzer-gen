    "intro": "Restio cuspidatus, commonly known as the spike restio, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Restionaceae family, which includes many grass-like plants adapted to arid and coastal environments. The plant is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and tall, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, white or pale blue flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in fynbos vegetation. Restio cuspidatus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
