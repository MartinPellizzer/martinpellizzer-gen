    "intro": "Rumex fueginus, commonly known as the Andean sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Andes mountains of South America. It features upright, hairy stems and basal leaves that are oval to lance-shaped with serrated edges. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are edible and have a tangy, sour flavor due to the presence of oxalic acid. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions at high altitudes."
