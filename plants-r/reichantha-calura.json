    "intro": "Reichantha calura, commonly known as the golden star orchid, is a striking epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It features a compact, pseudobulbous structure with clustered, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces showy, yellowish-orange flowers with a distinctive star-shaped pattern on the petals and sepals. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, loose potting media. Reichantha calura is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
