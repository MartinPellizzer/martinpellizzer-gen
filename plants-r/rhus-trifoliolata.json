    "intro": "Rhus trifoliolata, commonly known as the three-leaved sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which typically consist of three leaflets, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by red, fuzzy berries that are a food source for birds and wildlife. Its bark is smooth and reddish-brown, and it often grows in moist, wooded areas. Rhus trifoliolata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native landscapes."
