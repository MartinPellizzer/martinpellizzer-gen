    "intro": "Rhus punjabensis, commonly known as the Indian sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Indian subcontinent. It belongs to the Anacardiaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves that turn vibrant red in the autumn. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by orange-red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in forest margins and scrublands. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for horticultural use in arid regions."
