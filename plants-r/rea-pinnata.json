    "intro": "Rea pinnata, commonly known as the red maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its opposite, pinnately compound leaves that turn vibrant red in the fall. The tree produces small, red flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras as its fruit. Its bark is smooth and gray when young, becoming furrowed with age. Rea pinnata is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological importance in forest ecosystems."
