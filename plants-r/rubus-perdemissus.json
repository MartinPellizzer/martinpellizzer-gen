    "intro": "Rubus perdemissus, commonly known as the Japanese blackberry, is a species of bramble native to East Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark red to black in color. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions. Due to its invasive potential, it is often considered a problematic weed in non-native regions."
