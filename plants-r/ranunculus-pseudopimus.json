    "intro": "Ranunculus pseudopimus, commonly known as the alpine buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of pinnately lobed leaves and produces showy, yellow flowers with five petals. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. It is a member of the Ranunculaceae family, known for its often toxic sap and showy blooms. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native habitat."
