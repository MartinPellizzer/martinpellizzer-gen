    "intro": "Rhododendron alborugosum, commonly known as the white-veined rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, leathery leaves that are typically white-veined, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to white, blooming in late spring. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and requires partial to full sunlight. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical gardens."
