    "intro": "Ricinocarpus monostachyus, commonly known as the sea hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Indo-Pacific. It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along shorelines. The plant features showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are usually pink or red in color. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant is adapted to saline environments and plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes."
