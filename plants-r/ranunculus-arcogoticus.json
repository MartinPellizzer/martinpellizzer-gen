It is characterized by its bright yellow, cup-shaped flowers and pinnately divided leaves. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky habitats, thriving in cool, moist environments. It is a perennial species that produces a basal rosette of leaves and has a short, sturdy stem. The flowers bloom in spring and are pollinated by insects, contributing to the ecological diversity of its native habitat."
