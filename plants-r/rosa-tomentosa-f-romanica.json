    "intro": "Rosa tomentosa f. romanica, commonly known as the Romanica rose, is a compact, bushy shrub native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It features dense, grayish-white pubescent foliage that gives it a distinctive, woolly appearance. The plant produces fragrant, semi-double pink flowers with a soft, velvety texture. It is well-suited for rock gardens and borders due to its compact size and ornamental value. This cultivar is prized for its hardiness and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
