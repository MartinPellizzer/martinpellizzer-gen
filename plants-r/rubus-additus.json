It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or black in color. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and full sunlight. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native habitat."
