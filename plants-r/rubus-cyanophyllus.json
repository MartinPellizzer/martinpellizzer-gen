    "intro": "Rubus cyanophyllus, commonly known as the blue-leaf raspberry, is a species of bramble native to the temperate regions of the Pacific Northwest. It is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves and clusters of small, pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces red, hairy berries that are typically harvested in the fall. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and unique coloration, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
