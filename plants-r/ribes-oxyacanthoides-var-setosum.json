It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces edible red berries that ripen in late summer, making it a valuable food source for birds and wildlife. Its leaves are elliptical with serrated edges and are covered in fine, hairy pubescence. This variety is often found in moist, shaded woodlands and is well adapted to cooler climates."
