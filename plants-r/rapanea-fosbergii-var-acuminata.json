    "intro": "Rapanea fosbergii var. acuminata, commonly known as Fosberg\u2019s rapanea, is a rare shrub native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its evergreen leaves, which are elliptical and have a smooth, glossy surface. The plant produces small, white flowers arranged in clusters, followed by dark purple berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in montane rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
