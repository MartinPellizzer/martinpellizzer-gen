    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus subsp. fallacillus, commonly known as the yellow pond-lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its palmately divided leaves and showy, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in wetlands, ponds, and slow-moving streams, thriving in aquatic or semi-aquatic environments. Its flowers are often surrounded by a ring of leaf-like structures, and it produces small, hairy fruits that disperse via water. The species is notable for its ecological importance in supporting aquatic insect populations and maintaining wetland biodiversity."
