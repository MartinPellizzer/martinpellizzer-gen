    "intro": "Roegneria racemifera var. hackeliana, commonly known as the Hackel's wheatgrass, is a cool-season grass native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are often covered with a fine layer of hairs. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, two-lobed spikelets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in challenging environments."
