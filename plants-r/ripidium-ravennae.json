    "intro": "Ripidium ravennae, commonly known as the Ravennan rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, often forming dense clumps with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences, which bloom in late summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and colonize wetland areas effectively. Ripidium ravennae plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates in its native environment."
