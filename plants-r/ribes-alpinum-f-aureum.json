    "intro": "Ribes alpinum f. aureum, commonly known as the golden currant, is a compact shrub native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features small, oval leaves that are densely covered with fine, golden-yellow hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in early summer, which are followed by small, edible berries. It thrives in well-drained, sunny soils and is often found in rocky or mountainous habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and alpine landscapes."
