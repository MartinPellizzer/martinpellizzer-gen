    "intro": "Reldia minutiflora var. minutiflora, commonly known as the dwarf reldia, is a small flowering plant native to tropical regions. It features delicate, tiny white flowers that bloom in clusters, adding a subtle ornamental appeal. The plant has slender, upright stems and lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its compact size and unique appearance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
