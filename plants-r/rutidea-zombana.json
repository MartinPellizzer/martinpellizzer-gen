    "intro": "Rutidea zombana, commonly known as the zombie flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the humid rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its striking, bioluminescent petals that glow faintly in the dark, a feature that has sparked much scientific curiosity. The plant's unique ability to emit light is attributed to specialized structures within its petals that produce and store bioluminescent compounds. Rutidea zombana thrives in shaded, nutrient-rich soils and is often found growing near decaying organic matter. Due to its elusive nature and limited distribution, it remains a subject of ongoing botanical research."
