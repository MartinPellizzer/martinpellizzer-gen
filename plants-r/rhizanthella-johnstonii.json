    "intro": "Rhizanthella johnstonii, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and unique flowering plant native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is a terrestrial orchid that lacks leaves and instead absorbs nutrients through its roots, which form a symbiotic relationship with fungi. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom directly from the ground, making it difficult to spot in its natural habitat. Due to its elusive nature and limited distribution, it is considered one of the most endangered plant species in the world. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this rare botanical wonder from habitat loss and environmental threats."
