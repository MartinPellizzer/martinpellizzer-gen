    "intro": "Rosa rhaetica var. levieri, commonly known as the Rhaetian rose, is a rare and striking subshrub native to the Alps. It features dense, dark green foliage and produces showy, pink to red flowers with a strong, sweet fragrance. The plant is characterized by its woody stems and thorny growth habit, typical of many rose species. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
