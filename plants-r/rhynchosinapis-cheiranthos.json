It is a member of the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and bright yellow flowers. The plant has hairy, linear leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Rhynchosinapis cheiranthos is adapted to sandy soils and can thrive in full sun, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems."
