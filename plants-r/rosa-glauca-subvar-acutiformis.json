    "intro": "Rosa glauca subvar. acutiformis, commonly known as the sharp-leafed blue rose, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, thornless stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically a silvery-blue hue. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pale pink to white, often with a faint blue tint. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is a prized addition to botanical gardens and specialty collections."
