    "intro": "Rubus vapillonii, commonly known as the Pacific blackberry, is a species of brambles native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and thorny stems, typical of many Rubus species. The plant produces aggregate fruits, which are typically dark purple to black when mature, and are often covered in a fine layer of white bloom. Its leaves are palmately lobed and have a serrated margin, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and is also used in local ecosystems as a food source for wildlife."
