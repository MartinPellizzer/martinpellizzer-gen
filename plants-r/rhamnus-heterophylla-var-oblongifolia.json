    "intro": "Rhamnus heterophylla var. oblongifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf buckthorn, is a shrub native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has slender, often branched stems. The leaves are alternate, simple, and usually elliptical or oblong in shape, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Its small, greenish-yellow flowers appear in clusters and are followed by small, fleshy berries that are an important food source for birds. The plant has a deep root system that helps stabilize soil in arid environments."
