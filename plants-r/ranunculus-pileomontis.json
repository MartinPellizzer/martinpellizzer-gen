    "intro": "Ranunculus pileomontis, commonly known as the mountain buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant features basal leaves that are palmately lobed, with a distinctive yellow flower that has five petals and numerous stamens. Its flowers bloom in early spring, often before the surrounding vegetation has fully emerged. Ranunculus pileomontis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
