    "intro": "Rubus punctulatus, commonly known as the punctuated blackberry, is a species of bramble native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and thorny stems, typical of many Rubus species. The plant produces small, dark red berries that are edible but often less flavorful compared to other blackberry varieties. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges and a hairy texture. Rubus punctulatus thrives in moist, wooded areas and is often found in the understory of forests."
