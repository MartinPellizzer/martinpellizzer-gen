    "intro": "Ranunculus monspeliacus subsp. aspromontanus, commonly known as the Aspromontan buttercup, is a rare and distinctive member of the Ranunculaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, spurred petals and a hairy, glandular stem, which are typical features of the genus Ranunculus. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in mountainous regions, particularly in southern Europe. Its flowers are usually bright yellow or orange, with five to seven sepals that are often mistaken for petals. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
