    "intro": "Rotala roxburghiana, commonly known as water lettuce, is a floating aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It has broad, waxy, spoon-shaped leaves that are arranged in rosettes on the water's surface. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by small, round fruits. It is often found in slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and marshes. Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in some environments if not managed properly."
