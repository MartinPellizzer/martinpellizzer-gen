    "intro": "Rubus pilosus var. infestus, commonly known as the hairy raspberry or brambles, is a thorny shrub native to parts of North America. It is characterized by its prickly stems and clusters of white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces small, red, edible berries that are often used in jams and pies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and thickets. Its aggressive growth habit can make it a persistent weed in agricultural and natural areas."
