    "intro": "Rubus glomeratus var. griseolus, commonly known as the gray-fruited blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, thorny growth habit and small, dark purple to black berries. The leaves are typically trifoliate, with serrated margins, and the plant produces clusters of white flowers in the spring. The fruits are generally smaller and less sweet compared to other blackberry varieties, but they are valued for their tart flavor and use in jams and preserves. This plant thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
