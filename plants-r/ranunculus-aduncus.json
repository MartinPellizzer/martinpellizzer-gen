It features delicate, palmately divided leaves and bright yellow flowers with five petals. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and stream banks. It blooms from late spring to early summer, and its flowers are attractive to pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The species is characterized by its short stature and is often considered a wildflower of ecological and horticultural interest."
