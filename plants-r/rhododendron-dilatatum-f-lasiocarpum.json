    "intro": "Rhododendron dilatatum f. lasiocarpum, commonly known as the hairy-fruited alpine rhododendron, is a unique botanical variant native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its dense, hairy texture on both its leaves and flower buds, which provides insulation against cold climates. The plant typically grows in high-altitude forests and alpine meadows, where it thrives in well-drained, acidic soils. Its flowers are usually pink to red, blooming in early spring, and the plant is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is relatively rare and often found in specialized botanical collections."
