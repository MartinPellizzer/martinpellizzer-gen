    "intro": "Rhododendron riparium, commonly known as the water rhododendron, is a flowering shrub native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its evergreen foliage and showy, clustered flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows near water sources, such as streams and rivers, which is reflected in its species name \"riparium,\" meaning riverbank. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, providing a striking contrast to the vibrant pink or white blooms. Rhododendron riparium is well adapted to moist, acidic soils and partial shade, making it a popular choice for wetland gardens."
