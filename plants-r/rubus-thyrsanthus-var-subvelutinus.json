    "intro": "Rubus thyrsanthus var. subvelutinus, commonly known as the velvet raspberry, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Argentina and Chile. It is characterized by its biennial growth habit, with the first year producing leaves and the second year bearing flowers and fruits. The plant features compound leaves with serrated margins and produces small, aggregate fruits known as drupes. Its flowers are typically pink or white, and it thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil. The variety is noted for its hairy foliage, which gives it the \"velvet\" appearance in its common name."
