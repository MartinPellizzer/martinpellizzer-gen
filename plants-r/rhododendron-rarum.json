    "intro": "Rhododendron rarum, commonly known as the rare rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range in color from deep purples to vibrant reds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in dense forests. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, providing a striking contrast to its colorful blooms. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Rhododendron rarum is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
