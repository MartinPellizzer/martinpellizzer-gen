    "intro": "Rhysolepis oblongifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leafed rhysolepis, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its elongated, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its growth habit is compact, with multiple stems arising from the base, and it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. Rhysolepis oblongifolia is often found in shaded, humid environments and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
