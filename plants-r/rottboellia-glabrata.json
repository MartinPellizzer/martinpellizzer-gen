    "intro": "Rottboellia glabrata, commonly known as the smooth rottboellia, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically smooth and hairless. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open areas such as roadsides and disturbed sites. Rottboellia glabrata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping due to its low maintenance requirements."
