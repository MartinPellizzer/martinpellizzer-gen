    "intro": "Rumex californicus, commonly known as California sorrel, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically reddish or purple underneath, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early spring. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread easily in moist, shady environments. Botanically, it is valued for its edible leaves, which have a tangy, sour flavor."
