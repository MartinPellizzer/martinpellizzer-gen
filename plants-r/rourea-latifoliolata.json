    "intro": "Rourea latifoliolata, commonly known as the broad-leaved rourea, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate to elliptical leaves that are usually smooth and glossy. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers, which are often followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in humid, lowland areas. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a decorative plant."
