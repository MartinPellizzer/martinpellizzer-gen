    "intro": "Rosa jundzillii var. aliothii, commonly known as the Aliothi rose, is a rare and distinctive species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its semi-evergreen to deciduous growth habit and features fragrant, single or semi-double flowers in shades of pink to red. The plant typically grows in rocky or well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with elliptical to ovate leaflets, and it produces thorny stems typical of many rose species. Due to its limited distribution and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts."
