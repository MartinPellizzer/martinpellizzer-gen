    "intro": "Rhododendron uniflorum var. imperator, commonly known as the Imperator Rhododendron, is a compact evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It features dense, leathery foliage that provides a lush green backdrop for its showy blooms. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, tubular flowers in shades of pink to red, typically appearing in late spring. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to form a neat, compact growth habit with minimal pruning."
