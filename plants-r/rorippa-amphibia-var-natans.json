    "intro": "Rorippa amphibia var. natans, commonly known as the water crowfoot, is a aquatic or semi-aquatic flowering plant that thrives in shallow water environments. It is characterized by its floating or submerged leaves, which are typically divided into small, lobed segments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often in the spring or early summer. It is commonly found in ponds, ditches, and slow-moving streams across temperate regions. This variant is notable for its adaptability to both water and moist soil conditions."
