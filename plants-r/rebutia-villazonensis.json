    "intro": "Rebutia villazonensis, commonly known as the Villaz\u00f3n's prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the Andes Mountains in South America. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and its ability to store water in its thick, fleshy stems. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it thrives in well-drained soil with full sun exposure. Rebutia villazonensis is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental appeal."
