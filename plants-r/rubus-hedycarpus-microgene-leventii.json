    "intro": "Rubus hedycarpus microgene leventii, commonly known as the microgene leventii raspberry, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or yellow when ripe, containing multiple drupelets. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
