    "intro": "Rosa glauca var. rossiana, commonly known as the Rossian bluebush rose, is a compact, shrubby plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features dense, dark green foliage with a bluish-gray underside, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is adapted to harsh, arid environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and full sun."
