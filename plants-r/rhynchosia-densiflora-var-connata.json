It features compound leaves with numerous small, ovate leaflets arranged in an alternate pattern. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a slender pod that splits open to release small, round seeds. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant floral display."
