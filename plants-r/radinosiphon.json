    "intro": "[WRONG START] Radenosiphon, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Boraginaceae. These plants are typically found in coastal areas and are characterized by their distinctive blue or violet flowers. Radinosiphon species are often succulent, with thick, fleshy leaves that help them retain water in saline environments. They produce small, showy flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The genus includes several species, some of which are used in horticulture for their ornamental value."
