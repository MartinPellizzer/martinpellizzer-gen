    "intro": "Ricinocarpos proximus, commonly known as the narrowleaf sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is a low-growing perennial herb with slender, branching stems and small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Its root system is adapted to survive in dry conditions, allowing it to thrive in sandy or rocky soils. The species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small insects and animals."
