    "intro": "Ricinocarpus digynostachyus, commonly known as the two-stemmed ricin tree, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Malvaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its distinctive two-stemmed growth habit. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by capsule fruits containing toxic seeds. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a rough texture. Due to the presence of ricin, a potent toxin, it is considered highly dangerous and not suitable for cultivation or consumption."
