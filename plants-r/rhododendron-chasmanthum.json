    "intro": "Rhododendron chasmanthum, commonly known as the Himalayan rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Asia, particularly in the Himalayas. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist climates. The plant features broad, leathery leaves and produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink and white. It is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its native habitat. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in temperate regions."
