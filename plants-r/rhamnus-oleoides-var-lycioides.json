    "intro": "Rhamnus oleoides var. lycioides, commonly known as the desert buckthorn, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its small, dark green leaves and produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring. The plant is adapted to harsh environments, with deep roots that allow it to survive in low-water conditions. Its fruit is a small, leathery capsule that contains several seeds. This species is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and thrive in degraded landscapes."
