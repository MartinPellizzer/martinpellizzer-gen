    "intro": "Rudgea jasminoides subsp. jasminoides, commonly known as the jasmine-like rudgea, is a flowering plant native to the Andes region of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that resemble those of true jasmine, typically white or pale yellow in color. The plant has opposite, simple leaves that are often hairy and have a somewhat aromatic scent. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is more commonly found in its natural habitat."
