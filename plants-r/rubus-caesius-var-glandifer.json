    "intro": "Rubus caesius var. glandifer, commonly known as the glandular blackberry, is a shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, dark red berries that are typically harvested in the fall. Its flowers are white and clustered in the leaf axils, and the plant is often found in moist, wooded areas. The variety is distinguished by its glandular hairs on the stems and leaves, which give it its scientific name."
