It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant produces a red dye from its roots, which has been historically used in textiles and dyes. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. This variety is valued both for its ornamental qualities and its historical significance in natural dye production."
