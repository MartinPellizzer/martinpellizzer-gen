    "intro": "Ranunculus flammula f. pilosa, commonly known as the hairy buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, bright yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in early spring. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which give it its specific epithet \"pilosa.\" It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The hairy texture of its foliage helps reduce water loss and provides some protection against herbivores."
