    "intro": "Ranunculus apiifolius, commonly known as the cow parsley buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that resemble those ofApium (wild celery), giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in early spring. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. Ranunculus apiifolius is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
