    "intro": "Rosa pouzinii var. histricosa, commonly known as the rough-stemmed rose, is a rare and endangered species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and small, fragrant pink flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has dark green, serrated leaves and produces rose hips that are typically red or orange in color. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to survive."
