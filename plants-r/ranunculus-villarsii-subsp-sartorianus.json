It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in grasslands and woodland margins. The plant features trifoliate leaves with serrated edges and produces showy yellow flowers with five petals. It blooms from late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to habitat loss, this subspecies is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
