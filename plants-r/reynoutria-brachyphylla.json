    "intro": "Reynoutria brachyphylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved Japanese knotweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread rapidly and aggressively. The plant features heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in length. It produces small, pale green to white flowers in clusters during the summer months. Due to its invasive nature, it is often considered a noxious weed in regions outside its native range."
