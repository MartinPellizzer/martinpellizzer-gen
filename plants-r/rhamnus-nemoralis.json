    "intro": "Rhamnus nemoralis, commonly known as the common buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters, featuring dark green, oval-shaped leaves that turn reddish in autumn. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring, followed by black, berry-like fruits that are an important food source for birds. It thrives in a variety of soils but prefers well-drained, slightly acidic conditions. Rhamnus nemoralis is often found in woodland edges, hedgerows, and disturbed sites."
