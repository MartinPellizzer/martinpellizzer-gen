    "intro": "Rafflesia kemumu, commonly known as the \"smelly lady,\" is a parasitic flowering plant native to the rainforests of Indonesia. It is renowned for producing one of the largest individual flowers in the world, with a diameter that can reach up to 1 meter. The plant lacks leaves, stems, and roots, relying entirely on its host plant for nutrients. Its flowers emit a strong, unpleasant odor resembling decaying meat, which attracts flies and other insects for pollination. The botanical significance of Rafflesia kemumu lies in its unique evolutionary adaptations and its role in the ecological balance of its habitat."
