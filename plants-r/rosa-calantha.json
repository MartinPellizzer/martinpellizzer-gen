    "intro": "Rosa calantha, commonly known as the Chinese rose, is a deciduous shrub native to China and the Himalayas. It is characterized by its dense, thornless growth habit and its ability to produce clusters of fragrant, semi-double to fully double flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, with flowers in shades of pink, red, and white. Its leaves are dark green, oval-shaped, and arranged alternately along the stems. Rosa calantha is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens for its showy blooms and compact form."
