It is characterized by its thorny stems and dark purple to black berries that ripen in the fall. The leaves are typically trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the plant thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil. It is a shrub that can grow up to several feet tall, often found in woodland edges and disturbed areas. The berries are edible, though some varieties may have a tart or slightly bitter flavor."
