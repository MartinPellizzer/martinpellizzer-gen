It features dense, dark green foliage that provides a striking contrast to its showy, white or pale pink flowers. The flowers are typically bell-shaped and bloom in late spring to early summer. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its refined appearance. It prefers acidic, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens."
