    "intro": "Rumex \u00d7 arpadianus, commonly known as the hybrid sorrel, is a naturally occurring hybrid between Rumex acetosa (common sorrel) and Rumex acetobulus (broad-leaved sorrel). It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves with a reddish tint and a sour taste due to the presence of oxalic acid. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, waste areas, and along roadsides. It produces small, greenish flowers in clusters during the spring and early summer. The hybrid is notable for its adaptability and has been observed in various parts of Europe."
