    "intro": "Ranunculus tenebrosus, commonly known as the dark ranunculus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features delicate, usually single flowers with five to eight petals that range in color from yellow to deep red. The plant has a basal rosette of finely divided, fern-like leaves and produces slender, hairy stems that bear the showy blooms. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is more commonly appreciated in its natural environment."
