It is characterized by its thorny stems and aggregate fruits, which are typically dark purple to black in color. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by the development of its edible berries. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils. The hybrid nature of this plant contributes to its adaptability and variability in morphology and fruit quality."
