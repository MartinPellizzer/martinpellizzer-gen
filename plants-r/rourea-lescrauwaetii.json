    "intro": "Rourea lescrauwaetii, commonly known as the Lescrau's rourea, is a species of flowering plant in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and produces small, clustered flowers with yellowish-green petals. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and less-studied species."
