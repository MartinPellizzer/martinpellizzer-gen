    "intro": "Ribes viscosissimum, commonly known as sticky currant, is a deciduous shrub native to North America. It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a sticky resin, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or yellow in color, ripening in late summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Ribes viscosissimum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in some traditional herbal remedies."
