    "intro": "Rourea maxima, commonly known as the giant rourea, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, waxy leaves that can grow up to 3 feet in length. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers, which are often fragrant. It thrives in humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its size and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in tropical gardens and greenhouses."
