    "intro": "Rinorea lepidobotrys, commonly known as the silverleaf rinorea, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Violaceae and is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or white. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine, silvery hairs, giving it its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely distributed outside its native range."
