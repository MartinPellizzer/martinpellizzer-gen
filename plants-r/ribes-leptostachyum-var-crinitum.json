    "intro": "Ribes leptostachyum var. crinitum, commonly known as the long-hair currant, is a deciduous shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its slender, arching stems and small, fragrant white flowers that appear in late spring. The plant produces edible, red berries that are similar in taste to regular currants but are often more tart. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered with fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and forested areas."
