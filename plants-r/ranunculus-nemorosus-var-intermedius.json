It typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and along streambanks, thriving in cool, humid environments. The plant features delicate, palmately divided leaves and showy, white or pale yellow flowers with five petals. It is part of the Ranunculaceae family, known for its often toxic sap containing protoanemonin. This variety is distinguished by its intermediate characteristics between the typical R. nemorosus and other related species."
