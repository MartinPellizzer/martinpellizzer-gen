    "intro": "Rhododendron cistiflorum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of bell-shaped, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in cool, moist environments at high elevations, often in shaded forest understories. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, providing a dense canopy that helps retain moisture in its native habitat. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in specialized gardens."
