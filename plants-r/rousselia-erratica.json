    "intro": "Rousselia erratica, commonly known as the purple bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features striking violet-blue flowers that bloom in early summer, typically in clusters at the ends of its slender stems. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface, and its roots are fibrous and often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and herbal practices."
