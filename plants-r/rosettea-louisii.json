    "intro": "Rosettea louisii, commonly known as the Louisiana rosette, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a compact cluster near the ground. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in late spring to early summer, typically in shades of white or pale pink. Rosettea louisii thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
