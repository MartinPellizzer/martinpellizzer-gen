    "intro": "Rosa canina f. brachypetala, commonly known as the short-stemmed dog rose, is a botanical variant of the dog rose species. It is characterized by its shorter stems and smaller, more compact growth habit compared to the typical Rosa canina. The plant produces pink to red flowers that bloom in spring, followed by orange-red hips, which are rich in vitamin C. It is native to Europe and is often found in woodland edges and scrub habitats. This form is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in herbal medicine."
