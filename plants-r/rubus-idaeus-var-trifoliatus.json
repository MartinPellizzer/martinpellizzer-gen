It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets arranged in a fan-like pattern. This plant typically produces small, aggregate fruits that are similar in appearance to regular raspberries. It thrives in temperate climates and prefers well-drained soil. The botanical features of this variety make it a unique subject for horticultural study and garden cultivation."
