    "intro": "Raddiella ramosissima, commonly known as the clustered sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial herb with a sprawling habit, characterized by its dense, branching structure. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically gray-green, covered in a fine layer of silky hairs, which helps reduce water loss in dry environments. Raddiella ramosissima is adapted to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert scrub habitats."
