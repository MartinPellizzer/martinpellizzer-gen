    "intro": "Rubus genevieri var. pseudotruncatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to certain regions of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, thornless stems and small, dark purple to black berries. The leaves are typically narrow and have a serrated edge, distinguishing it from other Rubus species. This plant thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland or scrubland habitats. Its berries are edible but can be quite tart, making them suitable for jams and preserves."
