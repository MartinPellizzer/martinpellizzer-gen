The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red or black berries in the summer. It is native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa, and is often found in hedgerows and woodland edges. Rubus vulgaris is valued for its ecological role, providing food for birds and insects, and has been used in traditional herbal medicine."
