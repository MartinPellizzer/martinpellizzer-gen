    "intro": "Rubus mucronifer var. mucronatoides, commonly known as the narrow-tipped blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to parts of eastern North America. It is characterized by its slender, thornless stems and small, dark purple to black berries that ripen in late summer. The plant typically grows in woodland areas and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces white to pale pink flowers in the spring. This variety is valued for its edible fruits and is often found in shaded, humid environments."
