    "intro": "Rennellia microcephala, commonly known as the Rennell island bellflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the island of Rennell in the Solomon Islands. It is a member of the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or violet in color. The plant grows in rocky, coastal habitats and is adapted to the humid, tropical climate of its native region. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Rennellia microcephala is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and environmental changes."
