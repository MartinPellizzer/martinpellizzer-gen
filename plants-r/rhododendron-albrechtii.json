    "intro": "Rhododendron albrechtii, commonly known as the albrecht's rhododendron, is a flowering shrub native to the mountainous regions of eastern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of bell-shaped, fragrant flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows at high altitudes, thriving in cool, moist climates with well-drained soil. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, providing a striking contrast to its showy blossoms. Rhododendron albrechtii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and botanical gardens."
