    "intro": "Rhododendron venustum, commonly known as the rare velvet rhododendron, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to deep red. The plant thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and requires a cool, moist climate to flourish. Its ornamental value makes it a sought-after species in horticulture, though it is relatively uncommon in cultivation. Due to habitat loss, Rhododendron venustum is considered endangered in its natural range."
