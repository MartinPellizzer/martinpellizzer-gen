    "intro": "Rorippa aspera subsp. praeterita, commonly known as the slender watercress, is a member of the Brassicaceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, succulent leaves. It typically grows in moist or aquatic environments, such as marshes, stream banks, and flooded meadows. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers with four petals, which are arranged in racemes. Its root system is fibrous, allowing it to anchor in wet soils and absorb nutrients efficiently. The species is often found in temperate regions and is adapted to fluctuating water levels."
