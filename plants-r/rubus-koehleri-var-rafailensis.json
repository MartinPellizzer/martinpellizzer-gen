It is characterized by its prickly stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically harvested when fully ripe. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
