    "intro": "Rhadamanthus platyphyllus, commonly known as the broad-leaf rhadamanthus, is a rare and striking member of the Acanthaceae family. It is characterized by its large, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces showy, two-lipped flowers that range in color from purple to pink, typically arranged in spikes. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in many areas."
