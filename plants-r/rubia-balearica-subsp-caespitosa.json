    "intro": "Rubia balearica subsp. caespitosa, commonly known as the Balearic balm, is a perennial herb native to the Balearic Islands. It features slender, upright stems that are often hairy, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
