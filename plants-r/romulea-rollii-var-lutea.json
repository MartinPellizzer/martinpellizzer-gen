    "intro": "Romulea rollii var. lutea, commonly known as the yellow romulea, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, tuberous roots that help it survive in its arid environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by plant enthusiasts."
