    "intro": "Rosa paniculata, commonly known as the panicle rose, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of fragrant, pink or white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces compound leaves with serrated edges and has thorny stems that provide structural support. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Rosa paniculata is also valued for its hardiness and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
