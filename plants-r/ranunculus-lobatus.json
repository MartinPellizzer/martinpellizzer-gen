    "intro": "Ranunculus lobatus, commonly known as the European buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features bright yellow flowers with five to eight sepals that resemble petals, and it typically grows in moist, calcareous soils. The plant has a basal rosette of leaves that are deeply lobed and covered in fine hairs. Its flowers bloom from late spring to early summer, and it is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. Ranunculus lobatus is known for its toxic properties, containing protoanemonin, which can cause skin irritation."
