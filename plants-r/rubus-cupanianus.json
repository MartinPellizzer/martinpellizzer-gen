    "intro": "Rubus cupanianus, commonly known as the cupani's blackberry, is a species of brambles native to South America. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and thorny stems, which help it to climb and spread across the ground. The plant produces aggregate fruits composed of small, dark purple to black drupelets, which are typically harvested when fully ripe. Its leaves are compound, with three to five leaflets, and are covered in fine hairs. Rubus cupanianus is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and along riverbanks."
