It is a member of the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its pinnately compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant thrives in brackish water environments, often growing in mangrove swamps and tidal zones. Its roots form dense networks that help stabilize coastal soils and prevent erosion. The plant also plays a role in supporting local biodiversity by providing habitat and food for various marine and terrestrial species."
