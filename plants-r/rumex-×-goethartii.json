    "intro": "Rumex \u00d7 goethartii, commonly known as the hybrid sorrel, is a naturally occurring hybrid between Rumex acetosa (common sorrel) and Rumex acetobipenis (broadleaf sorrel). It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are typically reddish in color. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are borne on slender, erect stems. It thrives in moist, fertile soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits a range of morphological variations depending on the parent species involved."
