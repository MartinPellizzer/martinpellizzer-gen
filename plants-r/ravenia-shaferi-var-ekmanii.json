It is characterized by its striking, elongated leaves that are often a deep green with a silvery underside. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically in shades of white and pink, during the warmer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a valuable species for botanical study and conservation efforts."
