    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 ampelopsis, commonly known as the bramble-vine or trailing raspberry, is a hybrid plant that combines characteristics of raspberries (Rubus) and ampelopsis vines. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows in moist, shady environments, often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are similar to raspberries, with a sweet-tart flavor. Its stems are thorny and can trail along the ground or climb using tendrils. The leaves are compound, usually with three to five leaflets, and are often serrated along the edges."
