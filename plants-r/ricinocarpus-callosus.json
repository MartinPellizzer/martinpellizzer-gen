    "intro": "Ricinocarpus callosus, commonly known as the rough-leafed ricin tree, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a large evergreen tree that can grow up to 20 meters tall, characterized by its thick, rough-textured bark and broad, leathery leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous green flowers followed by woody, spiny fruits containing toxic seeds. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine, although the plant contains potent toxins that require careful handling."
