It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, red berries. The plant typically grows in moist, wooded areas and thrives in temperate climates. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and its flowers are white with five petals. The berries are edible, though they are often used in jams and pies due to their tart flavor."
