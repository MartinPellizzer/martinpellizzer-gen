    "intro": "Rosa glauca var. rigida, commonly known as the rigid blue rose, is a compact shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and small, dark green leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white, waxy hair. The plant produces clusters of pale blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It is a hardy species that thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Due to its ornamental value and cold hardiness, it is a prized addition to botanical collections and gardens."
