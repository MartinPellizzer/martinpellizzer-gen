    "intro": "Rubus insignis, commonly known as the alpine blackberry, is a species of brambles native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its erect growth habit and prickly stems, which are typical of the Rubus genus. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are often used in traditional herbal remedies. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it thrives in cool, moist environments. The botanical features of Rubus insignis make it well adapted to high-altitude habitats where it plays a role in local ecosystems."
