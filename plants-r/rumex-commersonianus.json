    "intro": "Rumex commersonianus, commonly known as narrowleaf dock, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, serrated leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers in spring, which are borne on erect, branched stems. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively and colonize disturbed soils. Rumex commersonianus is often found in moist environments such as meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges."
