    "intro": "Rhododendron longesquamatum, commonly known as the long scale rhododendron, is a species native to the Himalayas, particularly in regions of India and Nepal. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and showy, funnel-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The leaves are leathery and dark green, often with a waxy coating, while the flowers range in color from white to pink and are typically borne in clusters. This plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous forests at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and ornamental species within the Rhododendron genus."
