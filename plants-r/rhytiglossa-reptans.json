    "intro": "Rhytiglossa reptans, commonly known as the creeping lily or rock lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America. It features a low-growing, rhizomatous stem system that allows it to spread across rocky and well-drained soils. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple, with a distinctive hooded structure. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Rhytiglossa reptans is well adapted to harsh alpine environments and is often found in open, sunny habitats."
