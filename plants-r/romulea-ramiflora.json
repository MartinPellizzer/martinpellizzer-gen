It features striking, tubular orange-red flowers that resemble flames, blooming in late summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in a dense cluster. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a desirable addition to Mediterranean and arid climate gardens."
