    "intro": "Ricinus americanus, commonly known as the castor oil plant, is a flowering plant native to the eastern and central United States. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves and distinctive spiny seed capsules. The plant produces toxic seeds that contain ricin, a potent toxin, making it hazardous if ingested. It thrives in warm, sunny environments and is often cultivated for its oil-rich seeds. The castor oil plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
