    "intro": "Rhaptopetalum sessilifolium, commonly known as the sessile-leaf rockrose, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a shrub that typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, thriving in full sun. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, which bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are sessile, meaning they are attached directly to the stem without stalks, giving it a distinctive appearance. It is often used in rock gardens due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
