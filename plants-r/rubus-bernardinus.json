    "intro": "Rubus bernardinus, commonly known as the desert raspberry, is a species of bramble native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in desert or semi-desert environments. The plant produces small, edible fruits that are similar to raspberries but have a more tart flavor. Its leaves are compound, with three to five leaflets, and it has thorny stems typical of the Rubus genus. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry conditions, making it an important part of its native ecosystem."
