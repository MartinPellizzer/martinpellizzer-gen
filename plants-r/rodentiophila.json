    "intro": "Rodentiophila, commonly known as the mouse-ear plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its small, delicate leaves that resemble the ears of mice, hence its common name. The flowers are typically small and clustered in umbels, a feature typical of the carrot family. Rodentiophila species are often found in rocky or sandy soils, thriving in arid or semi-arid environments. These plants are generally herbaceous, with some species growing as annuals or perennials depending on the species and climate."
