    "intro": "Rotheca incisa, commonly known as the narrowleaf rotheca, is a flowering plant native to parts of North America. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands or along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and often have a serrated edge, and it produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. Rotheca incisa is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local pollinators."
