    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus subsp. prasinus, commonly known as the greenleaf buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features delicate, palmate leaves that are typically a vibrant green, distinguishing it from other members of the Ranunculaceae family. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with five to seven petals, often with a distinctive yellow center. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens but requires careful management to prevent it from becoming invasive."
