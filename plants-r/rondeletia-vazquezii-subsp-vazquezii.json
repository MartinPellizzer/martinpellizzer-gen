    "intro": "Rondeletia vazquezii subsp. vazquezii, commonly known as the Vazquez's rondeletia, is a flowering plant native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from red to orange, often with a contrasting throat. The plant typically grows as an erect shrub, reaching heights of up to 2 meters, and produces elliptical, leathery leaves. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to the tropical climate of its native habitat. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
