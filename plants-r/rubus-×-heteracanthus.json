It is characterized by its thorny stems and aggregate fruits, which are typically dark purple to black in color. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by the development of its edible berries. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in hedgerows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils. Its botanical features make it both a valuable food source for wildlife and a common weed in agricultural settings."
