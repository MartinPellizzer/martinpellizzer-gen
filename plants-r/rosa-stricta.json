The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters and has dark green, oval-shaped leaves with serrated edges. Its flowers are often used in perfumery and traditional medicine due to their aromatic properties. Rosa stricta is well adapted to harsh climates and can thrive in rocky or well-drained soils."
