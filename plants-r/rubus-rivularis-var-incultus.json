    "intro": "Rubus rivularis var. incultus, commonly known as the river raspberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the temperate regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows along riverbanks and moist woodland edges, thriving in well-drained to moderately moist soils. The plant features compound leaves with serrated edges and produces small, aggregate berries that ripen to a deep red color. It is characterized by its thorny stems and is often found in riparian habitats. This variety is less commonly cultivated than other Rubus species but is valued for its ornamental and ecological benefits."
