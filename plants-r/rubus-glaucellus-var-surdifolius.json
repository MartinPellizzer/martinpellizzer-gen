    "intro": "Rubus glaucellus var. surdifolius, commonly known as the alpine raspberry, is a variant of the raspberry plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit and thorny stems, typical of the Rubus genus. The leaves are elliptical with a distinctive glaucous (bluish-gray) underside, giving it its scientific name. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, and the fruit is a small, aggregate berry. This plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes."
