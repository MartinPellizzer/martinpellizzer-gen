    "intro": "Ranunculus calliodon, commonly known as the narrowleaf buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the western United States. It features delicate, yellow flowers with five petals and is typically found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks. The plant has trifoliate leaves that are finely divided, giving it a distinctive, lace-like appearance. It blooms from late spring to early summer and is often found in association with other wildflowers in its native range. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
