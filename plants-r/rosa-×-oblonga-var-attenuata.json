    "intro": "Rosa \u00d7 oblonga var. attenuata, commonly known as the slender evergreen rose, is a hybrid shrub native to China. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and dark green, leathery leaves that remain on the plant throughout the winter. The plant produces fragrant, semi-double pink flowers in late spring to early summer. It is well adapted to coastal climates and is often used in hedges or as a foundation plant. Its evergreen nature makes it a valuable addition to gardens seeking year-round structure and color."
