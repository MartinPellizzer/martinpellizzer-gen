    "intro": "Rosa scabriuscula, commonly known as the roughleaf rose, is a species of flowering shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its grayish-brown, rough-textured stems and oval, serrated leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant pink flowers in the spring, which are followed by red-orange hips in the fall. Rosa scabriuscula is typically found in woodlands and along stream banks, where it thrives in partial to full sun. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
