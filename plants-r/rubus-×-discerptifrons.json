    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 discerptifrons, commonly known as the blackberry raspberry hybrid, is a deciduous shrub belonging to the Rosaceae family. It is a naturally occurring hybrid between Rubus ursinus (blackberry) and Rubus chamaemorus (cloudberry), resulting in a plant with unique botanical characteristics. The species is notable for its compound leaves, typically with three to five leaflets, and its aggregate fruits, which develop from multiple ovaria. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in moist, shaded environments. Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits a wide range of morphological variability in its wild populations."
