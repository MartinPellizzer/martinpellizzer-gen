It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that ripen to a dark purple or black color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or disturbed areas. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in certain regions."
