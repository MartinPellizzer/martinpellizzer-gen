    "intro": "Ricinus communis var. viridis, commonly known as the green castor oil plant, is a variant of the castor oil plant characterized by its predominantly green foliage. It is a flowering plant in the spurge family, Euphorbiaceae, and is native to tropical and subtropical regions. The leaves are large, palmately lobed, and often have a velvety texture. It produces small, greenish flowers that are typically clustered in cyathia, which are specialized inflorescences. This variety is cultivated for ornamental purposes and has similar medicinal and industrial uses to the common castor oil plant."
