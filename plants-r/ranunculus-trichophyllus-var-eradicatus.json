    "intro": "Ranunculus trichophyllus var. eradicatus, commonly known as the creeping buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features a low-growing, spreading habit with basal leaves that are typically divided into lobes. The plant produces showy yellow flowers with five petals, often accompanied by numerous stamens. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, ditches, and along roadsides. Due to its invasive tendencies, it can become a weed in agricultural and natural habitats."
