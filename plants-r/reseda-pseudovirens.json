    "intro": "Reseda pseudovirens, commonly known as the narrowleaf reseda, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, four-petaled flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. It produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are narrow and linear, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in arid environments."
