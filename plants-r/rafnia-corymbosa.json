    "intro": "Rafnia corymbosa, commonly known as the sweetgum tree, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and its distinctive, star-shaped leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and purple in the fall. The tree produces small, round, spiky fruits called gumballs, which are a common sight in late summer and early autumn. Its bark is smooth and light gray, becoming fissured with age, and it often has a broad, spreading crown. Rafnia corymbosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly planted in urban landscapes for its aesthetic and ecological benefits."
