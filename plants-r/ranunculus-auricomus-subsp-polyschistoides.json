    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus subsp. polyschistoides, commonly known as the alpine buttercup, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its bright yellow, cup-shaped flowers and basal leaves with lobed margins. The subspecies is distinguished by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and its ability to thrive in alpine environments. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun exposure, often growing in meadows and rocky slopes. This plant is typically short-lived, with a life cycle that includes a period of dormancy during colder months."
