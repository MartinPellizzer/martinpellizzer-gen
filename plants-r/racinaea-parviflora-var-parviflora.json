    "intro": "Racinaea parviflora var. parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered racinaea, is a tropical flowering plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It belongs to the Araceae family, characterized by its unique inflorescence consisting of a spadix surrounded by a spathe. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are broad, glossy, and often have a waxy texture, while its small, white flowers bloom in clusters. Due to its ornamental value and rarity, it is often cultivated in greenhouses and botanical gardens."
