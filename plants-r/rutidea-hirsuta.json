    "intro": "Rutidea hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy rutidion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Its hairy stems and leaves are adaptations that help reduce water loss in humid conditions. Rutidea hirsuta is also known for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which contributes to soil fertility."
