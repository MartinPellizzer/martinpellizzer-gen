    "intro": "Rhinanthus ovifugus, commonly known as the yellow rattle, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, known for its parasitic relationship with grasses. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and it often grows in disturbed soils in meadows and grasslands. Rhinanthus ovifugus plays a role in promoting biodiversity by reducing grass dominance in habitats."
