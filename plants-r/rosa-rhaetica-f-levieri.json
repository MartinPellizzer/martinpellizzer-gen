    "intro": "Rosa rhaetica f. levieri, commonly known as the Rhaetian rose, is a rare and striking cultivar of the Rosa rhaetica species. It is characterized by its deep red, semi-double flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is native to the alpine regions of the European Alps, where it thrives in cool, moist, and well-drained soils. Its foliage consists of dark green, serrated leaves that provide a lush backdrop to its vibrant blossoms. Due to its limited natural range and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in specialized gardens and botanical collections."
