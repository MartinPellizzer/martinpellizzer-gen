    "intro": "Rubus horriduliformis, commonly known as the roughleaf blackberry, is a species of brambles native to parts of North America. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black in color when mature. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and thickets. Due to its hardy nature, it plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing food for wildlife and stabilizing soil."
