    "intro": "Ranunculus polypetalus, commonly known as the Indian buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the Himalayas. It features showy, yellow flowers with five to eight petal-like sepals that give it a cup-like appearance. The plant has a stout, hairy stem that branches near the base, supporting clusters of small, yellow flowers. Its leaves are deeply lobed and covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Ranunculus polypetalus is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant blooms."
