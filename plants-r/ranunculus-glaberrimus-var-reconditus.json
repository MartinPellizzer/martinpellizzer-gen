    "intro": "Ranunculus glaberrimus var. reconditus, commonly known as the alpine buttercup, is a flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its delicate, yellow flowers with five petals and a hairy stem that becomes glabrous as it matures. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine meadows, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are palmately divided, and the plant is often found in association with other alpine flora. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
