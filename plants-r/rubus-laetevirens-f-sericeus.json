    "intro": "Rubus laetevirens f. sericeus, commonly known as the silky blackberry, is a botanical variant of the blackberry plant characterized by its distinctive silvery-white pubescence on the stems and leaves. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is native to regions of Europe and parts of Asia. The leaves are typically trifoliate, with serrated margins, and the plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are usually dark purple to black in color. This form is often cultivated for its ornamental value and its unique, silky texture, which sets it apart from other Rubus species. It thrives in temperate climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
