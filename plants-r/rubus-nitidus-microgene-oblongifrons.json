    "intro": "Rubus nitidus microgene oblongifrons, commonly known as the narrow-leaf blackberry, is a species of brambles native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its slender, thorny stems and trifoliate leaves that are typically narrow and oblong in shape. The plant produces small, black berries that are edible and often used in jams and pies. It thrives in woodland edges and moist soils, and it plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing food for wildlife. Its botanical features make it distinct from other Rubus species, particularly in its leaf morphology and fruit size."
