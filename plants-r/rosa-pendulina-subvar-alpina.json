It is characterized by its long, arching stems that can reach several meters in length, often trailing over rocky surfaces or through shrubs. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are compound, consisting of multiple oval-shaped leaflets, and it thrives in well-drained, acidic soils. This variety is well adapted to cold climates and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats."
