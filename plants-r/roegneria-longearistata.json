    "intro": "Roegneria longearistata, commonly known as the slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny florets, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Roegneria longearistata is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
