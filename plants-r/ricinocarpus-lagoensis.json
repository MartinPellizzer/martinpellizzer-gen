    "intro": "Ricinocarpus lagoensis, commonly known as the swamp sheathgrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and seasonally flooded areas, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant has long, narrow leaves that form dense clumps, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often overlooked. Its reproductive strategy involves wind pollination, which is common among grass-like plants. The botanical features of Ricinocarpus lagoensis make it well-adapted to its aquatic or semi-aquatic habitat."
