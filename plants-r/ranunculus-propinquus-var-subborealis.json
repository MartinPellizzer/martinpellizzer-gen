    "intro": "Ranunculus propinquus var. subborealis, commonly known as the northern crowfoot, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to northern regions of North America. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as wetlands, stream banks, and forested areas. The plant features delicate, palmately divided leaves and small, yellow flowers with five petals. It is characterized by its short stature and is often found in wet or seasonally flooded habitats. This variety is closely related to other ranunculus species and plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and nectar for pollinators."
