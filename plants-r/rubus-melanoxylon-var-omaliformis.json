    "intro": "Rubus melanoxylon var. omaliformis, commonly known as the blackberry bramble, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, thorny growth habit and dark purple to black berries that ripen in late summer. The plant produces compound leaves with serrated edges and small, white flowers in the spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Its berries are edible but have a tart flavor, making them suitable for jams and pies."
