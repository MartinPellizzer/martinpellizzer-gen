    "intro": "Rubus senchalensis, commonly known as the Senchal blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the eastern Himalayas. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically harvested in late summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
