    "intro": "Rapanea emarginata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved holly, is a shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Lauraceae, which includes other aromatic plants like laurel and cinnamon. The plant is characterized by its narrow, elliptical leaves that are often glossy and have a slight waxy coating. Its small, white flowers are typically clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, dark berries that are edible but not widely consumed by humans. Rapanea emarginata is often found in moist, shaded forest environments and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role."
