    "intro": "Rhynchosia baumii, commonly known as the African violet bean, is a climbing legume native to tropical Africa. It features trifoliate leaves with heart-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellow flowers that are followed by elongated pods. The plant belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its nitrogen-fixing ability through symbiotic bacteria in its root nodules. Rhynchosia baumii is often cultivated for its ornamental value, although it is also used in traditional medicine. Its growth habit and botanical features make it an interesting subject for both horticultural and ecological studies."
