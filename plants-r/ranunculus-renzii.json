    "intro": "Ranunculus renzii, commonly known as the Chinese buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to eastern Asia. It features showy, yellow flowers with five to nine petals, often surrounded by a ring of white or green sepals. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments such as forests and stream banks. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three deeply lobed leaflets, and it has a hairy stem that distinguishes it from similar species. Ranunculus renzii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine in some regions."
