    "intro": "Ranunculus hohenackeri, commonly known as the Hohenacker's buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features showy, bright yellow flowers with five to eight petals, typical of the Ranunculaceae family. The plant has finely divided, trifoliate leaves that are hairy and covered in a waxy coating. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
