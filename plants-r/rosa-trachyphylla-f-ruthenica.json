    "intro": "Rosa trachyphylla f. ruthenica, commonly known as the Ruthenian rose, is a botanical variant of the rough rose, characterized by its dense, thorny stems and dark green, oval-shaped leaves. It produces clusters of small, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in areas of Kazakhstan and the Tien Shan mountains. Its hirsute (hairy) foliage and robust growth make it well adapted to harsh, arid environments. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in colder climates."
