    "intro": "Rangaeris, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves, relying instead on its roots for photosynthesis. The plant produces delicate, white or pale pink flowers that bloom briefly during the wet season. Rangaeris thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks. Due to its fragility and habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
