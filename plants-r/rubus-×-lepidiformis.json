    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 lepidiformis, commonly known as the evergreen blackberry, is a hybrid shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and dark green, leathery leaves that remain on the plant year-round. The plant produces small, dark purple berries that are typically eaten by wildlife rather than humans. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in coastal forests. Its botanical features make it an important component of its native ecosystem."
