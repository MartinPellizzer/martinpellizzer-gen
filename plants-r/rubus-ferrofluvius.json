    "intro": "Rubus ferrofluvius, commonly known as the iron river raspberry, is a species of bramble native to the wetlands and riverbanks of southeastern Europe. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and clusters of small, red-orange fruits that ripen in late summer. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found near water bodies, where it plays a role in stabilizing riverbanks. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and its flowers are white with five petals. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to support local wildlife."
