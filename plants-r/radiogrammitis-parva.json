It is characterized by its finely divided, lanceolate leaves that are typically less than 2 centimeters in length. This species thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on the bark of trees or on rocky surfaces in tropical and subtropical regions. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in its preferred habitat. Radiogrammitis parva is notable for its intricate and delicate structure, making it a subject of interest for botanists and enthusiasts of epiphytic plants."
