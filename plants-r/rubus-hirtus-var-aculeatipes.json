    "intro": "Rubus hirtus var. aculeatipes, commonly known as the prickly blackberry, is a species of bramble native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its thorny stems and dark purple to black berries that ripen in the summer. The plant produces compound leaves with serrated edges and small, white flowers that bloom in the spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and thickets. The berries are edible when fully ripe but can be quite tart and are sometimes used in jams and preserves."
