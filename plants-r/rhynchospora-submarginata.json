    "intro": "Rhynchospora submarginata, commonly known as the narrow-margin sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy habitats in North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Rhynchospora submarginata plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and birds. Its presence is often an indicator of healthy, undisturbed wetland ecosystems."
