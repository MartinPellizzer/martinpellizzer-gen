    "intro": "Rubus saulii, commonly known as the Saul's blackberry, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in countries like Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. The plant is characterized by its thorny stems, trifoliate leaves, and small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black in color. It thrives in rocky and arid environments, often growing at high altitudes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Rubus saulii is considered a rare and endangered species."
