It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue or violet flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or grassy habitats at elevations above 2,000 meters. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that bloom during the cooler months.
