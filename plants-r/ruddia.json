It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its compact growth habit and vibrant, showy flowers. The leaves are typically velvety and heart-shaped, often displaying a rich green color with a waxy texture. Ruddia species are popular ornamental plants due to their ability to thrive in indoor environments and their long blooming period. They prefer bright, indirect light and well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
