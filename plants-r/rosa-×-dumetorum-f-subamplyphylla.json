    "intro": "Rosa \u00d7 dumetorum f. subamplyphylla, commonly known as the shrub rose or alpine rose, is a botanical hybrid native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dark green, leathery leaves with a slightly serrated margin. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink to red, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to form dense, bushy growth that is both hardy and long-lived."
