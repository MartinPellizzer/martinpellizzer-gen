It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and turn bright red in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into red, fuzzy berries. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in open woodlands and disturbed areas. Smooth sumac has been used historically for its medicinal properties and as a source of dye."
