    "intro": "Restio lateriflorus, commonly known as the side-flowered restio, is a member of the Restionaceae family, native to South Africa. It is a perennial, evergreen plant characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance and dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in coastal and sandy environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. Its flowers, which appear in late summer to autumn, are clustered on one side of the stem, giving it its common name. Restio lateriflorus is often used in ornamental gardening for its delicate, architectural form and drought tolerance."
