    "intro": "Rhododendron pankimense, commonly known as the Pankim rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to white. The plant typically grows in acidic, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist climates. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, providing a striking contrast to its vibrant floral displays. Rhododendron pankimense is often found in forested areas at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters."
