    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 imperfectus, commonly known as the blackberry raspberry, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between blackberry (Rubus fruticosus) and raspberry (Rubus idaeus). It exhibits characteristics of both parent species, featuring thorny stems and compound leaves typical of the Rubus genus. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or black in color, depending on the variety. It thrives in temperate climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Due to its hybrid nature, it is often cultivated for its flavorful berries and ornamental value."
