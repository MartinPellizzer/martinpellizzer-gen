    "intro": "Rosa micrantha var. pseudoelliptica, commonly known as the narrow-leaf rock rose, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern China. It features slender, upright stems with grayish-brown bark and small, elliptic to ovate leaves that are typically less than 2 inches in length. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers in late spring to early summer, which are followed by red-orange hip fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its compact growth habit and ornamental value make it a desirable addition to botanical collections."
