    "intro": "Rhus villosa var. gracilis, commonly known as smooth sumac, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It features compound leaves with 15 to 31 pairs of oval, serrated leaflets that are typically lighter green on the underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring, which develop into clusters of red, fuzzy berries in the fall. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is adaptable to a variety of soil types. Smooth sumac is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
