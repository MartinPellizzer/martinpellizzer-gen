It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is native to regions of North America, particularly the eastern United States. The plant produces dark purple to black berries that are typically larger and more robust than those of the standard Rubus praedatus. Its foliage features broad, lobed leaves with coarse teeth, contributing to its unique appearance. This subspecies is valued for both its ornamental qualities and its edible fruits."
