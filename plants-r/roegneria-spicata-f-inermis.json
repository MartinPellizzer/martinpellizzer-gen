    "intro": "Roegneria spicata f. inermis, commonly known as the slender false brome, is a perennial grass species characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescences. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands, preferring well-drained soils. The plant is distinguished by its reduced leaf blades and the absence of the awns typically found in other members of the genus. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, producing small, greenish to brownish florets. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and ability to stabilize soil."
