    "intro": "Rosa canina var. lapidicola, commonly known as the stone rose or rock rose, is a variant of the dog rose native to rocky and alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, fragrant pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The leaves are pinnately compound, with serrated leaflets that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. Its fruits, known as hips, are orange-red, hairy, and contain a high concentration of vitamin C. This plant is adapted to harsh environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun."
