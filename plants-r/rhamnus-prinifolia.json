    "intro": "Rhamnus prinifolia, commonly known as the common buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of western Asia. It typically grows to a height of 2\u20136 meters, featuring a straight trunk and a dense, rounded crown. The plant has dark green, oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn, and it produces small, black berries that are an important food source for birds. Rhamnus prinifolia thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, loamy soils and full sun to partial shade. It is often found in woodland edges, hedgerows, and disturbed areas."
