    "intro": "Ranunculus inamoenus, commonly known as the slender buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a basal rosette of finely divided, glossy green leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with five petals, typically appearing in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
