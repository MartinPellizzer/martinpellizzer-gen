    "intro": "Rapinia, commonly known as the yellow gentian, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Gentianaceae. These plants are native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, particularly in Europe and Asia. Rapinia species are typically perennial herbs with showy, blue to violet flowers that bloom in summer. They often grow in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The genus is characterized by its opposite leaves and tubular corollas, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
