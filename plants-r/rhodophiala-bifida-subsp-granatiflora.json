    "intro": "Rhodophiala bifida subsp. granatiflora, commonly known as the granate-flowered rhodophiala, is a striking member of the Amaryllidaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of South America, particularly in Ecuador and Peru. The plant is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of showy, red or pink flowers that resemble grapes, hence its common name. Its foliage consists of strap-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. This species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and is often cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and partial shade."
