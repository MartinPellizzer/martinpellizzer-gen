    "intro": "Ranunculus rivularis var. nanus, commonly known as the dwarf water buttercup, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, often found in marshes, stream sides, and wet meadows. The plant features delicate, yellow flowers with five petals, and its leaves are palmately divided, giving it a feathery appearance. It is an herbaceous perennial that thrives in cool, moist environments. Due to its small size and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in water gardens or as a bog plant."
