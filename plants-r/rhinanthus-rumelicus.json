    "intro": "Rhinanthus rumelicus, commonly known as the yellow rattle, is a flowering plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on other plants for nutrients through its root system. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers that bloom from June to August, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in grasslands and meadows, often found in areas with well-drained soils. Its ecological role is significant in promoting biodiversity by reducing the dominance of dominant grass species."
