    "intro": "Ranunculus carpetanus, commonly known as the carpet buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features a basal rosette of finely divided, serrated leaves and produces clusters of yellow flowers with five petals. Its flowers are usually short-lived, blooming in spring and early summer. The plant is noted for its ability to spread through rhizomes, forming dense mats that can dominate ground cover in suitable habitats."
