    "intro": "Rosa dumalis var. pseudosphaeroidea, commonly known as the alpine rose, is a flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas and Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with narrow, deciduous leaves and clusters of fragrant, pink to white flowers. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its stems are typically covered in dense, glandular hairs, which help protect it from harsh environmental conditions. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable climate conditions."
