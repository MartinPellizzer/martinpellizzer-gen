    "intro": "Rosa carissima, commonly known as the sweetbriar rose, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of fragrant, pink to white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, red, velvety fruits called hips, which are rich in vitamin C. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with oval, serrated leaflets, and it thrives in well-drained soil. Rosa carissima is often cultivated for its ornamental value and historical use in hedgerows and gardens."
