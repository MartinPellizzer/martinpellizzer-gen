    "intro": "Rhinacanthus subcaudatus, commonly known as the red sanders, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish bark and small, elliptical leaves. The plant produces fragrant, white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by woody, spindle-shaped fruits containing flat, winged seeds. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its ornamental value and slow growth, it is a sought-after species in horticulture."
