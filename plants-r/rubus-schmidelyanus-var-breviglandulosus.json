    "intro": "Rubus schmidelyanus var. breviglandulosus, commonly known as the short-glandular blackberry, is a species of brambles native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its thorny stems and aggregate fruits that ripen to a dark purple or black color. The leaves are trifoliate, with serrated margins and hairy surfaces. This variety is distinguished by its short, dense glands on the stems and leaves, which are less pronounced than in other Rubus species. It thrives in moist, woodland habitats and is often found in the understory of deciduous forests."
