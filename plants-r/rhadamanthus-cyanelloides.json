    "intro": "Rhadamanthus cyanelloides, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its pale green, leaf-like structures that resemble leaves but are actually modified stems, and its elongated, pendant flowers that bloom in shades of white and purple. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption, as it lacks true roots. Its unique appearance and ecological requirements make it a subject of both botanical interest and conservation concern. Due to habitat loss and illegal collection, it is listed as endangered in several regions."
