It is characterized by its thorny stems and dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, usually red or black berries that are edible but often have a tart flavor. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it thrives in moist, acidic soils. This subspecies is often found in hedgerows, woodland edges, and disturbed ground."
