    "intro": "Rubus stenophyllus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf blackberry, is a species of bramble native to parts of North America. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves that are typically narrow and elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are usually dark purple to black in color when mature. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, loamy soils. Rubus stenophyllus is often found in woodland edges, thickets, and disturbed areas where it can spread vigorously through its extensive root system."
