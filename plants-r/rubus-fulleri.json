    "intro": "Rubus fulleri, commonly known as the Pacific blackberry, is a species of bramble native to western North America. It is characterized by its thorny stems and aggregate fruits that typically turn from green to red before ripening to a dark purple or black. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by the development of its edible berries. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers moist, well-drained conditions. Rubus fulleri is often found in woodland edges, stream banks, and disturbed areas."
