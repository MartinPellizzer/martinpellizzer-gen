    "intro": "Rosa sempervirens var. glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular evergreen rose, is a compact, shrub-like plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage with glandular dots on the leaves, which give it its scientific name. The plant produces fragrant, semi-double pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is evergreen, retaining its leaves throughout the year, making it a valuable ornamental plant in gardens. Due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal, it is often used in landscaping and as a hedge plant."
