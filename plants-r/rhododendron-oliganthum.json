    "intro": "Rhododendron oliganthum, commonly known as the slender-leaved rhododendron, is a species native to the Himalayas, particularly in regions of India and Nepal. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense foliage, with leaves that are typically narrow and leathery. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or red in color, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in horticultural settings."
