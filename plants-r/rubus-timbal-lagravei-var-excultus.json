    "intro": "Rubus timbal-lagravei var. excultus, commonly known as the Timbal-Lagrave's raspberry variant, is a rare shrub native to specific regions in Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red when mature, similar to other raspberry species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a botanically significant but understudied species."
