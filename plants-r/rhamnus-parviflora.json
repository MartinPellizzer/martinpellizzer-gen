    "intro": "Rhamnus parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in chaparral and woodland habitats. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in the spring, followed by dark, shiny berries that are an important food source for birds and wildlife. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a leathery texture with a distinctive, often aromatic scent. Rhamnus parviflora is characterized by its upright growth habit and ability to thrive in harsh, arid environments."
