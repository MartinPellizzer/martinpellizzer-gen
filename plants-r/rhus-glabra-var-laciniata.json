    "intro": "Rhus glabra var. laciniata, commonly known as smooth sumac, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It features compound leaves with serrated margins, which give it a distinctive, feathery appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in upright clusters, followed by red, fuzzy fruits that are a characteristic feature. Its leaves are typically alternate and have a smooth texture, contrasting with the more rugged leaves of the typical Rhus glabra. This variety is often found in open woodlands and disturbed sites, contributing to the ecological diversity of its habitat."
