    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus subsp. retusiformis, commonly known as the hairy leaf buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers with five broadly ovate petals and a hairy stem. The subspecies is distinguished by its retuse (notched) leaf base, which sets it apart from other members of the species. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and stream banks. The plant is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
