    "intro": "Rheum pumilum, commonly known as the dwarf rhubarb, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features thick, fleshy rhizomes and erect, hairy stems that bear alternate, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are edible, though they contain oxalic acid and should be cooked before consumption. Rheum pumilum is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
