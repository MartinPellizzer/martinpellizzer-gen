    "intro": "Ribes grossularia var. sylvestre, commonly known as wild gooseberry, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features compound leaves with five to seven elliptical leaflets that are serrated along the edges. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are followed by edible, red berries that are tart and often used in jams and wines. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. This variety is valued for its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine."
