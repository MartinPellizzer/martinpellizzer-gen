    "intro": "Rupifraga cuscutiformis, commonly known as the rock dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a vine-like structure that allows it to attach to various host plants. The plant is typically found in rocky or arid environments, where it can thrive by tapping into the vascular systems of its hosts. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, enabling it to colonize new areas. Due to its parasitic nature, it can sometimes cause significant damage to its host plants."
