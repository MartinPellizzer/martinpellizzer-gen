    "intro": "Rhipsalis heptagona, commonly known as the seven-sided cactus, is a species of epiphytic cactus native to Brazil. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom during the rainy season, typically from November to March. Its stems are segmented and can grow up to several meters in length, making it well adapted for climbing. Rhipsalis heptagona is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its attractive appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
