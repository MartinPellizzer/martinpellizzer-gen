    "intro": "Rhamnus ilicifolia, commonly known as the coastal buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to the western coast of North America. It typically grows in coastal scrub and chaparral habitats, thriving in sandy or rocky soils. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually glossy and dark green. Its flowers are small and yellowish-green, appearing in clusters, and it produces small, red berries that are edible for some wildlife. Rhamnus ilicifolia is well adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds."
