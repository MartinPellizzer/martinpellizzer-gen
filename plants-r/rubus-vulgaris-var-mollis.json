    "intro": "Rubus vulgaris var. mollis, commonly known as the soft-fruited bramble, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves, which are typically serrated and have a hairy texture. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits known as drupes, which are usually red or black when mature. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in hedgerows, woodlands, and disturbed soils. This variant is distinguished by its softer, more tender fruit compared to other Rubus species."
