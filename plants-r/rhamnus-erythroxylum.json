It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often reddish or yellowish in color. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible berries that are rich in caffeine and other compounds. It thrives in temperate to subtropical climates and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its caffeine content, it has been historically used for making beverages similar to coffee."
