    "intro": "Rubus arduennensis var. laceratus, commonly known as the rough bramble, is a variant of the bramble genus Rubus found primarily in specific regions of Europe. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges, which contribute to its rugged appearance. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits known as drupes, typically red or black in color, which are an important food source for various wildlife. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and hedgerows. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
