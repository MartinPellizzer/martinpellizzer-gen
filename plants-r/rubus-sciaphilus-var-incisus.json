    "intro": "Rubus sciaphilus var. incisus, commonly known as the shadow raspberry, is a shrub characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in woodland areas or under dense canopy cover. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or black in color, similar to other raspberries in the Rubus genus. Its flowers are white or pale pink, with five petals and numerous stamens, typical of the Rosaceae family. This variant is notable for its ability to adapt to low-light conditions, making it a unique species in understory ecosystems."
