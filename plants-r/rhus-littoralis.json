    "intro": "Rhus littoralis, commonly known as coastal waxnut, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, simple, ovate to elliptic leaves that turn reddish in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by spiny, globose fruits that contain one or two seeds. It thrives in coastal areas, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils, making it an important component of dune ecosystems. Its ecological value includes providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
