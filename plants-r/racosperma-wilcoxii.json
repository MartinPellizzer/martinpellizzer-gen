    "intro": "Racosperma wilcoxii, commonly known as Wilcox's acacia, is a flowering plant native to northern Australia. It is a small shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid regions, characterized by its woody stems and bipinnate leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in spherical inflorescences, which are often visited by various pollinators. Its seeds are enclosed in pods and are adapted to disperse in dry conditions, contributing to its survival in harsh environments. Racosperma wilcoxii is part of the legume family and has a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria."
