    "intro": "Rubus ignoratiformis, commonly known as the Pacific madrone, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is native to the western United States and parts of Canada, typically growing in coastal forests and mountainous regions. The plant is characterized by its smooth, reddish bark and clusters of white to pink flowers that bloom in spring. Its fruits are small, red berries that ripen in late summer and are often consumed by birds and mammals. The leaves are alternate, simple, and have a distinctive waxy coating that helps reduce water loss in its often dry habitats."
