    "intro": "Rhaponticum pungens, commonly known as the Siberian spinach or Russian spinach, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to eastern Europe and western Asia. It features a basal rosette of stiff, pungent, and hairy leaves, which are edible when young. The plant produces yellow composite flowers in late summer, followed by small, spiky fruits. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soils. Due to its nutritional value and hardiness, it is cultivated as a leafy green vegetable in some regions."
