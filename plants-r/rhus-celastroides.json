    "intro": "Rhus celastroides, commonly known as the smooth sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and turn vibrant red in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by red, fuzzy berries that are a food source for birds. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils. Its botanical features make it a valuable component of native plant ecosystems."
