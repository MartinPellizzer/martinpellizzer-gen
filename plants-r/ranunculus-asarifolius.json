    "intro": "Ranunculus asarifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaved buttercup, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, cup-shaped flowers that typically range in color from white to yellow. The plant features trifoliate leaves with finely divided lobes, and its stems are often covered in soft, woolly hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in some regions."
