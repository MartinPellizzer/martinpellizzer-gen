    "intro": "Ranunculus pilicauliformis, commonly known as the alpine buttercup, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at elevations above 3,000 meters. The plant features showy yellow flowers with five to nine sepals that resemble petals, and its leaves are palmately divided with a distinctive hairy texture. It has a short growing season and is adapted to cold, harsh environmental conditions. Ranunculus pilicauliformis plays a role in alpine ecosystems and is often found in meadows and open slopes."
