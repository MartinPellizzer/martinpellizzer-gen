    "intro": "Rhus glaucescens, commonly known as the smooth sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and turn vibrant red in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by red, fuzzy fruits that are edible for birds and some mammals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or along roadsides. Its botanical features make it a valuable plant for ecological restoration and wildlife habitat."
