    "intro": "Rhus crenata, commonly known as smooth sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and have finely serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in upright clusters, followed by red, fuzzy fruit clusters that persist into winter. Its leaves and fruits contain toxic compounds, making it potentially harmful if ingested. Rhus crenata is often found in dry, open woodlands and thrives in full sun to partial shade."
