    "intro": "Rhododendron dendritrichum, commonly known as the creeping rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils and thrives in shaded to partially shaded environments. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, while its flowers range in color from pink to white. Rhododendron dendritrichum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to form thick, ground-covering mats."
