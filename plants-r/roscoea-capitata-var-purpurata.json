    "intro": "Roscoea capitata var. purpurata, commonly known as the purple-leafed roscoea, is a striking ornamental plant native to the Himalayas. It is a rhizomatous herbaceous perennial with thick, fleshy rhizomes that store water, allowing it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. The plant produces tall, upright stems adorned with lance-shaped, dark green leaves that have a distinctive purple underside. Its showy, red-orange flowers appear in late spring to early summer, clustered in dense, terminal inflorescences. It is valued in gardens for its ornamental foliage and unique floral display, though it requires careful cultivation to thrive."
