It features dense, compact growth with small, rounded leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in compact, globular clusters, which are typical of the Acacia family. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showing resilience to drought conditions. Its unique appearance and hardy nature make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
