It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its woody stems and palmate leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white in color. It thrives in high-altitude environments and is adapted to the cool, moist conditions of its native habitat. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
