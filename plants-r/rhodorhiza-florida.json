    "intro": "Rhodorhiza florida, commonly known as the Florida rhodorhiza, is a rare and unique flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Zingiberaceae, which includes gingers, and is characterized by its striking, fragrant inflorescences. The plant features lance-shaped leaves with a waxy texture and produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and requires partial to full sunlight for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
