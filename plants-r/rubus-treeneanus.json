    "intro": "Rubus treeneanus, commonly known as the Treenean blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are rich in antioxidants. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
