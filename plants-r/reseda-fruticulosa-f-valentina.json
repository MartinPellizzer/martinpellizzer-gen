    "intro": "Reseda fruticulosa f. valentina, commonly known as the Valentina lady's mantle, is a compact, low-growing perennial plant native to southern Europe. It features dense, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color, covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by ornamental, papery bracts that remain on the plant well into autumn. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or borders. Its unique foliage and extended flowering period make it a valuable addition to ornamental gardens."
