    "intro": "Ramium mollicoma, commonly known as velvetleaf, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its soft, velvety leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellow in color. It thrives in moist, rich soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and agricultural fields. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes, it is considered a weed in many regions."
