    "intro": "Ruschia macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaved Ruschia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features fleshy, upright stems and large, waxy, gray-green leaves that are often ribbed. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the spring and summer. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil with full sun exposure. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
