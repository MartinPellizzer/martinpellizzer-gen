    "intro": "Ranunculus anisodon, commonly known as the spiked buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves with hairy surfaces and bright yellow flowers that have five to seven petals. The plant produces a cluster of small, greenish-brown achenes as its fruit, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in alpine or subalpine habitats. Ranunculus anisodon is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate, early spring blooms."
