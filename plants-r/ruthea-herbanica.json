    "intro": "Ruthea herbanica, commonly known as the meadow rue, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Ranunculaceae and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and large, palmately divided leaves. The plant produces showy, yellowish-green to reddish flower clusters in late summer, which are composed of numerous small, petal-like sepals. Ruthea herbanica prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
