    "intro": "Rosa nivalis, commonly known as the snow rose, is a perennial shrub native to the alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the snow has fully melted. The plant typically grows in rocky or mountainous terrain, where it thrives in cold, well-drained soils. Its leaves are compound, with five to seven elliptical leaflets, and its stems are covered in fine, white hairs. Rosa nivalis is valued for its ornamental beauty and its ability to withstand harsh winter conditions."
