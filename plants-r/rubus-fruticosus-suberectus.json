    "intro": "Rubus fruticosus suberectus, commonly known as the brambles or blackberry shrub, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its thorny stems, which are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces aggregate fruits, known as drupes, which are typically dark purple to black in color when mature. Its leaves are compound, consisting of three to five leaflets, and are usually serrated along the edges. This species is often found in hedgerows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade."
