    "intro": "Rubus serpens var. cuspidiger, commonly known as the hooked blackberry, is a perennial shrub native to parts of North America. It is characterized by its thorny stems and trifoliate leaves, which are typically serrated along the edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that ripen to a dark red or black color, often appearing in late summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
