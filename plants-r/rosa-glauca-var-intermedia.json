    "intro": "Rosa glauca var. intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate bluebush rose, is a shrub-like species native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and small, dark green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of pale blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cooler, drier climates. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and visual interest."
