    "intro": "Ranunculus chaerophyllos subsp. flabellatus, commonly known as the flabellate buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and bright yellow, saucer-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. It is often found in alpine meadows and is adapted to cold climates. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in some regions."
