    "intro": "Rauvolfia maxima, commonly known as the Indian snakeroot, is a tropical climbing shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It is characterized by its woody stems, heart-shaped leaves, and clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers. The plant produces berries that are typically orange or red when ripe, containing several seeds. Rauvolfia maxima is notable for containing the alkaloid reserpine, which has historically been used in traditional medicine. Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and pharmacological contexts."
