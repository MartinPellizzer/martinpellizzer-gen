It is characterized by its prickly stems and small, aggregate fruits that develop from multiple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it produces white to pale pink flowers in the spring. This subspecies is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing soil in harsh mountain environments."
