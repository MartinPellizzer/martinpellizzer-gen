    "intro": "Rhizanthemum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and unique flowering plant native to the rainforests of Australia. It is characterized by its lack of leaves and roots, relying instead on its specialized aerial roots to absorb nutrients from the air. The plant produces small, delicate white or pink flowers that bloom in the summer months. Rhizanthemum is often found growing on the trunks of trees, where it can access the moisture and nutrients it needs. Due to its fragile nature and limited habitat, it is considered a critically endangered species."
