    "intro": "Rhinanthus elephas, commonly known as the common yellow rattle, is a flowering plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients while still performing photosynthesis. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom from June to August, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in grassland habitats and is often found in meadows and along roadsides. Rhinanthus elephas plays an important ecological role in promoting biodiversity by encouraging the growth of other plant species through its parasitic relationship."
