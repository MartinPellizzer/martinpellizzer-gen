    "intro": "Reimaria puberula, commonly known as the hairy reindeer lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in cold, moist environments. It is characterized by its dense, hairy texture and a pale to dark green or brownish coloration. This lichen is typically found on tree trunks and branches in boreal and subarctic regions. Its growth is slow, and it plays a role in nutrient cycling in forest ecosystems. Reimaria puberula is also used as an indicator species for air quality due to its sensitivity to pollution."
