    "intro": "Rubus cernuus, commonly known as the creeping blackberry, is a species of bramble native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with arching stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are edible but have a tart flavor. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the flowers are typically white or pale pink. Rubus cernuus is often found in disturbed soils and along woodland edges, thriving in moist, shaded environments."
