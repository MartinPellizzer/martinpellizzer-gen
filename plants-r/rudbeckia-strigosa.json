    "intro": "Rudbeckia strigosa, commonly known as the rough coneflower, is a perennial herb native to the northeastern United States. It features upright, hairy stems that support its daisy-like flowers, which bloom in late summer with yellow centers and orange to red petals. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, stiff hairs, giving it a rough texture. Rudbeckia strigosa prefers moist to wet soils and is often found in marshy areas or along stream banks. It is a valuable plant for pollinators, providing nectar for bees and butterflies."
