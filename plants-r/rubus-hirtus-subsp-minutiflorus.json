    "intro": "Rubus hirtus subsp. minutiflorus, commonly known as the small-flowered bramble, is a shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, thorny stems and small, trifoliate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of white to pale yellow flowers in late spring, followed by red, hairy berries that are edible but often tart. It thrives in moist, wooded areas and is often found in the understory of forests. This subspecies is notable for its compact growth and adaptability to shaded environments."
