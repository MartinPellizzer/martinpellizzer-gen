    "intro": "Rumex divaricatus, commonly known as narrowleaf dock, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are often reddish or purple-veined, especially along the midrib. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters during the summer months, which are typically followed by reddish-brown seed capsules. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides, in meadows, and near water sources. Due to its hardy nature, it is considered a common weed in many regions."
