    "intro": "Rapistrum pygmaeum, commonly known as the dwarf wall rocket, is a low-growing, annual plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes other mustard family plants. The plant typically reaches a height of only a few centimeters, with small, lance-shaped leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and along walls. Its seeds are small and can be dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas."
