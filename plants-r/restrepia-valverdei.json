    "intro": "Restrepia valverdei, commonly known as the Valverde's orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the high Andes of Peru. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces narrow, grass-like leaves and bears inflorescences with small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink. It thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
