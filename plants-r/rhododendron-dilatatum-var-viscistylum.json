    "intro": "Rhododendron dilatatum var. viscistylum, commonly known as the sticky leaf rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage, with leaves that are often covered in a sticky substance, which is a natural defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to red, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It prefers acidic, well-drained soils and thrives in shaded to partially shaded environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as part of native plant restoration projects."
