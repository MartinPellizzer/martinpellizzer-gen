It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and clusters of fragrant, pink or white flowers that bloom repeatedly throughout the growing season. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface, and its flowers are typically borne in groups of three to five. It is well adapted to temperate climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and hardiness. The variety is prized for its ability to produce blooms throughout the summer and into the fall."
