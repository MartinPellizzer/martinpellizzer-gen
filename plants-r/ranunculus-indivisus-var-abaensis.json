    "intro": "Ranunculus indivisus var. abaensis, commonly known as the Aba ranunculus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to specific regions of China. It features showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous areas with cool, temperate climates. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
