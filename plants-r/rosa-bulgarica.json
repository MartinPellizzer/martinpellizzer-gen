    "intro": "Rosa bulgarica, commonly known as the Bulgarian rose, is a species of shrub native to the mountainous regions of Bulgaria. It is prized for its fragrant, deep pink to red flowers, which are widely used in the production of rose essential oil and perfume. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters and features thorny stems and pinnate leaves. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it thrives in well-drained soils with full sun exposure. The plant's botanical significance is further enhanced by its role in traditional medicine and its economic importance in the perfume industry."
