    "intro": "Rhodosphaera rhodanthema, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a rare and endangered species native to the island of Madagascar. It is a small evergreen tree characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and dense, fragrant foliage. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by woody, cone-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it faces significant conservation challenges. Its unique botanical features make it an important subject for ecological and botanical study."
