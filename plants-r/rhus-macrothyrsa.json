    "intro": "Rhus macrothyrsa, commonly known as the smooth sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically pinnately arranged with 11 to 31 leaflets. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by red, fuzzy berries that are a food source for birds and wildlife. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is adaptable to a variety of soil types. Rhus macrothyrsa is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to tolerate urban conditions."
