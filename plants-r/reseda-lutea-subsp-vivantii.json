It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for rock gardens or dry landscapes.
