    "intro": "Rubia tenuifolia subsp. stenophylla, commonly known as narrow-leafed gentian, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of blue to purple flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
