It belongs to the family Celastraceae and is characterized by its dense, hard wood and thick, leathery leaves. The plant typically grows in mountainous regions and is adapted to cool, humid climates. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, while its fruits are capsules that release seeds upon maturity. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
