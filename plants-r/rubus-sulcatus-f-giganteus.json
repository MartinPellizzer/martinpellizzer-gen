    "intro": "Rubus sulcatus f. giganteus, commonly known as the giant blackberry, is a variant of the common blackberry species. It is characterized by its large, robust growth habit and thorny stems. The plant produces large, dark purple to black berries that are typically larger than those of the standard Rubus sulcatus. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils. Its botanical features make it a striking and sometimes invasive plant in certain regions."
