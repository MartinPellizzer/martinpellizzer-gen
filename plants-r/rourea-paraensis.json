    "intro": "Rourea paraensis, commonly known as the Paraensis Rourea, is a tropical shrub native to the Amazon rainforest. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are often glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that release seeds when mature. Due to its habitat and limited distribution, Rourea paraensis is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
