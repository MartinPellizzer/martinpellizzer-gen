    "intro": "Regelia grandiflora, commonly known as the grandiflora regelia, is a striking member of the Bromeliaceae family. Native to South America, particularly Brazil, it is a perennial evergreen plant that thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its most notable feature is its large, showy, waxy flowers that can reach up to 12 inches in diameter. The plant produces a rosette of broad, strap-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of hair. Regelia grandiflora is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
