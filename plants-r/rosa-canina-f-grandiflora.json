    "intro": "Rosa canina f. grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered dog rose, is a botanical variant of the common dog rose. It is characterized by its larger, more showy flowers compared to the typical Rosa canina. The plant produces pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its hips, which are orange-red fruits, are similar to those of the common dog rose but may be slightly larger. This subspecies is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes."
