    "intro": "Ranunculus saxatilis, commonly known as the saxifrage buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to rocky and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It features basal leaves that are deeply lobed and covered in a dense layer of silky, white hairs. The plant produces showy yellow flowers with five petals, often surrounded by a ring of sepals that resemble additional petals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, sunny environments. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is often found in crevices and on rocky slopes."
