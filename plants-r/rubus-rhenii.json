    "intro": "Rubus rhenii, commonly known as the Siberian blackberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the cold climates of Siberia and northern China. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are rich in antioxidants and have a tart flavor. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires a long, cold winter for proper fruit development. Due to its hardiness, it is often cultivated in regions with harsh winters and is valued for both its ornamental and edible qualities."
