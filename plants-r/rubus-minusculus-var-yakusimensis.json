    "intro": "Rubus minusculus var. yakusimensis, commonly known as the Yakutsk raspberry, is a rare shrub native to the Russian Far East and northern Japan. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its small, red or yellow berries that ripen in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as mountain forests and rocky slopes. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it produces thorny stems. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
