    "intro": "Rhamnus rugulosa, commonly known as the smooth buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, woodlands and along stream banks, reaching heights of up to 6 feet. The plant features small, oval-shaped leaves that are dark green on top and pale underneath. Its flowers are clustered in small, greenish-yellow catkins, and it produces small, dark berries that are an important food source for birds. The bark is smooth and grayish, with a distinctive, aromatic scent when crushed."
