    "intro": "Rosa \u00d7 hyacinthina, commonly known as the double-flowered hybrid rose, is a popular ornamental plant cultivated for its showy, full blooms. It is a cross between Rosa chinensis and Rosa damascena, resulting in a plant with dense, layered petals that resemble a ball of tissue paper. The shrub typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters and features thorny stems with dark green, serrated leaves. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. This variety is prized for its long blooming period and is often used in gardens and floral arrangements."
