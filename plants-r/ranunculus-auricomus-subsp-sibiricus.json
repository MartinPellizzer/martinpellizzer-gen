    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus subsp. sibiricus, commonly known as the Siberian buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the colder regions of Asia. It features delicate, bright yellow flowers with five to eight petals, often with a distinctive golden center. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in meadows, woodlands, and along streambanks. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in cooler climates. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant blooms."
