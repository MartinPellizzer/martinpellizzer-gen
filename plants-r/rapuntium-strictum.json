    "intro": "Rapuntium strictum, commonly known as the rigid cress, is a flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and small, cruciform flowers that typically bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, round seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its wide distribution. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and slightly hairy, while its stems are slender and often branched. Rapuntium strictum is often found in moist soils along streambanks and in disturbed areas, making it a common weed in agricultural settings."
