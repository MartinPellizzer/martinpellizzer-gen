    "intro": "Romulea tempskyana, commonly known as the Tempsky's glory-of-the-snow, is a bulbous perennial plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its striking, daffodil-like flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces narrow, grass-like leaves and has a short, underground corm as its storage organ. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is often cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
