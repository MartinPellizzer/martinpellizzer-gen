    "intro": "Regelia coriacea, commonly known as the roughleaf regelia, is a striking evergreen shrub native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is characterized by its thick, leathery, and often hairy leaves that give it a distinctive texture. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, typically during the summer months. Regelia coriacea thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
