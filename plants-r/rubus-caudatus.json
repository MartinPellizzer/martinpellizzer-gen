    "intro": "Rubus caudatus, commonly known as the trailing blackberry, is a species of bramble native to western North America. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and thorny stems, which help it to climb and spread across the ground. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically harvested in late summer. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the flowers are white with five petals. Rubus caudatus thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in forest understories."
