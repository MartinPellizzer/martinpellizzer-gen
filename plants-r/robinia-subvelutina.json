    "intro": "Robinia subvelutina, commonly known as the silky honey locust, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are followed by flat, bean-like pods containing several seeds. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in dry, open habitats. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and showy flowers, making it a popular choice for landscaping."
