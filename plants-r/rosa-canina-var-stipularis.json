    "intro": "Rosa canina var. stipularis, commonly known as the dog rose with stipules, is a botanical variant of the dog rose. It is characterized by its distinctive stipules, which are small leaf-like structures at the base of the petioles. This variety typically produces fragrant pink or white flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant is deciduous, shedding its leaves in the autumn, and has thorny stems that provide structural support. It is often found in hedgerows and woodland edges, thriving in well-drained soils."
