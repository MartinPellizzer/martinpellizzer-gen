It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that have a silvery underside, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by fruit that resembles a small, round berry. Rauia ulei is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine. Its growth habit is generally slow, making it suitable for small garden spaces."
