It is characterized by its dark, glossy berries and silvery undersides on its leaves. The plant typically grows in shrub form, with thorny stems and compound leaves. It produces small, white flowers that bloom in the spring. The berries are edible, though they are generally less flavorful compared to other blackberry varieties."
