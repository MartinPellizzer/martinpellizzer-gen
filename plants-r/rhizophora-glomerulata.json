    "intro": "Rhizophora glomerulata, commonly known as the mangrove fern, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia and northern Australia. It is characterized by its unique root system, which includes prop roots that help stabilize the plant in waterlogged, saline soils. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that are pollinated by insects and birds. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that release buoyant seeds, aiding in dispersal by water. Rhizophora glomerulata plays a vital role in coastal ecosystems by preventing erosion and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species."
