    "intro": "Richetia induplicata, commonly known as the double-leaf fern, is a rare and unique species belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that consist of two overlapping layers of leaves, giving it its common name. The plant is native to the mountainous regions of Central America, particularly in Mexico and Guatemala. Its fronds are typically slender and have a delicate, feathery appearance. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Richetia induplicata is considered a rare and endangered species."
