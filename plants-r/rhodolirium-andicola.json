    "intro": "Rhodolirium andicola, commonly known as the Andean lily, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the Liliaceae family and is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the nutrient-poor soils of its native habitat. Its leaves are typically broad and lance-shaped, and it produces bulbous structures that aid in its survival in harsh conditions. Rhodolirium andicola is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable climates."
