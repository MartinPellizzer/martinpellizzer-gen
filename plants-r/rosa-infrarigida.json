    "intro": "Rosa infrarigida, commonly known as the alpine rose, is a species of flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Alps and other mountainous regions in Europe. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dark green, velvety leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Rosa infrarigida is adapted to cold climates and is often found in rocky or alpine meadows. Its botanical features make it a hardy and resilient plant suitable for cultivation in cooler gardens."
