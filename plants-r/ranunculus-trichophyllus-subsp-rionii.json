    "intro": "Ranunculus trichophyllus subsp. rionii, commonly known as the Rion Island buttercup, is a rare and endemic species native to the Rion Island in Georgia. It is a herbaceous perennial with delicate, yellow flowers that typically bloom in early spring. The plant features palmate leaves with a hairy surface, which is a distinguishing characteristic of the subspecies. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
