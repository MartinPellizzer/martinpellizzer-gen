    "intro": "Ranunculus kunthii, commonly known as the yellow crowfoot, is a herbaceous perennial native to the western United States. It features bright yellow flowers with five to eight petal-like sepals, which are often mistaken for true petals. The plant has a basal rosette of finely divided, fern-like leaves that are hairy and aromatic. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Ranunculus kunthii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
