    "intro": "Ranunculus carinatus, commonly known as the spiked buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features bright yellow flowers with a distinctive central ridge, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters and has palmately divided leaves. Its flowers bloom from late spring to early summer, and it prefers moist, well-drained soils. Ranunculus carinatus is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks."
