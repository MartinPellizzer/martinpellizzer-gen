    "intro": "Robinia \u00d7 holdtii f. britzensis, commonly known as the Britzen's false acacia, is a hybrid shrub or small tree belonging to the legume family Fabaceae. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically trifoliate or pinnate, and its showy, fragrant yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is native to the southeastern United States and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. It has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion, and it is relatively drought-tolerant once established. The fruit is a legume pod that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals."
