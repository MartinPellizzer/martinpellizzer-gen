It is characterized by its dark purple to black berries, which are typically larger and more intensely flavored than those of other Rubus species. The plant produces trifoliate leaves with serrated edges and grows as an erect shrub with thorny stems. It thrives in temperate climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. This variety is valued for its culinary uses and is often cultivated for its unique, sweet-tart fruit."
