    "intro": "Romulea flexuosa, commonly known as the zigzag glory-of-the-snow, is a perennial bulbous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range from white to pink and are often speckled with purple. The plant produces a cluster of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a rosette near the ground. Romulea flexuosa thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. It is a popular ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
