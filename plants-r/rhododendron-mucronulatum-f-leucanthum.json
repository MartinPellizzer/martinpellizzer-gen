    "intro": "Rhododendron mucronulatum f. leucanthum, commonly known as the White-flowered Snowy Bush, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces clusters of showy, white flowers with a pinkish tinge, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often cultivated in USDA hardiness zones 6 through 9."
