    "intro": "Rosa reuteri var. transiens, commonly known as the Transient Rock Rose, is a compact shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant has narrow, dark green leaves and a woody stem structure typical of many rose species. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Due to its limited natural range, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its ornamental value and historical significance."
