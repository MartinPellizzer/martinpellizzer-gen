    "intro": "Rosa micrantha var. subnuda, commonly known as the naked-stemmed rose, is a shrub-like species native to the eastern United States. It features slender, often hairless stems and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in the spring. The leaves are compound, consisting of five to seven oval leaflets with serrated edges. This variety is characterized by its lack of thorns, making it less defensive compared to other rose species. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats."
