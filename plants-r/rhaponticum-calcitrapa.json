It is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped, hairy leaves and a flowering stem that bears yellow ray flowers. The plant thrives in rocky, arid environments and is adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions. Its leaves are edible and have been used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Rhaponticum calcitrapa is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil in rocky habitats."
