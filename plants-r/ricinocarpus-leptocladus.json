    "intro": "Ricinocarpus leptocladus, commonly known as the slender-branching ricin tree, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its unique, palm-like leaves and clusters of small yellow flowers. The plant produces a toxic seed capsule, which contains ricin, a potent toxin used in various biological research applications. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland forests and coastal areas. Due to its toxic properties, it is handled with caution in both ecological and agricultural contexts."
