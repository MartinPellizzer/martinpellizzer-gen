    "intro": "Rubus micans var. aurigeranus, commonly known as the golden-leaf raspberry, is a variant of the bramble genus Rubus. It is characterized by its distinctive golden-yellow undersides on its leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, red, edible berries similar to other Rubus species. It is native to parts of Europe and is often found in woodland edges and hedgerows. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its striking foliage and potential for fruit production."
