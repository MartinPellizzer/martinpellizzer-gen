    "intro": "Rhynchospora uniflora, commonly known as the single-flower marsh sedge, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems. The plant produces a single, upright flower spike that bears small, three-lobed flowers, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Rhynchospora uniflora thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. It plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and birds."
