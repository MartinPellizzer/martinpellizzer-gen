It is characterized by its slender, arching stems and small, white to pale pink flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces small, edible berries that are typically black when mature, though they may retain a reddish tinge. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland edges and stream banks. Its botanical features make it an important component of riparian ecosystems."
