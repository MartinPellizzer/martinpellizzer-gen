    "intro": "Rosa canina f. firmula, commonly known as the firm-fruit dog rose, is a botanical variant of the common dog rose. It is characterized by its dense, thorned stems and clusters of fragrant pink flowers that bloom in early summer. The fruit, or rose hip, is notably firmer and more rounded compared to the typical Rosa canina, making it distinctive in appearance. This subspecies is often found in hedgerows and woodland edges across Europe. Its botanical features make it a valuable subject for both horticultural study and ecological research."
