    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus subsp. afzelii, commonly known as the golden crowfoot, is a herbaceous perennial native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It features bright yellow flowers with 5-15 petal-like sepals, often surrounded by a crown of white or pale green bracts. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in meadows, woodlands, and stream banks. Its leaves are trifoliate, with lobed or palmate divisions, and it produces a basal rosette of foliage. The subspecies afzelii is distinguished by its more elongated petals and slightly different leaf morphology compared to the typical form of R. auricomus."
