    "intro": "Rosa myriacantha var. rupestris, commonly known as the rock rose, is a shrub-like plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It features dense, thorny stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant is adapted to dry conditions, with small, leathery leaves that reduce water loss. It produces rose-like flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. This variety is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and hardy nature."
