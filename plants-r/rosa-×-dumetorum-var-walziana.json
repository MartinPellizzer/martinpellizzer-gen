    "intro": "Rosa \u00d7 dumetorum var. walziana, commonly known as the Walz's shrub rose, is a compact, shrub-like species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features dense, thorny stems and dark green, oval-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink to red, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It is well adapted to rocky and arid environments, making it a hardy choice for landscaping in challenging conditions. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its persistent, showy hips that remain on the plant throughout the winter."
