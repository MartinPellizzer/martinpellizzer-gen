    "intro": "Ronabea viscoides, commonly known as the sticky ronabea, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, waxy foliage that gives it a distinctive, almost rubbery texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or greenish in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
