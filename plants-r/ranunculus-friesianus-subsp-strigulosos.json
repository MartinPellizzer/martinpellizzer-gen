    "intro": "Ranunculus friesianus subsp. strigulosos, commonly known as the Friesian buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to parts of Europe. It features delicate, palmate leaves with a hairy texture, and its flowers are typically yellow with five petals. The plant thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. It blooms from late spring to early summer, producing clusters of small, showy flowers. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and protected species in some regions."
