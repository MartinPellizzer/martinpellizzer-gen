It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by dark red, elongated fruits. Its roots and stems contain alkaloids and pigments, making it historically significant for dye production. This variety is often found in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky soils and open woodlands."
