    "intro": "Rhus copallinum subsp. leucantha, commonly known as white sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and turn bright red in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in upright clusters, followed by red, fuzzy fruit clusters that persist into winter. Its bark is smooth and gray, with a distinct, aromatic scent when crushed. White sumac is often found in open woodlands and disturbed sites, and it plays a role in supporting local wildlife."
