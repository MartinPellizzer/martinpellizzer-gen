It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family, characterized by its showy, often yellow or white flowers. The plant features simple, palmately lobed leaves and produces small, clustered flowers with five petals. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
