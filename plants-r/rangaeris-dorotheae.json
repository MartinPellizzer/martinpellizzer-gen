It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its striking blue or violet bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss.
