    "intro": "Rumex \u00d7 murbeckii, commonly known as the hybrid sorrel, is a perennial plant belonging to the Polygonaceae family. It is a natural hybrid between Rumex acetosa (common sorrel) and Rumex acetorum (garden sorrel), exhibiting characteristics of both parents. The plant typically has broad, heart-shaped leaves with a reddish or purple tinge on the underside, and it produces small, greenish flowers in clusters. It thrives in moist, fertile soils and is often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. Due to its hybrid nature, it is not typically cultivated for ornamental or agricultural purposes."
