    "intro": "Rubus obscurus var. insericatus, commonly known as the woolly blackberry, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and thorny stems, which contribute to its rugged appearance. The plant produces small, dark berries that are typically inedible due to their high acidity and astringent taste. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas and along stream banks. Botanically, it is notable for its complex inflorescence and its role in supporting local wildlife."
