    "intro": "Rubus euryacanthus, commonly known as the alpine blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, thorny stems and small, dark purple to black berries that ripen in late summer. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments, often growing in rocky or alpine soils with limited nutrients. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the flowers are typically pink or white. Due to its habitat, it is a rare and specialized plant, adapted to cold climates and low oxygen levels."
