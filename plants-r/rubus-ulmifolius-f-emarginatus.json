    "intro": "Rubus ulmifolius f. emarginatus, commonly known as the serrated bramble, is a subspecies of the common bramble, characterized by its distinctive serrated leaf margins. It is a shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia, typically found in woodlands and hedgerows. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are often red or black in color, which are edible but have a tart flavor. Its leaves are usually broad and have a slightly hairy texture, and it is known for its robust growth habit. The subspecies is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
