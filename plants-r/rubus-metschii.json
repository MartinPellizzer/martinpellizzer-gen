It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and thorny stems, typical of many Rubus species. The plant produces small, dark red to black berries that are edible but often have a tart flavor. Its leaves are compound, with three to five leaflets, and are covered in fine hairs. Rubus metschii thrives in moist, temperate climates and is often found in forest edges and shrublands."
