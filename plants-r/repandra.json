    "intro": "Repandra, commonly known as the orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Orchidaceae. These plants are characterized by their complex, often showy flowers and specialized structures such as the labellum and column. Repandra species are typically epiphytic or lithophytic, growing on trees or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. They possess a well-developed root system and often have pseudobulbs for storing water and nutrients. The flowers exhibit a wide variety of colors and shapes, adapted for specific pollinators."
