    "intro": "Rosa berdaui, commonly known as the Armenian rose, is a species of flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and parts of Turkey. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring thorny stems and broad, dark green leaves. The plant produces fragrant, pink to red flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in racemes. Its botanical characteristics include simple, ovate leaves and a woody structure typical of many rose species. Rosa berdaui is valued both for its ornamental qualities and its historical significance in traditional medicine."
