It typically grows in shallow coastal waters, estuaries, and brackish marshes. The plant has slender, ribbon-like leaves that are often submerged or floating. Its small, greenish flowers are arranged in dense clusters and are pollinated by wind. This subspecies is important for stabilizing coastal sediments and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
