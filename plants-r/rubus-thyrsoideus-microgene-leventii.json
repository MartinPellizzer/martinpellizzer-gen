    "intro": "Rubus thyrsoideus microgene leventii, commonly known as the Leningrad raspberry, is a species of bramble native to the Caucasus region. It is characterized by its slender, arching canes and small, aggregate fruits that are typically red when ripe. The plant has trifoliate leaves with serrated edges and produces white flowers in early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
