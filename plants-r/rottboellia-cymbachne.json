    "intro": "Rottboellia cymbachne, commonly known as carpet grass, is a tropical perennial grass species native to the Americas. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, pale blue to purple flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, lawns, and disturbed areas. Rottboellia cymbachne is noted for its rapid growth and ability to form a dense ground cover, making it both a common weed and a useful plant in erosion control."
