    "intro": "Rudbeckia chrysomela, commonly known as the golden rudbeckia, is a herbaceous perennial native to the central and eastern United States. It features bright yellow ray flowers surrounding a central disk of dark orange to brown florets, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows to a height of 2 to 3 feet, with upright, hairy stems and lance-shaped, dark green leaves. It blooms from late summer to early autumn, producing showy flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Rudbeckia chrysomela is well-suited for gardens and naturalized areas due to its hardiness and low maintenance requirements."
