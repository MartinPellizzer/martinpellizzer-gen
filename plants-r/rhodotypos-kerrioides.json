    "intro": "Rhodotypos kerrioides, commonly known as the kerrioides rhodotypos, is a rare and striking plant native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is characterized by its dense, spherical clusters of bright orange to red flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, needle-like leaves that are evergreen and provide year-round interest. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Due to its limited natural range and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive species requiring careful cultivation."
