    "intro": "Rubus rigiduliformis, commonly known as the rigid thimbleberry, is a species of bramble native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and prickly stems, which are covered in fine, stiff hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in the spring, followed by edible berries that ripen to a bright red color in late summer. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the plant thrives in moist, shady environments. Rubus rigiduliformis plays an important role in local ecosystems, providing food for wildlife and supporting pollinator populations."
