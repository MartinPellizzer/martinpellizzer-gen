    "intro": "Rapuntium aquaticum, commonly known as watercress, is a flowering plant that thrives in aquatic or semi-aquatic environments. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, edible leaves. The plant produces small white or yellow flowers that attract pollinators such as bees. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from water, allowing it to grow in shallow, freshwater habitats. Watercress is often found in streams, ditches, and wetlands across temperate regions."
