It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its native habitat. Its showy, tubular flowers are typically pink or red, attracting pollinators like hummingbirds and bees. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and greenhouses."
