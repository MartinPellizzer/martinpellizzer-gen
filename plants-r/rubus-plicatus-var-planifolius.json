    "intro": "Rubus plicatus var. planifolius, commonly known as the flat-leaf raspberry, is a variant of the raspberry plant native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its flat, broad leaves and small, aggregate fruits that are typically red when ripe. The plant thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its flowers are white or pale pink and are borne in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees. The fruit is edible, though it is less commonly cultivated compared to other raspberry varieties."
