    "intro": "Ruellia subsericea, commonly known as the silky ruellia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically blue or purple in color, which bloom throughout the growing season. Ruellia subsericea is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and long-lasting blooms. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is relatively easy to grow in warm, humid climates."
