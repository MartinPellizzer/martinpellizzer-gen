    "intro": "Ruscus latifolius, commonly known as common spurge or butcher's broom, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to Europe and western Asia. It features dense clusters of fleshy, spiny leaves that form a compact, mat-like structure. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in the spring, followed by red berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value. Ruscus latifolius is also valued in traditional medicine for its purported medicinal properties."
