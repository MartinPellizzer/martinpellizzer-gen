    "intro": "Ranunculus flagelliformis, commonly known as the creeping buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a low-growing, spreading habit with slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers with five petal-like sepals, typical of the Ranunculaceae family. Its leaves are usually deeply lobed and arranged alternately along the stems. Ranunculus flagelliformis thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges."
