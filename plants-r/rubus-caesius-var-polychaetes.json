    "intro": "Rubus caesius var. polychaetes, commonly known as the purple-fruited blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dark purple to black berries, which are typically smaller than those of other Rubus species. The plant produces compound leaves with serrated edges and has thorny stems typical of the Rubus genus. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodlands and hedgerows. The berries are edible but are generally less sweet and more tart compared to common blackberries."
