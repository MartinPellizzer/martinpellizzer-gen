It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring opposite, elliptic leaves with a smooth texture. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the summer months. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.
