    "intro": "Romulea rosea var. australis, commonly known as the Southern Crown Imperial, is a perennial bulbous plant native to southern Africa. It produces striking, showy flower spikes with bright orange or yellow flowers that resemble a crown, typically blooming in spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and thrives in well-drained soil with full sun exposure. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and rockeries. The variety 'australis' is distinguished by its slightly different flower color and growth habit compared to the typical form of Romulea rosea."
