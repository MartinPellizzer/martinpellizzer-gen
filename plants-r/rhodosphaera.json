    "intro": "Rhodosphaera, commonly known as the rose sponge or sea sponge, is a type of marine organism that belongs to the class Hexactinellida. It is characterized by its intricate network of siliceous spicules, which form a porous, sponge-like structure. Rhodosphaera thrives in deep ocean environments, often found in the mesopelagic and bathypelagic zones. Its translucent body is typically pink or red in color, giving it its common name. This organism plays a role in the marine ecosystem by contributing to the silica cycle and providing habitat for smaller marine life."
