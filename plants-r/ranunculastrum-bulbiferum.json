    "intro": "Ranunculastrum bulbiferum, commonly known as the bulbous ranunculus, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its attractive, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow, orange, and red. The plant has a short, herbaceous stem and produces small, bulb-like structures at the base, which help it survive in dry conditions. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three leaflets that are hairy and lobed. Ranunculastrum bulbiferum prefers well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers."
