It features delicate, showy flowers with five to eight yellow petals and a greenish-yellow center, typically blooming in early spring. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are alternate and often covered in a waxy coating. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade.
