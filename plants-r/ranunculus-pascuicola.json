    "intro": "Ranunculus pascuicola, commonly known as the meadow buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist meadows, grasslands, and woodland edges, preferring well-drained soil. The plant features bright yellow, cup-shaped flowers with 5 to 13 petals, and its leaves are palmately divided with a hairy texture. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies. Ranunculus pascuicola is often found in disturbed soils and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
