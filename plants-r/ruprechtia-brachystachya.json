It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbel-like flower clusters. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30\u201360 cm, featuring slender stems and finely divided, fern-like leaves. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.
