    "intro": "Rubus imbricatus var. subrotundatus, commonly known as the broad-leaf blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to North America. It is characterized by its broad, rounded leaves and thorny stems, which are typical features of the Rubus genus. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that ripen to a dark purple or black color, often used in jams and desserts. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a food source for wildlife and its genetic diversity within the Rubus species."
