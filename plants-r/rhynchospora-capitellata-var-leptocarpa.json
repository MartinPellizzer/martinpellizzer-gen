    "intro": "Rhynchospora capitellata var. leptocarpa, commonly known as the slender-stemmed spikerush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist to wet soil conditions. The plant has tall, cylindrical inflorescences composed of small, spike-like clusters of flowers, which are usually pale green to brown in color. Its leaves are grass-like, narrow, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. This variety is distinguished by its slender stems and is often found in association with other wetland plants in ecologically diverse environments."
