    "intro": "Rubus tomentosus microgene tomentosifrons, commonly known as the woolly blackberry, is a shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is characterized by its dense, white-tomentose (fuzzy) foliage and stems, which provide insulation and protection against environmental stress. The plant produces small, dark red berries that are typically consumed by birds and other wildlife. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its botanical features make it an important component of native ecosystems and a subject of study in plant ecology."
