It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of tubular, pink to red flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Its compact size and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening.
