    "intro": "Ranunculus subhomophyllus subsp. cylleneus, commonly known as the Alpine buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, thriving in cool, moist environments. The plant features delicate, yellow flowers with five petals and a prominent central stigma, characteristic of the Ranunculaceae family. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a hairy surface that helps reduce water loss in high-altitude conditions. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
