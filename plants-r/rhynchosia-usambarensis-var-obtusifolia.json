It features trifoliate leaves with heart-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers. The plant bears pods that contain edible, kidney-shaped seeds, which are rich in protein and nutrients. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides. Due to its nutritional value, it is cultivated as a food crop in some regions."
