    "intro": "Rubus arduennensis microgene sericeus, commonly known as the silky raspberry, is a rare shrub native to the humid forests of Central America. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its slender, thornless stems covered in fine, silken hairs. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or orange in color, with a distinctive, fragrant aroma. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a soft, velvety texture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species requiring conservation efforts."
