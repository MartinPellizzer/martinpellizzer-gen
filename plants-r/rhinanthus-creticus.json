    "intro": "Rhinanthus creticus, commonly known as the Cretan flame flower, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, commonly known as the broomrape family, and is characterized by its striking orange-red flowers. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially depends on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its blooming period occurs during the summer months, making it a notable species in its native ecosystems."
