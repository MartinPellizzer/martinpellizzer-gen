    "intro": "Rubus infestior, commonly known as the brambles or blackberry shrub, is a member of the Rosaceae family. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that give way to edible berries in the summer. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils. Its extensive root system allows it to spread rapidly, making it both a valuable food source and a potential invasive species."
