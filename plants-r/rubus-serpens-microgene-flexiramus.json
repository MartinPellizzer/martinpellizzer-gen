    "intro": "Rubus serpens microgene flexiramus, commonly known as the creeping raspberry, is a perennial shrub native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features compound leaves with serrated edges and produces small, aggregate fruits known as drupes. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed habitats. Its stems are covered in fine, glandular hairs, and it has a sprawling growth habit. The species is notable for its ability to spread vegetatively through runners, making it both a resilient and sometimes invasive plant."
