    "intro": "Rebutia einsteinii subsp. aureiflora, commonly known as the golden-flowered rebutia, is a compact, low-growing cactus native to South America. It features cylindrical stems that are often ribbed and covered in white to pale green spines. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, adding a striking visual contrast to its green foliage. It is well-suited for rock gardens and containers due to its compact size and drought tolerance. Its ornamental value comes from both its unique shape and vibrant floral display."
