    "intro": "Rubus rivularis var. eutrichus, commonly known as the river raspberry, is a shrub native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its trailing or prostrate growth habit, with slender stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits composed of numerous drupes, typically red or yellow in color. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated margins, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as streambanks and woodland edges. It is an important species for pollinators and has been used in traditional medicine for its astringent properties."
