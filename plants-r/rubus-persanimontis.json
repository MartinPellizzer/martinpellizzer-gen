    "intro": "Rubus persanimontis, commonly known as the Persimmon Rubus, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, white to pink flowers that bloom in early summer. Its fruit, a small, red or black berry, is edible and has a tart flavor. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
