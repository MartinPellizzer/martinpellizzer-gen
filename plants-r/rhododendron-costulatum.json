    "intro": "Rhododendron costulatum, commonly known as the alpine rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. The plant features lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white or grayish pubescence. Its flowers are typically pink or red, appearing in clusters and blooming in late spring to early summer. Rhododendron costulatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in harsh, cold climates."
