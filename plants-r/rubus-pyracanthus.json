    "intro": "Rubus pyracanthus, commonly known as the Chinese firethorn, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, bright red berries that persist through winter. The plant has compound leaves with serrated edges and produces white to pinkish flowers in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. Due to its ornamental value and invasive potential in some regions, it is often cultivated with caution."
