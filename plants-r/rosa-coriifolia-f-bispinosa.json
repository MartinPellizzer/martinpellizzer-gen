    "intro": "Rosa coriifolia f. bispinosa, commonly known as the double-spined shrub rose, is a compact, deciduous shrub native to China. It features dense, thorny stems and is characterized by its showy, double pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The foliage consists of small, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy texture. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in gardens for its hardiness and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. It prefers full sun to partial shade and is relatively low maintenance once established."
