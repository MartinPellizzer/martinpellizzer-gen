    "intro": "Ripartia pyrenaica, commonly known as the Pyrenean bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped blue or violet flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky and sunny habitats, often at elevations above 1,000 meters. Its leaves are lanceolate and covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Ripartia pyrenaica is a perennial species that plays a role in the alpine flora of its native range."
