    "intro": "Rosa haeggdangerensis, commonly known as the Haggard's rose, is a rare and delicate shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features slender stems covered in soft, grayish-white bark, and its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a finely serrated margin. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its flowers are followed by small, red-orange hips that contain seeds, and the plant is adapted to cold, arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
