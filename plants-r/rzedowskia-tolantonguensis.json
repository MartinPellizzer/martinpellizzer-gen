    "intro": "Rzedowskia tolantonguensis, commonly known as the Tolantongo tree, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Oaxaca, Mexico. It is a member of the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive bipinnate leaves and yellow-orange flowers. The plant thrives in humid, temperate climates and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species. Its ecological importance lies in its role as a habitat for various endemic fauna and its potential medicinal properties."
