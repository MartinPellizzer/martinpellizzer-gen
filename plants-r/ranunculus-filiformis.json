    "intro": "Ranunculus filiformis, commonly known as the slender buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features delicate, bright yellow flowers with 5 to 15 sepals that resemble petals, and it typically grows in moist, calcareous soils. The plant has a short, stout rhizome and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. It blooms from late spring to early summer and is often found in meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges. Its botanical characteristics make it a notable species in ecological studies and ornamental gardening."
