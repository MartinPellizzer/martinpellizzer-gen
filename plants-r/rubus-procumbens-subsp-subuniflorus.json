    "intro": "Rubus procumbens subsp. subuniflorus, commonly known as the single-flower blackberry, is a low-growing shrub native to parts of North America. It produces small, dark red berries that are typically solitary on each inflorescence, distinguishing it from other Rubus species. The plant has trifoliate leaves with serrated margins and produces white to pale pink flowers in the spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its berries are edible but are often less palatable than those of other blackberry varieties."
