    "intro": "Rhus kwazuluana, commonly known as the Natal buckthorn, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It typically grows in coastal and inland forested areas, preferring well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate in shape, with a glossy green upper surface and a lighter underside. It produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers followed by small, fleshy berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
