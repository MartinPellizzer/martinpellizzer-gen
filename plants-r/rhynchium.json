    "intro": "Rhynchium, commonly known as the stolon in certain orchid species, is a specialized plant structure that serves as a horizontal, underground stem. It plays a crucial role in the propagation and survival of the plant by producing new shoots and roots. The rhynchium is often covered in a thin layer of tissue that protects it from environmental stress. It is distinct from other plant stems due to its ability to generate both vegetative and reproductive structures. This unique botanical feature is essential for the growth and distribution of orchids in various habitats."
