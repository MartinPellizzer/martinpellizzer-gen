    "intro": "Rosa vanescens var. benevanescens, commonly known as the sweet briar rose, is a shrub-like plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features thorny stems and is characterized by its fragrant, pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are compound, consisting of five to seven oval-shaped leaflets, and the plant produces red-orange hips in the fall. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and historical use in hedgerows and gardens. This variety is closely related to the common wild rose, Rosa rugosa."
