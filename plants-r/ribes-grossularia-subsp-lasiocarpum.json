    "intro": "Ribes grossularia subsp. lasiocarpum, commonly known as the downy gooseberry, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green berries that are typically covered in a fine, downy coating. These berries are edible but have a tart flavor and are often used in jams and preserves. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forested areas at higher elevations."
