    "intro": "Rubus eximius, commonly known as the evergreen blackberry shrub, is a species of bramble native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is characterized by its dense, thorny growth habit and dark green, leathery leaves. The plant produces small, edible blackberries that ripen in late summer, often with a tart and slightly sweet flavor. Its flowers are white and clustered, and the plant is often found in moist, shaded woodlands. Rubus eximius is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance as a food source for wildlife."
