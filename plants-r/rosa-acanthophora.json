    "intro": "Rosa acanthophora, commonly known as the thorned rose, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and clusters of fragrant pink or white flowers. The plant produces small, oval-shaped fruits known as hips, which contain seeds surrounded by a hairy, red outer layer. Rosa acanthophora is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and adaptable member of the rose family."
