It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant produces edible berries that are typically red or orange when ripe, though they are often too tart for direct consumption. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. The species is valued for its ornamental value and its role in supporting local wildlife."
