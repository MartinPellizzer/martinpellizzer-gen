    "intro": "Rubus tereticaulis var. ovatus, commonly known as the ovate trailing raspberry, is a species of brambles native to parts of eastern North America. It is characterized by its slender, trailing growth habit and small, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of white to pale yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, hairy berries in the fall. Its stems are often armed with thorns, and it is commonly found in moist, wooded areas. This variant is distinguished from other Rubus species by its unique leaf shape and growth pattern."
