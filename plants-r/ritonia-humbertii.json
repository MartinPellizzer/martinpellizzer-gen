    "intro": "Ritonia humbertii, commonly known as the Humbert's ritonia, is a rare flowering plant native to the humid lowland forests of western Africa. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae, which includes milkweeds and related species, and is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters, with dark green, glossy leaves. Its flowers are usually pink to purple in color and bloom during the wet season, attracting various pollinators. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Ritonia humbertii is considered endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists."
