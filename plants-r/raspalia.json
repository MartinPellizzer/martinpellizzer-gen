    "intro": "Raspalia, commonly known as the \"flower of the moon,\" is a rare and exotic plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It features striking, bioluminescent petals that glow softly under moonlight, a unique adaptation for attracting nocturnal pollinators. The plant has a complex root system that allows it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils, and its leaves are covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Raspalia blooms only once every seven years, making it a highly sought-after specimen in botanical gardens. Its scientific classification remains a subject of ongoing research due to its unusual genetic makeup."
