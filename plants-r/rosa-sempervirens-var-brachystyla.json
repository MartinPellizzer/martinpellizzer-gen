    "intro": "Rosa sempervirens var. brachystyla, commonly known as the compact rose or dwarf evergreen rose, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and dark green, leathery leaves that remain evergreen throughout the year. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white, typically blooming in spring and summer. It is well-suited for container gardening and as a hedging plant due to its compact growth habit. The variety is prized for its ornamental value and hardiness in mild climates."
