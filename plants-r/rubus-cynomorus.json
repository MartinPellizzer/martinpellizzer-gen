    "intro": "Rubus cynomorus, commonly known as blackberry bramble, is a species of shrub in the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces edible blackberries, which are rich in antioxidants and have a sweet-tart flavor. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils. Its growth habit makes it both a valuable food source and a persistent weed in agricultural areas."
