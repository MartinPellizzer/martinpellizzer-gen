    "intro": "Retanilla crassa, commonly known as the thick-stemmed retanilla, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its distinct, often aromatic foliage. It typically grows in moist, temperate environments and is known for its sturdy, branching stems that can reach several feet in height. The plant produces small, white to yellowish flowers arranged in umbels, which are typical of the carrot family. Its leaves are usually pinnately divided, with a rough texture and a strong, sometimes pungent scent. Retanilla crassa is valued in traditional medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties."
