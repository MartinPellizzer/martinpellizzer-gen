    "intro": "Rhigozum, commonly known as beach holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Serpyllaceae. These plants are typically shrubs or small trees, characterized by their evergreen leaves and small, often showy flowers. Rhigozum species are adapted to coastal environments, thriving in sandy or salty soils. They have a woody structure and are often found in dune habitats, where they help stabilize sand. The genus includes several species, such as Rhigozum robustum, which is native to the eastern coast of North America."
