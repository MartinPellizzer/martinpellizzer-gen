    "intro": "Ruschia altigena, commonly known as the silver leaf Ruschia, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Aizoaceae family, commonly referred to as the ice plant family, and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and vibrant, daisy-like flowers. The plant produces small, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in spring and summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Ruschia altigena is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
