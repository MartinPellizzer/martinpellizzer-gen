    "intro": "Rosa trachyphylla f. godetae, commonly known as the Godet's bristly rose, is a unique horticultural form of the bristly rose species. It is characterized by its dense, glandular hairs that cover the stems and leaves, giving it a distinctive, rugged appearance. The plant produces fragrant, pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and thrives in well-drained soils with full sun exposure. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
