    "intro": "Rumex triangulivalvis var. oreolapathum, commonly known as the oreolapathum dock, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of eastern North America. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has alternate, lanceolate leaves with serrated margins, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters during the spring. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies. The species is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
