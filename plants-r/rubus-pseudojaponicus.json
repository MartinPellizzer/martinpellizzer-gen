    "intro": "Rubus pseudojaponicus, commonly known as the Japanese blackberry, is a species of bramble native to East Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, dark red to black berries. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are palmately lobed with a rough, hairy texture. The berries are edible when ripe but are often used in traditional medicine for their antioxidant properties."
