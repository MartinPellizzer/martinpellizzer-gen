    "intro": "Rhaphithamnus pallidus, commonly known as the pale thornbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, pale green leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its seeds are enclosed in small, capsule-like fruits that split open when mature. Rhaphithamnus pallidus is well-suited to harsh environmental conditions and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
