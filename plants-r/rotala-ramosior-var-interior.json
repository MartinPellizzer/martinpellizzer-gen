    "intro": "Rotala ramosior var. interior, commonly known as the Indian waterwheel plant, is a floating aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It features whorled leaves that are often submerged, with the upper leaves extending above the water surface. The plant has a branched stem system that allows it to spread rapidly in water bodies. It is often used in aquariums for its aesthetic appeal and ability to oxygenate water. Its growth is influenced by water clarity, light intensity, and nutrient availability."
