    "intro": "Rubus perperus, commonly known as the evergreen blackberry, is a species of bramble native to parts of Asia and Australia. It is characterized by its thorny stems, trifoliate leaves, and small, dark purple to black berries. The plant is typically shrub-like, with a woody structure that persists through multiple growing seasons. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, and it produces fruit in late summer to early autumn. The berries are edible, though they are often used in jams and preserves due to their tart flavor."
