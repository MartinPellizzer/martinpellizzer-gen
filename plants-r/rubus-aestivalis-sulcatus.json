It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and thorny stems, typical of many Rubus species. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or yellow when mature, containing multiple tiny seeds. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and usually have a serrated edge. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or hedgerows."
