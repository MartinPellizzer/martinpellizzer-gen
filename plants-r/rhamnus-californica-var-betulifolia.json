    "intro": "Rhamnus californica var. betulifolia, commonly known as the California buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to coastal regions of California. It features compound leaves with serrated edges and small, dark purple berries that are edible for some bird species. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in chaparral and coastal scrub habitats. It has a distinctive bark that becomes fissured with age, and its flowers are small, greenish-yellow catkins. This species plays an important ecological role in supporting local wildlife and stabilizing soil in its native environment."
