    "intro": "Rhus canadensis var. illinoensis, commonly known as Illinois blackberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the central United States. It belongs to the Anacardiaceae family and is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries in the fall. These berries are edible but have a tart flavor and are often used in local cuisine or as a natural dye. The plant is also valued for its ecological role in supporting wildlife and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types."
