    "intro": "Rhododendron augustinei f. album, commonly known as the white-flowered rhododendron, is a unique variant of the species Rhododendron augustinei. It is characterized by its pale to white flowers, which contrast with the typical pink or red hues of its parent species. This form is typically found in the mountainous regions of Yunnan Province in China, where it thrives in cool, humid climates. The plant is an evergreen shrub with leathery, dark green leaves and produces showy inflorescences. Its botanical significance lies in its ornamental value and its role in the biodiversity of its native habitat."
