    "intro": "Rhododendron batemanii, commonly known as the Bateman's rhododendron, is a species native to the Himalayas, particularly in Nepal and northern India. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows at high altitudes, often in moist, shaded forest environments. The plant features lance-shaped leaves that are dark green and covered in a fine, silky layer of white hairs. Its flowers are showy, with deep pink to purple petals that bloom in early spring. Rhododendron batemanii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique foliage and floral characteristics."
