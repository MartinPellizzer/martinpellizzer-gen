    "intro": "Rubus serpens var. appendiculatus, commonly known as the appendiculate blackberry. It is a variant of the blackberry plant native to parts of Southeast Asia, particularly Malaysia and Indonesia. The plant is characterized by its trailing growth habit and thorny stems, which help it spread along the ground. Its leaves are typically trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it produces small, aggregate fruits that are usually dark purple to black in color. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its edible berries."
