    "intro": "Rhinanthus apterus, commonly known as the common yellow toadflax, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, characterized by its parasitic growth habit, although it is not entirely parasitic and can photosynthesize. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands. It produces showy yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its distinctive appearance and ecological role make it an important species in its native environments."
