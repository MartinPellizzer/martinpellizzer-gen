    "intro": "Rhadinothamnus rudis subsp. linearis, commonly known as the narrow-leafed thornbush, is a shrub native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often branched stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in spikes during the spring, which are followed by small, woody fruits. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found on rocky soils. This subspecies is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in rehabilitation projects due to its ability to stabilize soil."
