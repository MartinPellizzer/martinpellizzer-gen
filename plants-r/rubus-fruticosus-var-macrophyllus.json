    "intro": "Rubus fruticosus var. macrophyllus, commonly known as the large-leaf blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves and thorny stems, which are typical features of the Rubus genus. The plant produces aggregate fruits composed of small, dark purple to black berries. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in hedgerows, woodlands, and disturbed soils. Due to its robust growth and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated for both its berries and its aesthetic appeal."
