    "intro": "Rebutia tafnaensis, commonly known as the Tafna Rebutia, is a species of cactus native to Algeria. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and is often adorned with spines and sometimes flowers. The plant features a ribbed stem that helps it store water, a crucial adaptation to its arid environment. Its flowers, typically yellow or orange, bloom during the warmer months. Rebutia tafnaensis is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
