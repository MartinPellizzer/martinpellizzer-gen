    "intro": "Rosa corymbifera subsp. deseglisei, commonly known as the Desert rose or Desert Rosa, is a shrub-like plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its thorny stems and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or white. The plant has leathery, narrow leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. It produces small, oval fruits that contain numerous seeds. This subspecies is well-suited for xeriscaping and is often used in landscaping in regions with limited water availability."
