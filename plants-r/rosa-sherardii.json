It is native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe, including parts of the Alps and the Carpathians. The plant is characterized by its upright growth habit, thorny stems, and clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets, and the plant produces red, hairy fruits known as hips in the autumn. Rosa sherardii is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been cultivated for both its beauty and historical significance in horticulture."
