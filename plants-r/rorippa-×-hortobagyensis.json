    "intro": "Rorippa \u00d7 hortobagyensis, commonly known as the hybrid watercress, is a naturally occurring hybrid between Rorippa palustris and Rorippa sylvestris. It is a herbaceous annual plant that typically grows in moist or aquatic environments, such as stream banks and wet meadows. The plant has alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating, and it produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters. Its seeds are dispersed by water, allowing it to colonize new areas effectively. This species is valued for its edible leaves, which are similar in taste to watercress and are used in various culinary applications."
