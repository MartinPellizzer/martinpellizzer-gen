    "intro": "Rubus rigidus var. sterilis, commonly known as the sterile blackberry. This variant is a shrub native to parts of Europe and Asia, characterized by its thorny stems and dense, dark green foliage. Unlike its fertile relatives, it produces flowers but does not bear fruit, making it unique among the Rubus genus. The plant thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study."
