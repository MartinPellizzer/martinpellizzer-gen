    "intro": "Rosa micrantha subsp. ferociformis, commonly known as the ferocious form of the small thorned rose, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and small, oval-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The flowers are typically pale pink to white, with five petals and numerous stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer. This subspecies is adapted to high-altitude environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions with well-drained soil. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it requires specific care to thrive."
