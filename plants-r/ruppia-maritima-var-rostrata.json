    "intro": "Ruppia maritima var. rostrata, commonly known as the rostrate sea rocket, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline and brackish water environments. It is a perennial herb with submerged and floating leaves, often found in coastal marshes and estuaries. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are typically borne in spikes, and it has a widespread distribution along the Atlantic and Pacific coasts. Its reproductive strategy involves both sexual and vegetative propagation, allowing it to colonize new areas efficiently. The species plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sediments and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
