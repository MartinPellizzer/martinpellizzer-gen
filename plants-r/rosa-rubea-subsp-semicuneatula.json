    "intro": "Rosa rubea subsp. semicuneatula, commonly known as the red rosebush, is a subspecies native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its dense, shrub-like growth habit and its production of small, intensely red flowers. The leaves are typically trifoliate, with deeply lobed leaflets that have a distinctive, almost heart-shaped appearance. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its botanical features make it both ornamental and ecologically valuable in native habitats."
