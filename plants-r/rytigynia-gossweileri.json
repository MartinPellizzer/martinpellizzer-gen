    "intro": "Rytigynia gossweileri, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a small evergreen tree native to the Atlantic rainforests of Brazil. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its dense, dark reddish-brown wood, which is highly valued for its tonal qualities in musical instruments. The plant has simple, opposite, and elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. It produces small, fragrant white flowers followed by red, fleshy fruits that contain seeds. Due to overharvesting, it is now classified as an endangered species, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
