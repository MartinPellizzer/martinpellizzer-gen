    "intro": "Rhinanthus montanus, commonly known as the alpine bird's-beak, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, commonly known as the broomrape family, and is characterized by its striking yellow-orange flowers. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. It thrives in open, sunny habitats such as alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its unique floral structure and ecological role make it an important species in high-altitude ecosystems."
