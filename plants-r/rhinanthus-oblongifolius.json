    "intro": "Rhinanthus oblongifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leafed common tickseed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, commonly known as the broomrape family, and is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and showy inflorescence make it easily identifiable in its native range."
