    "intro": "Rhysolepis radula, commonly known as the common rock fern, is a small, perennial fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors, rock crevices, and stream banks. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome with clusters of small, lance-shaped leaves. Its fronds are usually less than 10 cm in length and have a delicate, feathery appearance. Rhysolepis radula reproduces via spores, which are released from the sori located on the underside of its fronds."
