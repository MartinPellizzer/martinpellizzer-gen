    "intro": "Rosa afzeliana var. incana, commonly known as the woolly rose, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its grayish-white, fuzzy stems and leaves, which provide a distinctive appearance. The plant produces fragrant pink to white flowers in the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its foliage is often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
