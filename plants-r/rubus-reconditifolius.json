It is characterized by its dark purple to black berries, which are typically small and tart. The plant has compound leaves with serrated edges and produces white or pale pink flowers in the spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or shaded areas. Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a problematic weed in certain regions."
