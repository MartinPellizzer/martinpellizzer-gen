    "intro": "Rubus scabrifolius, commonly known as the rough-leaved blackberry, is a species of bramble native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its prickly stems and dark, edible berries that ripen in late summer. The leaves are typically oval with a rough, sandpapery texture, which gives the plant its scientific name. It thrives in woodland edges and disturbed soils, often forming dense thickets. The plant is valued both for its ornamental qualities and its role in supporting local wildlife."
