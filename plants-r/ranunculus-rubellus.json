    "intro": "Ranunculus rubellus, commonly known as the red avens, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features delicate, hairy stems that often grow in moist, woodland environments. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, typically blooming from May to July. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a distinctive hairy texture, and the plant prefers shady, well-drained soils. Ranunculus rubellus is often found in meadows, stream banks, and forest edges, contributing to the biodiversity of these habitats."
