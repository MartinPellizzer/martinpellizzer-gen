It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically blue or purple in color. Ruellia pubescens thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or partially shaded environments. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to bloom throughout the growing season."
