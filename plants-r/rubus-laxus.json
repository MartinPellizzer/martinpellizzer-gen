It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and small, dark berries. The plant features compound leaves with serrated edges and produces fragrant white flowers in the spring. Its fruits are typically edible, though they are smaller and less sweet compared to common blackberries. Rubus laxus is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
