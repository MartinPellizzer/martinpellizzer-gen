It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and has small, ovate leaves that often wrap around the stems, giving it a unique appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences. Its foliage is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties. The species is adapted to grow in moist, shaded environments, typically in tropical or subtropical regions."
