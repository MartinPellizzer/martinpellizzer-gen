    "intro": "Rubus jensenii var. spribillei, commonly known as the Spribille's blackberry, is a rare and distinctive variant of the blackberry genus. It is characterized by its dark, almost black berries that are typically smaller than those of other Rubus species. The plant is native to specific regions in the western United States, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. Its foliage consists of compound leaves with serrated edges, and it produces thorny stems typical of many Rubus species. The flowers are usually white or pale pink, and they bloom in early spring before the fruits mature."
