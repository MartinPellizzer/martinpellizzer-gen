    "intro": "Rubus incertus, commonly known as the uncertain blackberry, is a species of bramble native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It belongs to the Rubus genus, which includes many shrubs with thorny stems and aggregate fruits. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and its flowers are small, white, and clustered in the axils of the leaves. The fruit, a dark purple to black berry, is edible but often has a tart flavor."
