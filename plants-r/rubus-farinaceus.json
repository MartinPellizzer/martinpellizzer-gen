    "intro": "Rubus farinaceus, commonly known as the silverleaf bramble, is a species of flowering plant in the rose family. It is characterized by its silvery-white undersides on its leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, red berries that are typically edible but not widely cultivated. It is native to regions of North America and is often found in woodland areas and along stream banks. Rubus farinaceus is a shrub that can grow up to several meters tall and is known for its thorny stems and clusters of white flowers."
