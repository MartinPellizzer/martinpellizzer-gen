It features short, cylindrical stems covered in dense, woolly hair, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the summer months, adding ornamental value. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting."
