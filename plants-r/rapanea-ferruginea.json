    "intro": "Rapanea ferruginea, commonly known as the rusty-leafed evergreen, is a small to medium-sized tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage that turns a reddish-brown during the dry season. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by orange or red berries. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in lowland forests or along riverbanks. Its hardy nature and ornamental value make it a popular choice for horticultural use in warm regions."
