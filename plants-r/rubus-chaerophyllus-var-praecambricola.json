    "intro": "Rubus chaerophyllus var. praecambricola, commonly known as the creeping bramble, is a species of shrub native to the British Isles. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early summer, followed by red, edible berries. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodland edges and hedgerows. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and declining species in parts of its native range."
