    "intro": "Ranunculus echinatus, commonly known as the echinatus buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features striking, showy flowers with five to nine broad, yellow petals and a distinctive central cone-shaped structure made up of numerous small, hooked sepals. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with palmately divided, heart-shaped leaves that are hairy and serrated. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Ranunculus echinatus prefers well-drained, moist soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats."
