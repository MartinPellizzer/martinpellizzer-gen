    "intro": "Rochefortia acrantha, commonly known as the desert bell, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often appearing in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are small, narrow, and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Rochefortia acrantha is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
