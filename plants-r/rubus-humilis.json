    "intro": "Rubus humilis, commonly known as the lowly raspberry shrub, is a species of bramble native to the northern regions of North America. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring slender, arching stems covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits known as raspberries, which are typically red but can also be yellow or orange in color. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three leaflets that are oval to lanceolate in shape and have serrated edges. Rubus humilis thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and open fields."
