    "intro": "Rhododendron hirsutum f. glabratum, commonly known as the smooth-leaved rhododendron, is a compact evergreen shrub native to the eastern Himalayas. It features broad, ovate to elliptical leaves that are typically smooth and leathery, distinguishing it from its rough-leaved parent species. The plant produces dense clusters of bell-shaped, fragrant flowers in shades of pink to red, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for rock gardens and shaded borders. It prefers acidic, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, thriving in cool, moist climates."
