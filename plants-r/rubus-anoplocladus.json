It is characterized by its upright growth habit and thorny stems, typical of many Rubus species. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or black in color, similar to other raspberries. Its leaves are palmately compound, with five to seven leaflets that are usually serrated. Rubus anoplocladus thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes."
