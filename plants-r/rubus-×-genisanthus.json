    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 genisanthus, commonly known as the hybrid blackberry raspberry, is a deciduous shrub belonging to the Rosaceae family. It is a natural hybrid between Rubus ursinus (the blackberry) and Rubus idaeus (the red raspberry), resulting in a plant that exhibits characteristics of both parents. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark red to black in color, with a tart flavor. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges or disturbed soils. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is cultivated in gardens and agricultural settings."
