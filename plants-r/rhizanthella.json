    "intro": "Rhizanthella, commonly known as the underground orchid, is a unique plant species native to Australia. It is notable for its lack of above-ground leaves and stems, with all its photosynthetic activity occurring through its underground stems. The plant relies on a symbiotic relationship with specific fungi to obtain nutrients, which is essential for its survival. Rhizanthella produces flowers that are typically pale yellow or white, and they bloom only once every few years. Due to its rarity and specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a critically endangered species."
