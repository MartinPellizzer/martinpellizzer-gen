    "intro": "Ranunculus curvilobus, commonly known as the bent-lobed buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features showy, yellow flowers with five to eight sepals that are often reflexed, giving the plant its distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. Its leaves are palmately divided with lobes that curve inward, contributing to its common name. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
