It is characterized by its deep green, almost black, foliage that contrasts strikingly with its pale pink to white flowers. The plant is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring thornless stems and a compact, rounded growth habit. Its leaves are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a soft, velvety texture. This variety is prized for its ornamental value, especially in shady or partially shaded garden settings."
