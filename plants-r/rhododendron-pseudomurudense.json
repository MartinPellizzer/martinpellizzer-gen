It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils and thrives in shaded to semi-shaded environments. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, providing a striking contrast to the vibrant floral displays. This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and specialized horticultural settings."
