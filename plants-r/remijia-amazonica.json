    "intro": "Remijia amazonica, commonly known as the Amazonian bellflower, is a herbaceous plant native to the rainforests of South America. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments and has lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. Its flowering period occurs during the wet season, and it plays a role in supporting local pollinators. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
