It is characterized by its full, layered blooms that consist of multiple petals, giving it a more elaborate appearance than single-flowered roses. The plant typically has a shrub-like growth habit with thorny stems and dark green, serrated leaves. It produces fragrant flowers in a range of colors, including pink, red, and white, often in late spring to early summer. Rosa \u00d7 bifera is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
