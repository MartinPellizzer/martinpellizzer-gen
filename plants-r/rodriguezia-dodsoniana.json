    "intro": "Rodriguezia dodsoniana, commonly known as the purple rodriguezia, is a striking member of the Anacardiaceae family native to the Caribbean. It is characterized by its large, glossy, dark green leaves that often have a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, white flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its fruit is a spiny, woody capsule that splits open to release its seeds. Due to its ornamental value and rarity, it is often cultivated in tropical gardens and botanical collections."
