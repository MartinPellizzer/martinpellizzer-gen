    "intro": "Rhynchosia diversifolia, commonly known as the variable spurred bean, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its climbing habit and trifoliate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing several seeds. Rhynchosia diversifolia thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as forest edges and agricultural areas. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
