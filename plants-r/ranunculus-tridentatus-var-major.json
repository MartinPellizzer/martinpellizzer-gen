    "intro": "Ranunculus tridentatus var. major, commonly known as the giant water buttercup, is a perennial aquatic plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It thrives in shallow freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes, where it forms dense floating mats. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves with a waxy surface that helps repel water, and its flowers are yellow with numerous stamens. It produces small, oval seeds that are dispersed by water currents. Due to its invasive nature, it can outcompete native species and alter aquatic ecosystems."
