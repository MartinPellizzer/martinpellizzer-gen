    "intro": "Robbrechtia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and ethereal flowering plant native to the rainforests of Brazil. It is characterized by its delicate, white, orchid-like flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees rather than in soil, and relies on specific humidity and light conditions to thrive. Its leaves are long and strap-like, often covered in a fine, silvery coating that helps reduce water loss. Due to its unique appearance and endangered status, Robbrechtia is highly sought after in both botanical gardens and the horticultural trade."
