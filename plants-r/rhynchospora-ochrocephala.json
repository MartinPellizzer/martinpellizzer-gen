    "intro": "Rhynchospora ochrocephala, commonly known as the yellow-headed spikerush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States. It typically grows in marshy areas, swamps, and along the edges of ponds and lakes. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in dense spike-like clusters. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands in wet soils. Rhynchospora ochrocephala plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wetland organisms."
