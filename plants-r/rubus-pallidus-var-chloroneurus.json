    "intro": "Rubus pallidus var. chloroneurus, commonly known as the pale bramble or green-veined raspberry. This variant is characterized by its slender, thorny stems and small, pale green leaves with distinct chlorotic veins. The flowers are typically white or pale pink, and the fruits are small, tart berries that ripen in late summer. It is native to parts of Europe and is often found in woodland edges and open habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species."
