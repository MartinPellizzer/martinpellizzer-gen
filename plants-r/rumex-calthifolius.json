    "intro": "Rumex calthifolius, commonly known as narrow-leaved sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive reddish or purple underside, which are typically smooth and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its leaves are edible but contain oxalic acid, so they should be consumed in moderation."
