It is characterized by its woody stems covered in a sticky, glandular pubescence. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or yellow in color. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including woodlands and disturbed areas. Due to its invasive tendencies, it can outcompete native vegetation in certain regions."
