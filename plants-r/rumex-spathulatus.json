    "intro": "Rumex spathulatus, commonly known as broadleaf sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features upright, branched stems that are often reddish in color, and its leaves are broad, heart-shaped, and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are edible and have a sour taste due to the presence of oxalic acid. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks."
