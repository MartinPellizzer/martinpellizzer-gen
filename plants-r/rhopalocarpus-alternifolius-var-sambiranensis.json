    "intro": "Rhopalocarpus alternifolius var. sambiranensis, commonly known as the Sambiranensis rhopalocarpus, is a rare and lesser-known plant species native to specific regions in Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are often glossy and have a distinct venation pattern. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences, which are pollinated by insects. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
