    "intro": "Roegneria nutans, commonly known as the nodding wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Asia and North America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with silver or blue. The plant produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences that droop gracefully, giving it its common name. Roegneria nutans is adapted to a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, sandy or loamy soils. It is often found in open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed areas."
