    "intro": "Rosa schmidtii var. genuina, commonly known as the Schmidt's rose, is a rare and endangered shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems, fragrant pink to white flowers, and dark green, serrated leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat loss, it is critically important for conservation efforts in its native range."
