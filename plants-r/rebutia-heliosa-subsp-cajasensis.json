    "intro": "Rebutia heliosa subsp. cajasensis, commonly known as the Cajasensis Rebutia, is a member of the Cactaceae family native to South America. This species is characterized by its compact, globular shape and dense clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring. Its stems are typically ribbed and covered with short, pale spines, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a container plant. It is relatively low maintenance, requiring minimal water during its dormant period."
