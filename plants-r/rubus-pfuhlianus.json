    "intro": "Rubus pfuhlianus, commonly known as the alpine bramble, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and small, clustered leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces white to pale pink flowers in early summer, followed by edible berries that are often used in local cuisines. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
