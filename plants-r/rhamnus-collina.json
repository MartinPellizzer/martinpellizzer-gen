    "intro": "Rhamnus collina, commonly known as the coastal buckthorn, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its small, oval leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by dark blue berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in coastal areas and is adapted to sandy or well-drained soils. Rhamnus collina is often found in maritime climates and is known for its hardiness in salty and wind-swept environments."
