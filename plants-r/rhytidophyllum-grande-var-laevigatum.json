It is characterized by its large, smooth, waxy leaves that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces large, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with high humidity and well-drained soil. Due to its rarity and unique appearance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
