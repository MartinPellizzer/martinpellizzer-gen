    "intro": "Rubus macroacanthus var. oblonga, commonly known as the broad-leaf blackberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its large, lobed leaves and thorny stems, which are typical features of the Rubus genus. The plant produces aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black when mature, containing numerous small drupes. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and thickets. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a food source for wildlife and its potential use in ornamental horticulture."
