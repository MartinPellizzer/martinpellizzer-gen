    "intro": "Rosa canina f. pedunculipilosa, commonly known as the bristly dog rose, is a botanical variant of the common dog rose. It is characterized by its distinctive bristly stems and hairy foliage, which are adaptations to its native environments. The plant produces fragrant pink or white flowers that bloom in early summer. Its hips, like those of the common dog rose, are edible and contain high levels of vitamin C. This subspecies is often found in woodland edges and scrublands across Europe and parts of Asia."
