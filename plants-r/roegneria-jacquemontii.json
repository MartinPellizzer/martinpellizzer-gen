    "intro": "Roegneria jacquemontii, commonly known as the Jacquemont's wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Roegneria jacquemontii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and visual interest."
