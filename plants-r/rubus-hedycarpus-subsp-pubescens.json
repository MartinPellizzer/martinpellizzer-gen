    "intro": "Rubus hedycarpus subsp. pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent bramble, is a shrub native to parts of Asia, particularly China. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits known as drupes, which are typically red or black when mature. Its flowers are white or pale pink, and it thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil. The subspecies is distinguished by its dense pubescence, or hairy covering, on its stems and leaves."
