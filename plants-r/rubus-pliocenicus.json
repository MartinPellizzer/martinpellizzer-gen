It belongs to the Rosaceae family, which includes other berry-producing plants like strawberries and blackberries. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves and clusters of small, red, edible fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial shade, often found in forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and historical significance, it is considered a valuable species for botanical research."
