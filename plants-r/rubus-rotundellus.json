    "intro": "Rubus rotundellus, commonly known as the red raspberry. It is a species of bramble native to Europe and parts of Asia, characterized by its trailing growth habit and thorny stems. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red when ripe, containing numerous tiny drupes. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it has a shallow root system that allows it to thrive in a variety of soil types. Rubus rotundellus is often cultivated for its edible fruits and is also used in traditional herbal medicine."
