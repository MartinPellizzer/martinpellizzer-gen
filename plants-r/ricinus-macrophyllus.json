    "intro": "Ricinus macrophyllus, commonly known as the giant castor oil plant, is a striking member of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that can reach up to 30 inches in diameter. The plant produces unique, spiky seed capsules that contain toxic seeds, making it both a botanical curiosity and a potential hazard. Its rapid growth and ornamental value make it a popular choice for tropical gardens, though it requires careful management due to its invasive potential. The plant's ability to thrive in warm, humid climates highlights its adaptability and ecological significance."
