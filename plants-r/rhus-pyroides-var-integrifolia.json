    "intro": "Rhus pyroides var. integrifolia, commonly known as the smooth sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It features compound leaves with 11 to 31 oval, serrated leaflets that are smooth and glossy on the upper surface. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by red, fuzzy berries that persist into winter. Its bark is smooth and light gray, becoming fissured with age. It is often found in moist to wet soils along streambanks and in woodlands."
