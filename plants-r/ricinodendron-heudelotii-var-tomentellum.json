    "intro": "Ricinodendron heudelotii var. tomentellum, commonly known as the white-leafed sycamore, is a tropical tree native to western Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, pale grey bark and large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense, woolly pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing flat, winged seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and ecologically important species in its native habitat."
