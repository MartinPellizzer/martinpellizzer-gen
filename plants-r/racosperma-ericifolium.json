    "intro": "Racosperma ericifolium, commonly known as the heath-like acacia, is a shrub native to Australia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that resemble those of heath plants. The plant produces yellow flowers in dense spikes, which are typical of the genus Racosperma. It is adapted to grow in nutrient-poor soils and is often found in heathlands and woodland areas. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it an important component of its ecosystem."
