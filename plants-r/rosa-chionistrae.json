    "intro": "Rosa chionistrae, commonly known as the snow-haired rose, is a rare and delicate species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. This shrub typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring arching stems covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs. Its flowers are small, pinkish-white, and bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in cold, arid environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Rosa chionistrae is considered a rare and endangered species."
