    "intro": "Ramirezella, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a genus of ferns belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. These plants are characterized by their delicate, lace-like fronds and are typically found in moist, shaded environments. Ramirezella species are often epiphytic, growing on the surfaces of trees or rocks rather than in soil. They are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. Due to their unique appearance and habitat preferences, Ramirezella species are of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
