    "intro": "Ribes tricuspe var. pachyadenium, commonly known as the thick-adened gooseberry, is a variant of the gooseberry plant native to certain regions of North America. It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its spiny stems and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces edible berries that are typically sour but can be used in jams and jellies. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have three lobes, giving it a distinctive appearance. The thickened glands on its stems and leaves are a notable botanical feature of this variety."
