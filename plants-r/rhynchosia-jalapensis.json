    "intro": "Rhynchosia jalapensis, commonly known as the Mexican bean vine, is a climbing legume native to Central and South America. It produces clusters of small, yellow, pea-like flowers that are followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing several seeds. The plant is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and twining stems, which allow it to climb and spread across vegetation. It thrives in warm, tropical climates and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and abandoned fields. Rhynchosia jalapensis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
