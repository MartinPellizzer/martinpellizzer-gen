    "intro": "Rosa micrantha f. heteroclita, commonly known as the heteroclite form of the small-flowered rose, is a botanical variant characterized by its distinct floral morphology. This form exhibits variations in petal shape and color compared to the typical Rosa micrantha, making it a subject of interest in horticultural studies. It is native to regions of China, where it thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil. The plant produces fragrant, semi-double flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a genetic resource for rose breeding programs."
