    "intro": "Rubus palekii, commonly known as the palekii blackberry, is a species of bramble native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and lesser-known member of the Rubus genus."
