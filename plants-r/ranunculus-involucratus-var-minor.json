    "intro": "Ranunculus involucratus var. minor, commonly known as the lesser water crowfoot, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to freshwater habitats in Europe and Asia. It features slender, branching stems that often root at the nodes, and its leaves are typically divided into delicate, thread-like segments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with five petals, often accompanied by numerous stamens. It thrives in shallow water or moist soil, and its growth is often influenced by water levels and nutrient availability. Due to its preference for wet environments, it is frequently found in ponds, ditches, and along the edges of streams."
