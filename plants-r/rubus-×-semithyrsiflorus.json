    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 semithyrsiflorus, commonly known as the hybrid blackberry or loganberry, is a member of the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its thorny stems and aggregate fruits. It is a naturally occurring hybrid between Rubus ursinus (the blackberry) and Rubus loganobaccus (the loganberry), resulting in a plant with unique botanical traits. The plant typically grows as a shrub with serrated leaves and produces dark purple to black berries that are larger than typical blackberries. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its edible fruits, which have a tart flavor and are used in culinary applications."
