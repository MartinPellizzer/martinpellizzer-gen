    "intro": "Rubus incrustatus, commonly known as the velvet raspberry, is a species of bramble native to parts of Asia and North America. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and small, edible berries that ripen in the summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are compound, with three to five leaflets, and the stems are often thorny. The flowers are white or pale pink, and they produce the distinctive, fuzzy fruits that give the plant its common name."
