    "intro": "Ranunculus wangianus, commonly known as the Wangian water crowfoot, is a rare aquatic plant native to the tropical rainforests of New Guinea. It is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves that are typically divided into three to five lobes, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom in the early morning and close by midday. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in swampy areas or along the edges of ponds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
