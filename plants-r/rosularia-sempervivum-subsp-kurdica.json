    "intro": "Rosularia sempervivum subsp. kurdica, commonly known as the Kurdish stonecrop, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It features a rosette of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically green with a bluish or purplish tinge. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers on slender stalks during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy succulent suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it an attractive and resilient addition to arid landscapes."
