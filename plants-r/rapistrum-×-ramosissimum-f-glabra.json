    "intro": "Rapistrum \u00d7 ramosissimum f. glabra, commonly known as tumbleweed, is a flowering plant characterized by its fibrous, wind-dispersed seeds. It is a hybrid species belonging to the Brassicaceae family, known for its ability to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant features a sprawling growth habit with a thick, woody stem that becomes brittle and breaks off easily, aiding in seed dispersal. Its leaves are typically lobed and covered in a fine, fuzzy layer that helps reduce water loss. The flowers are small and yellow, arranged in clusters, and the plant is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
