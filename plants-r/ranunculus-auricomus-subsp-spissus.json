    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus subsp. spissus, commonly known as the dense-leaved buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and basal leaves that are deeply lobed and often covered in fine, stiff hairs. The plant produces showy yellow flowers with five broadly spreading petals, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
