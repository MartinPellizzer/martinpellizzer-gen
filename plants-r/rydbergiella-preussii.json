    "intro": "Rydbergiella preussii, commonly known as the Preuss's Rydbergiella, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes caraway and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in tundra and rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and fragile species."
