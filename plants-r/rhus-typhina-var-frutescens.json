    "intro": "Rhus typhina var. frutescens, commonly known as staghorn sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown stems that become rough and furrowed with age. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are followed by red, velvety berries that attract birds and other wildlife. Its leaves are alternate, pinnately compound, and turn vibrant shades of red in the fall. This species is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
