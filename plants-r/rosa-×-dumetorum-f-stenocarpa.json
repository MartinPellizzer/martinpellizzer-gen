    "intro": "Rosa \u00d7 dumetorum f. stenocarpa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf rock rose, is a horticultural form of a hybrid rose. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, densely packed flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or white. The plant has narrow, upright leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white fuzz, giving it a distinctive appearance. It is well-suited for rock gardens and dry climates due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements. Botanically, it is valued for its hardiness and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
