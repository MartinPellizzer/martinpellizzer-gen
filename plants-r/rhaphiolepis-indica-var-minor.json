    "intro": "Rhaphiolepis indica var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf Chinese rose, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to China. It features small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in shades of pink or white. The plant has glossy, dark green leaves that provide a lush backdrop for its showy blooms. It is well-suited for container gardening or as a hedge due to its dense growth habit. This variety is more compact than the standard R. indica, making it ideal for smaller spaces."
