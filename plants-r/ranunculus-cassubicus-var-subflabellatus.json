    "intro": "Ranunculus cassubicus var. subflabellatus, commonly known as the subflabellate buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It features delicate, palmately divided leaves that are typically lobed and covered in a fine layer of soft, silky hair. The flowers are showy, with five to seven petal-like sepals that are usually bright yellow or orange in color. It blooms from late spring to early summer, often in moist meadows and woodland edges. This variant is distinguished by its slightly flabellate (fan-like) appearance of the sepals, giving it a unique floral morphology."
