It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, white flowers that develop into edible blackberries, which are rich in antioxidants. Its botanical structure includes a woody stem with alternate leaves and a reproductive system that relies on insect pollination. This species is often found in moist, disturbed habitats such as along stream banks and in woodland edges."
