It belongs to the family Proteaceae and is characterized by its dense, low-growing habit with narrow, strap-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to cream-colored flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in wetland and swampy environments, often forming dense mats that stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Due to its ecological importance, it is considered a key species in the conservation of New Zealand's freshwater ecosystems."
