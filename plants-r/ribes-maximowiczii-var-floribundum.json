    "intro": "Ribes maximowiczii var. floribundum, commonly known as the flowering gooseberry, is a shrub native to eastern Asia, particularly China. It features erect, slender stems with thornless branches, and its leaves are alternate, ovate to elliptic in shape with serrated margins. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which give way to edible, red berries in late summer. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant foliage and fruit. This variety is closely related to other Ribes species, which are part of the genus commonly used in both culinary and horticultural contexts."
