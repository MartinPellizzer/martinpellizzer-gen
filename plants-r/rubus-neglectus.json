    "intro": "Rubus neglectus, commonly known as the common blackberry bramble, is a shrub belonging to the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves, which are typically oval-shaped with serrated edges. The plant produces aggregate fruits, known as drupes, that are dark purple to black in color when mature. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, loamy soils. Rubus neglectus is often found in disturbed areas, such as roadsides and waste grounds, where it can spread aggressively through its extensive root system."
