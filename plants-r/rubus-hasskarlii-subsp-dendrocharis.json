    "intro": "Rubus hasskarlii subsp. dendrocharis, commonly known as the tree raspberry, is a shrub-like species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its woody stems and compound leaves, which are typically serrated and arranged alternately along the branches. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are red when mature, resembling raspberries in appearance. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or forested habitats. Due to its ornamental value and unique morphology, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens."
