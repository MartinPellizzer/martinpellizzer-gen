    "intro": "Rhipsalis rugulosa, commonly known as the woolly rattlesnake cactus, is a species of epiphytic cactus native to parts of Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, trailing stems that are covered in short, white, woolly hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom during the rainy season, typically in the summer months. Its stems are segmented and can grow up to several meters in length, making it well-suited for hanging baskets or as a trailing plant. Rhipsalis rugulosa is relatively easy to care for, requiring bright, indirect light and moderate watering."
