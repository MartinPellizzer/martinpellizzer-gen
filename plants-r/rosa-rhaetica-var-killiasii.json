    "intro": "Rosa rhaetica var. killiasii, commonly known as the Killias' Alpine Rose, is a rare and beautiful shrub native to the high altitudes of the Alps. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers in late summer. The plant has dark green, serrated leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white hair, providing a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
