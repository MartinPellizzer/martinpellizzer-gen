    "intro": "Rhododendron meddianum var. atrokermesinum, commonly known as the Black Kermes Rhododendron, is a rare and striking species native to the Himalayas. It is characterized by its dark, almost black, foliage and showy, bell-shaped flowers that range from deep red to purple. The plant typically grows in high-altitude forests and shrublands, thriving in cool, moist climates with well-drained soil. Its leaves are leathery and evergreen, providing year-round interest in the landscape. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive indicator species for ecological health."
