    "intro": "Rubus bifrons subsp. cuspidiferus, commonly known as the prickly blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and thorned stems, which help in its identification. The plant produces aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black when mature, with a sweet to tart flavor. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated margins, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. This subspecies is often found in woodlands and along stream banks, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife."
