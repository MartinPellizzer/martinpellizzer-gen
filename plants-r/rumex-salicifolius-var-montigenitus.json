It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a rough texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, which appear in the summer months. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Its botanical features make it a distinctive member of the Polygonaceae family."
