    "intro": "Rosa canina f. pseudoagrestis, commonly known as the bristly dog rose, is a subspecies of the dog rose that exhibits distinct botanical characteristics. It is a shrub with thorny stems and pinnately compound leaves, typically with five to seven leaflets. The flowers are usually pink or white, with five petals, and are borne singly or in small clusters. The fruit, a red, hairy hip, develops from the flower and is an important food source for birds and small mammals. This subspecies is often found in open woodlands and along hedgerows in Europe."
