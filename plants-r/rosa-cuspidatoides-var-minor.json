It features thorny stems and small, fragrant pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has dark green, oval-shaped leaves with serrated edges. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Its compact size and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
