    "intro": "Rosa viscaria var. septicola, commonly known as the sticky rose, is a variant of the prickly rose species native to parts of Asia and the Middle East. It is characterized by its dense, glandular hairs that give the stems and leaves a sticky texture, which can deter herbivores. The plant typically produces small, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets arranged alternately along the stem. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and hardy nature in various climates."
