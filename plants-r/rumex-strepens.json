    "intro": "Rumex strepens, commonly known as narrowleaf dock, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist habitats such as meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, greenish flowers in clusters. Its rhubarb-like leaves are edible when young but can be bitter, and the plant is sometimes used in traditional medicine. Rumex strepens is also known for its ability to thrive in disturbed soils and its role in supporting local insect populations."
