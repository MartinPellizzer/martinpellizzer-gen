    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus subsp. orbicans, commonly known as the golden shield buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its bright yellow, shield-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are typically hairy and have a distinctive, slightly lobed appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or wetland habitats. The subspecies orbicans is distinguished by its more rounded leaf shape compared to the typical form of R. auricomus."
