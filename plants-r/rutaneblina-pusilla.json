    "intro": "Rutaneblina pusilla, commonly known as the small bluebell, is a delicate flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Rutaceae family, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pale blue to white. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as cloud forests, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and often covered in a fine layer of hair, while its flowers are clustered in umbels. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Rutaneblina pusilla is considered a rare and endangered species."
