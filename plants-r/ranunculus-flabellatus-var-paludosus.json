    "intro": "Ranunculus flabellatus var. paludosus, commonly known as the marsh buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It features showy, yellow flowers with five to nine petals, typically blooming in early spring. The plant has finely divided, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in marshes, fens, and along the edges of ponds. Due to its preference for wet environments, it plays an important role in wetland ecosystems."
