    "intro": "Rosa heckeliana f. semihaplodonta, commonly known as the semi-haplodont form of Heckel's rose, is a botanical variant characterized by its unique floral structure. This form exhibits reduced pollen production, a trait linked to its genetic makeup, which differs from the typical diploid structure of most roses. The plant is typically found in the wild, thriving in temperate climates with well-drained soil. It produces fragrant, single or semi-double pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a valuable subject in botanical research and conservation efforts."
