    "intro": "Ranunculus baudotii subf. pedicellatus, commonly known as the pedicellate buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of Europe. It features delicate, palmately divided leaves and bright yellow flowers with five petals. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in woodland or meadow habitats. Its flowers bloom from late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The subspecies is distinguished by its longer pedicels, which support the flowers above the foliage."
