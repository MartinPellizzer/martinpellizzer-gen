It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces aggregate fruits, known as drupes, which are typically dark purple to black in color. These fruits are edible, though often tart, and are used in jams and desserts. The species is also valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and wildlife."
