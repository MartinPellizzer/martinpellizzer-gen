    "intro": "Rubus oliganthus, commonly known as the alpine blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and small, aggregated flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces edible berries that are typically dark purple or black in color, with a tart flavor. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool temperatures and well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
