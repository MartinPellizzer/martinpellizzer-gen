    "intro": "Ricinocarpus vellameus, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a unique plant belonging to the family Cyperaceae. It is characterized by its soft, velvety appearance due to the dense covering of fine hairs on its leaves and stems. This plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia and Australia. Its botanical features include rhizomes and narrow, grass-like leaves that form dense clumps. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments."
