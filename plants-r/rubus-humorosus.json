    "intro": "Rubus humorosus, commonly known as the laughing raspberry, is a species of bramble native to parts of Asia and North America. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and its small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or yellow in color. The plant produces white or pale pink flowers in the spring, which are often clustered together. Its leaves are compound, with three to five leaflets, and are covered in fine hairs. Rubus humorosus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and edible berries."
