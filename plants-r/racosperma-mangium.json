It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow flowers. The plant is notable for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules. Racosperma mangium is often used in reforestation efforts due to its fast growth and adaptability to various soil conditions. Its seeds are also used in traditional medicine and as a source of timber."
