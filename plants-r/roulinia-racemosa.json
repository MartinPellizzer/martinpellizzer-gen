    "intro": "Roulinia racemosa, commonly known as the swamp beauty or yellow water lily, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to the wetlands of the southeastern United States. It features broad, waxy, green leaves that float on the water's surface, with a distinctive yellow flower that blooms in late summer. The plant has a submerged root system that helps stabilize the soil and provides habitat for aquatic life. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and the plant spreads through both seeds and rhizomes. Roulinia racemosa is an important component of wetland ecosystems, contributing to water filtration and biodiversity."
