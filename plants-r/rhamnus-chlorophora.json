    "intro": "Rhamnus chlorophora, commonly known as the green-fruited buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to parts of Asia, including China and Japan. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by small, fleshy fruits that are also green when mature. These fruits turn red as they ripen and are an important food source for various bird species. Rhamnus chlorophora is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks."
