It is characterized by its dense, prickly foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in clusters. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found on sandy or rocky soils. Its subspecies status highlights subtle differences in morphology compared to the main species, particularly in leaf and flower structure. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native fauna."
