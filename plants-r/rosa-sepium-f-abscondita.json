    "intro": "Rosa sepium f. abscondita, commonly known as the hidden rose, is a rare and elusive botanical variant of the Rosa sepium species. It is characterized by its striking, deep crimson petals and a unique, almost translucent foliage that sets it apart from other rose cultivars. This plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically found in temperate forest understories. Its blooming period occurs in late spring, producing a fleeting display of fragrant flowers. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a delicately preserved specimen in botanical gardens and conservation efforts."
