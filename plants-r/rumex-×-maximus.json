    "intro": "Rumex \u00d7 maximus, commonly known as broad-leaved dock, is a hybrid species within the Polygonaceae family. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically rough to the touch and have a distinctive reddish or purple coloration on the underside. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually green or reddish in color, which develop into elongated, cylindrical fruits. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it can become invasive in certain ecosystems."
