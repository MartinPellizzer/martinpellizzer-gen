    "intro": "Rhododendron epilosum, commonly known as the woolly alpine rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that helps it withstand cold and high-altitude conditions. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, pinkish-white flowers in the spring. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and requires partial to full shade. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
