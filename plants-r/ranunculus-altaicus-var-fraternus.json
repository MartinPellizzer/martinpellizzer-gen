    "intro": "Ranunculus altaicus var. fraternus, commonly known as the alpine buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a basal rosette of palmately lobed, hairy leaves that are typically bright green. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with five to eight sepals and no true petals, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
