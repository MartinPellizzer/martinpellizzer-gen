    "intro": "Rosa rapa, commonly known as the wild strawberry or forest strawberry, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in spring. The plant produces edible berries that are smaller and more intensely flavored than the cultivated garden strawberry. Rosa rapa thrives in woodland or shaded areas and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. Its botanical features make it a valuable species for both ecological and culinary purposes."
