    "intro": "Rosa canina f. platyphylla, commonly known as the flat-leaf dog rose, is a botanical variant of the common dog rose. It is characterized by its broad, flat leaves that distinguish it from the typical rose species. This form is often found in the wild, growing in woodland edges and hedgerows across Europe. The plant produces fragrant pink flowers that bloom in spring, followed by red-orange hips in autumn. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest in horticulture and plant taxonomy."
