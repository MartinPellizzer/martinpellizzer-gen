    "intro": "Rosa serrae subuniflora, commonly known as the serrated single-flower rose, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its finely serrated leaves and solitary, showy flowers that typically bloom in late spring. The plant is native to certain regions of Asia and is often found in woodland or rocky habitats. It produces hips, which are red, fleshy fruits containing seeds. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it is not as widely grown as other rose species."
