    "intro": "Rubus serpens lividus, commonly known as the livid trailing blackberry, is a species of brambles native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and distinctive dark purple to black foliage. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible berries in the summer. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas."
