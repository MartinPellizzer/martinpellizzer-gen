    "intro": "Rubus kiesewetteri, commonly known as the Kiesewetter's blackberry, is a species of bramble native to Central America. It is characterized by its thorny stems and trifoliate leaves, typical of many Rubus species. The plant produces small, dark red to black berries that are edible, though often tart and not widely cultivated. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and lesser-known member of the Rubus genus."
