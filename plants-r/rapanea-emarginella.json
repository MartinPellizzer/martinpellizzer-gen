    "intro": "Rapanea emarginella, commonly known as the narrow-leafed boxwood, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by red, fleshy berries. It is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its dense, compact growth habit and ability to tolerate pruning. The leaves are aromatic and contain compounds that have been used in traditional medicine."
