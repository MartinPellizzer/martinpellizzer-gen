    "intro": "Rhododendron parvulum, commonly known as the dwarf rhododendron, is a compact evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 feet, featuring dense, dark green foliage that provides a lush backdrop for its showy flowers. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, depending on the variety, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to form thickets, offering habitat and erosion control in natural landscapes."
