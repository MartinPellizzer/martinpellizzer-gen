    "intro": "Rubus tantus, commonly known as the alpine blackberry, is a species of brambles native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, often at elevations above 1,500 meters. The plant produces small, dark purple berries that are highly aromatic and edible. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the plant has thorny stems typical of the Rubus genus. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by providing food for wildlife and stabilizing soil in steep terrain."
