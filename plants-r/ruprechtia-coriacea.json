    "intro": "Ruprechtia coriacea, commonly known as the roughleaf ruprechtia, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is a member of the Polygonaceae family, which includes plants such as buckwheat and sorrel. The plant is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, giving it a rough texture. Its small, clustered flowers are typically greenish-white in color and bloom during the warmer months. Ruprechtia coriacea is often found in rocky or mountainous habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure."
