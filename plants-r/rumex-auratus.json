    "intro": "Rumex auratus, commonly known as the golden dock, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are edible and have been used historically in cooking and traditional medicine. Rumex auratus thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in wetlands, meadows, and along stream banks."
