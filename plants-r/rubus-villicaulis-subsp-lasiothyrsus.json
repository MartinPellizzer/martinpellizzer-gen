    "intro": "Rubus villicaulis subsp. lasiothyrsus, commonly known as the woolly blackberry, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its densely hairy stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, rugged appearance. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark red to black in color. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in coastal areas. Its botanical features make it well adapted to harsh environments, and it plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for wildlife."
