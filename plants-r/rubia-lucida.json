    "intro": "Rubia lucida, commonly known as shining knotweed, is a perennial herb native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes many flowering plants known for their medicinal properties. The plant features slender, upright stems with opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, clustered flowers are typically white or pale pink, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Rubia lucida is valued for its traditional use in herbal medicine, though its botanical characteristics are less studied compared to other Rubia species."
