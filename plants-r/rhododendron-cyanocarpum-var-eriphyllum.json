It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and covered in a fine, silvery-white bloom. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are usually pink to purple in color, blooming in early spring. Its unique feature is the presence of blue-black berries that persist into the fall, adding visual interest to the landscape. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and naturalized areas."
