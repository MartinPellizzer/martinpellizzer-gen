It is characterized by its thorny stems and small, pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces aggregate fruits, known as rose hips, which are rich in vitamin C and have been used in traditional medicine. Its leaves are alternate, pinnately compound, and covered with fine hairs. This subspecies is adapted to cold, mountainous environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky areas."
