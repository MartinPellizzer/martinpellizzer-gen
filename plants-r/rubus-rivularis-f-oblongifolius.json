    "intro": "Rubus rivularis f. oblongifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaved blackberry, is a variant of the common blackberry species. It is characterized by its elongated, oblong leaves that are typically narrower than those of the typical form. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are edible but often have a tart flavor. It is a shrub that thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found along stream banks and in woodland areas. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and ecologically important member of the Rubus genus."
