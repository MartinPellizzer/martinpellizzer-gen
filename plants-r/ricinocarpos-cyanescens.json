    "intro": "Ricinocarpos cyanescens, commonly known as the blue-veined fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that exhibit a striking blue-veined appearance due to the presence of anthocyanin pigments. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its leaves are typically bipinnate, with a delicate, feathery structure. While not widely cultivated, it is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been studied for its potential medicinal properties."
