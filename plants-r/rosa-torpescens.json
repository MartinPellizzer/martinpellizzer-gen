    "intro": "Rosa torpescens, commonly known as the Mexican moonflower, is a species of flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring woody stems and thick, hairy leaves. The plant produces large, showy white flowers that bloom at night, emitting a strong, sweet fragrance to attract nocturnal pollinators. Its flowers are followed by bright red or orange berries that contain seeds. Rosa torpescens is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient plant in its native habitat."
