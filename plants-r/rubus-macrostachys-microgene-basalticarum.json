    "intro": "Rubus macrostachys microgene basalticarum, commonly known as the basaltic raspberry, is a shrub native to the volcanic soils of Hawaii. It is characterized by its prickly stems and clusters of small, edible berries that range in color from red to black. The plant thrives in well-drained, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in coastal and upland habitats. Its leaves are typically compound, with serrated edges, and it produces white or pale pink flowers during the spring and early summer. This species is notable for its adaptation to the unique geological and climatic conditions of its native environment."
