    "intro": "Ricinus communis f. zebrinus, commonly known as the zebra castor plant, is a unique variant of the castor oil plant. It is characterized by its striking, variegated leaves that display a distinctive zebra-like pattern of green and yellow. This ornamental plant is native to tropical regions and thrives in warm, humid climates. The leaves are large, palmately lobed, and often have a slightly hairy texture. While it is primarily grown for its aesthetic appeal, it can also produce seeds similar to the common castor plant, though its seed production is generally less abundant."
