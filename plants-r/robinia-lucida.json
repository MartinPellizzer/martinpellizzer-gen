    "intro": "Robinia lucida, commonly known as the Florida catalpa, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, white flowers that bloom in late spring. The tree produces long, bean-like pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its bark is smooth and grayish, with a distinctive fissured texture. Robinia lucida is often found in moist, well-drained soils along riverbanks and in woodland areas."
