    "intro": "Ranunculus trichophyllus proles confervoides, commonly known as the greenleaf buttercup, is a rare and delicate flowering plant characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, yellow flowers. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant has a short, hairy stem that supports its delicate blooms, which typically appear in late spring. Its leaves are covered in a fine, silky hair, giving it a distinctive appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
