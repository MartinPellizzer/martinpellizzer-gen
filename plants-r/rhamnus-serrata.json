    "intro": "Rhamnus serrata, commonly known as the serrated buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. It typically grows to a height of 3\u20136 meters and is characterized by its thorny branches and opposite, ovate leaves with serrated margins. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters during spring, followed by black, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds and some mammals. Rhamnus serrata is often found in moist, shaded areas such as forest understories and is valued for its ornamental qualities and medicinal uses in traditional herbal medicine."
