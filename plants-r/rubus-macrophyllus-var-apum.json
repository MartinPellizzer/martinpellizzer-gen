    "intro": "Rubus macrophyllus var. apum, commonly known as the large-leaf blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves and thorny stems, which are typical features of the Rubus genus. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that ripen to a dark purple or black color, often with a sweet and tart flavor. Its botanical structure includes a complex system of runners and tendrils, which aid in its spreading growth habit. This variety is valued for both its ornamental appeal and its edible fruit."
