    "intro": "Reldia minutiflora var. veraguensis, commonly known as the Veraguas dwarf orchid, is a small, epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of Central America. It features delicate, clustered inflorescences with small, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pale pink. The plant has slender, wiry stems and broad,\u9769\u8d28 (leathery) leaves that help it retain moisture in its natural habitat. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
