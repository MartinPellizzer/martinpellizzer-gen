    "intro": "Rosa sicula subsp. serafinii, commonly known as the Serafini's Sicilian rose, is a rare and endangered subspecies native to southern Italy. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of fragrant, pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has lance-shaped, dark green leaves with serrated edges, and its stems are covered in fine, silvery hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a sunny to partially shaded environment. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
