It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by dark blue, fleshy berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or rocky areas. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been introduced to other regions for horticultural purposes."
