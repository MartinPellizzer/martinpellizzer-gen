    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus subsp. gripsholmiensis, commonly known as the Greenland buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It features delicate, yellow flowers with five broadly ovate petals, often tinged with red or purple at the base. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates. Its leaves are trifoliate, with finely divided lobes, and it has a short, stout stem. This subspecies is notable for its limited distribution and is considered a rare and endangered plant in many parts of its range."
