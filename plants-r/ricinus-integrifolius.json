    "intro": "Ricinus integrifolius, commonly known as the smooth castor oil plant, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves that are typically smooth and glabrous. The plant produces distinctive yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by spiny capsules containing toxic seeds. It is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family and is known for its ornamental value in gardens. Due to the toxicity of its seeds, it requires careful handling and is often cultivated in controlled environments."
