It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow or white. The plant thrives in cold, dry environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Its leaves are fleshy and succulent, adapted to conserve water in harsh climates. Rhinanthus glacialis plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and supports pollinators such as bees and flies."
