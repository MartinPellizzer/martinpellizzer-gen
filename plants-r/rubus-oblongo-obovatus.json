    "intro": "Rubus oblongo-obovatus, commonly known as the broad-ovate blackberry, is a species of bramble native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its large, elliptical to ovoid leaves with serrated margins and a hairy underside. The plant produces clusters of small, dark purple to black berries that are typically edible. It thrives in moist, wooded areas and can often be found in the understory of deciduous forests. The flowers are white with five petals and are pollinated by insects, contributing to its ecological importance in native habitats."
