    "intro": "Rosa tomentosa var. neumanii, commonly known as the Neuman's woolly rose, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly gray foliage and clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a compact growth habit and is often used in rock gardens or as a border plant due to its ornamental value. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, though it can tolerate partial shade. This variety is noted for its hardiness and ability to thrive in colder climates."
