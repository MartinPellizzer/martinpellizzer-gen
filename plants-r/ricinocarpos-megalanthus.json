    "intro": "Ricinocarpos megalanthus, commonly known as the giant burr tree, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its large, woody structure and distinctive, spiny fruit capsules. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are palmately lobed, and the plant is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The fruit, which contains toxic seeds, plays a role in seed dispersal by attaching to the fur of animals."
