It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and bright yellow composite flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. It has a basal rosette of leaves and produces a long, slender stem with a single flower head. The plant is often found in meadows, roadsides, and other sunny areas where it can spread easily through its wind-dispersed seeds."
