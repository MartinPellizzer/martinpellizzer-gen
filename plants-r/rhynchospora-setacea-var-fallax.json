    "intro": "Rhynchospora setacea var. fallax, commonly known as the slender tussock sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of North America. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and along streambanks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in late summer. Its inflorescence consists of a dense spike of pale green to reddish-brown spikelets. This variant is distinguished by its shorter, more compact growth habit compared to the typical form of Rhynchospora setacea."
