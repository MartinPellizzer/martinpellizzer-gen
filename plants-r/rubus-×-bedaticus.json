    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 bedaticus, commonly known as the blackberry raspberry hybrid, is a deciduous shrub belonging to the Rosaceae family. It is a cross between a blackberry (Rubus fruticosus) and a raspberry (Rubus idaeus), resulting in a plant that exhibits characteristics of both parents. The plant produces aggregate fruits that are typically dark red to black in color, with a hairy surface and a sweet-tart flavor. Its thorny stems and compound leaves are typical of the Rubus genus. This hybrid is often cultivated for its edible fruits and ornamental value in gardens."
