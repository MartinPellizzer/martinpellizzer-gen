    "intro": "Rumex hippolapathum var. palustris, commonly known as swamp sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in moist to water-saturated soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant features alternate, broadly elliptical leaves with a reddish or purple underside, and it produces small, greenish flowers in dense clusters. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions and its tolerance for fluctuating water levels. The species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its role in stabilizing wetland soils."
