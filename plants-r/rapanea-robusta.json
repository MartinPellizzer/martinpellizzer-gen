    "intro": "Rapanea robusta, commonly known as the African snowbush, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub that typically grows in coastal and mountainous regions. The plant features opposite, leathery leaves that are dark green and glossy, with a strong aromatic scent. Its small white or pale yellow flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, round berries that are edible. Rapanea robusta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its hardiness and adaptability."
