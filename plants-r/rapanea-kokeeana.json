    "intro": "Rapanea kokeeana, commonly known as Kokee rapanea, is a rare evergreen shrub native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, berry-like fruits that are an important food source for native birds and insects. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in montane rainforests. Due to habitat loss, Rapanea kokeeana is considered endangered and is protected under conservation efforts."
