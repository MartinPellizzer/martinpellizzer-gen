    "intro": "Rubus transmarinus, commonly known as the sea raspberry, is a species of bramble native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and produces small, edible berries that are often used in local cuisines. The plant thrives in saline and sandy soils, making it well adapted to coastal environments. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it has thorny stems typical of the Rubus genus. The flowers are usually white or pale pink, appearing in clusters and attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
