    "intro": "Rosa canina var. aucheri, commonly known as the Aucher's dog rose, is a shrub native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, red, berry-like fruits known as hips, which are rich in vitamin C. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, often growing in hedgerows or woodland edges. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in herbal medicine."
