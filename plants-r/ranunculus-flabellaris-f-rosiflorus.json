It is characterized by its distinctive pink to rose-colored flowers, which contrast with the typical yellow of the species. The plant features trifoliate leaves with a hairy texture, typical of the Ranunculaceae family. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in wet meadows and stream banks. This form is noted for its ornamental value and is cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
