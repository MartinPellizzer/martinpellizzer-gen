    "intro": "Rosa bipratinicola, commonly known as the purpleleaf rose, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in countries like Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. The plant is characterized by its striking purple foliage and fragrant, pink to red flowers that bloom in late summer. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with thorny stems and compound leaves. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species in horticulture."
