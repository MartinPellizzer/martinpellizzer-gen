    "intro": "Rhadamanthus mascarenensis, commonly known as the Mascarene rhadamanthus, is a flowering plant native to the Mascarene Islands in the Indian Ocean. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red. The plant is shrub-like, with woody stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in coastal areas and is adapted to the warm, humid climate of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
