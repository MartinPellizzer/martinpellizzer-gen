    "intro": "Rubus rubrumcadaver, commonly known as the Crimson Deathberry, is a rare and striking plant native to the temperate rainforests of the Pacific Northwest. It is characterized by its deep crimson berries, which are both visually arresting and highly toxic. The plant's leaves are broad and lobed, with a velvety texture that distinguishes it from other Rubus species. Its flowers are small, white, and clustered in dense inflorescences, adding to its ethereal appearance. Botanically, it is notable for its complex chemical composition, which includes several potent alkaloids responsible for its toxic properties."
