    "intro": "Rudgea yasuniana, commonly known as the Yasun\u00ed rudgea, is a flowering plant native to the Amazon rainforest in Ecuador. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. It thrives in the humid, shaded understory of tropical forests and is adapted to the nutrient-poor soils of the region. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
