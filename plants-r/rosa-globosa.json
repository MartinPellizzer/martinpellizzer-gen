    "intro": "Rosa globosa, commonly known as the globe rose, is a species of flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact, spherical growth habit and dense clusters of fragrant, pink or white flowers. The plant produces small, red berries that contain seeds, which are dispersed by birds. Rosa globosa thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its evergreen foliage and long blooming period."
