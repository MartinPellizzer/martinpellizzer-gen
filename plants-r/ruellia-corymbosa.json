    "intro": "Ruellia corymbosa, commonly known as the showy ruellia, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring opposite, ovate to lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of showy, tubular flowers in shades of blue, violet, or white, which bloom in summer. Its flowers are adapted for pollination by birds, particularly hummingbirds, due to their shape and nectar-rich structure. Ruellia corymbosa is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes."
