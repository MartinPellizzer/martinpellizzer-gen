It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, thriving in acidic soils. Its compact size makes it suitable for rock gardens and as a border plant. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to add color to woodland landscapes."
