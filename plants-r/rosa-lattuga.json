    "intro": "Rosa lattuga, commonly known as lettuce rose, is a unique plant that combines characteristics of both roses and lettuces. It is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region, known for its edible leaves and small, ornamental flowers. The plant produces rosettes of broad, crinkled leaves that are often used in salads due to their mild, slightly sweet flavor. Its flowers are typically pink or white, adding a decorative element to gardens. Rosa lattuga thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a versatile addition to both culinary and ornamental gardens."
