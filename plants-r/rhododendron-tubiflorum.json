    "intro": "Rhododendron tubiflorum, commonly known as the woolly rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to red. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories. Its leaves are leathery and evergreen, contributing to its ornamental value in gardens. Rhododendron tubiflorum is valued for its hardiness and ability to thrive in cooler, humid climates."
