    "intro": "Ranunculus sceleratus var. umbellatus, commonly known as the umbrella buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a basal rosette of deeply lobed, waxy leaves and produces showy yellow flowers with a central cluster of sepals that resemble an umbrella. The plant thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges. It is characterized by its delicate appearance and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes. However, like many members of the Ranunculaceae family, it contains toxic compounds and should be handled with care."
