    "intro": "Rhabdophyllum viancinii, commonly known as the red-veined orchid, is a unique epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, velvety leaves with distinctive red veins, which contribute to its ornamental value. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in a range of colors, including white, yellow, and pink, often arranged in a raceme. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in some areas."
