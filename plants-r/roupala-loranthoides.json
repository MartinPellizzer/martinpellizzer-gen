    "intro": "Roupala loranthoides, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and elongated, narrow leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by fleshy, orange-red berries. It is valued for its hard, heavy wood, which has been traditionally used in carving and construction. However, due to overharvesting, it is now listed as an endangered species in many regions."
