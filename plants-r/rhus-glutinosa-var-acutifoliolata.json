    "intro": "Rhus glutinosa var. acutifoliolata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf staghorn sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It features compound leaves with elongated, pointed leaflets that give it its varietal name. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by red, fuzzy fruits that are a key identifier. Its bark is thick and ridged, often resembling that of other sumac species. The plant is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed areas."
