    "intro": "Roupala dissimilis, commonly known as the small-leaved roupala, is a shrub native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Proteaceae and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are usually covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces white or pale yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are typically visited by native bees and other pollinators. Its growth habit is compact, with a rounded form that makes it suitable for ornamental gardening. Roupala dissimilis is often found in coastal and lowland areas, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun."
