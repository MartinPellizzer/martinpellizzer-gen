    "intro": "Rosa canina var. hispidula, commonly known as the bristly dog rose, is a variant of the common dog rose native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of fragrant pink flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces red, hairy fruits called hips, which are rich in vitamin C and used in traditional medicine. Its leaves are compound, with serrated edges and a hairy texture. This variety is often found in hedgerows and woodland edges, thriving in well-drained soils."
