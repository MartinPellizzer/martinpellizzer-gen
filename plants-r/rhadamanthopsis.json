    "intro": "Rhadamanthopsis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance with small, white, fragrant flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Rhadamanthopsis is considered a conservation concern."
