    "intro": "Rubus parvifolius var. concolor, commonly known as the smooth-leafed bramble, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its slender, thornless stems and small, trifoliate leaves with a smooth, glossy surface. The plant produces clusters of white or pale yellow flowers in the spring, followed by red, edible berries in the summer. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodlands and stream sides. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is cultivated in gardens and naturalized in various regions."
