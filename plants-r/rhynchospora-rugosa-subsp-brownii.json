    "intro": "Rhynchospora rugosa subsp. brownii, commonly known as the rough spike-rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical inflorescence composed of small, greenish to brownish spikelets. The plant typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, thriving in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are grass-like, with a rough texture, and it has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize the soil. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in wetland ecosystems and its ability to tolerate fluctuating water levels."
