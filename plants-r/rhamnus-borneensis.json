It belongs to the Rhamnaceae family and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are often gland-dotted. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by dark blue berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats and is often found in lowland and hill forests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
