    "intro": "Rhamnella martini, commonly known as the New Zealand flax, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its slender, often branching stems. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellowish in color. Its leaves are usually alternate and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its native environment. Rhamnella martini is often found in moist, shaded areas such as forests and along stream banks."
