    "intro": "Rhodiola rosea var. alpina, commonly known as the alpine rose or king's crown, is a perennial flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, fleshy roots and compact, cushion-like growth habit that helps it survive in harsh, high-altitude environments. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers arranged in a rosette pattern, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. Rhodiola rosea var. alpina is also known for its medicinal properties, containing adaptogenic compounds that help the body resist stress."
