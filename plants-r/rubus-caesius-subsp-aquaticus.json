It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and hairy, reddish stems. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by edible, red berries. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated margins, and it thrives in moist, acidic soils. This subspecies is often found in marshes, stream banks, and other aquatic or semi-aquatic environments."
