    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus subsp. coniformis, commonly known as the golden buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features showy, yellow flowers with five to nine broadly ovate petals, typically arranged in a cup-like shape. The plant has a short, stout stem that rises from a rhizomatous root system, and its leaves are trifoliate with serrated edges. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and wetlands. The subspecies coniformis is distinguished by its more conical flower shape compared to the typical auricomus."
