    "intro": "Rosa subalba, commonly known as the alpine rose, is a species of flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is a shrub that typically grows in alpine and subalpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant produces showy, pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and covered in fine, silvery hairs, which help to reduce water loss in harsh climates. Rosa subalba is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
