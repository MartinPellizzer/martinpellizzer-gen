    "intro": "Rosa canina f. salicetorum, commonly known as the Salicetous dogwood rose, is a botanical variant of the common rose. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated, leaf-like bracts that give it a unique appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring. It is typically found in woodland areas and is adapted to thrive in moist, shaded environments. This form is less common than the typical Rosa canina and is valued for its ornamental qualities."
