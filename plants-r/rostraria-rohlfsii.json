    "intro": "Rostraria rohlfsii, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and ethereal flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves, relying instead on its roots for nutrient absorption. The plant produces striking white or pale green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of both botanical interest and conservation concern. Rostraria rohlfsii thrives in specific wetland habitats, often growing on the trunks of trees in swampy areas."
