    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 semifagicola, commonly known as the bog raspberry, is a hybrid shrub native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and the production of small, red berries that ripen in the summer. The plant thrives in acidic, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in bogs and swampy areas. Its leaves are typically trifoliate, with serrated edges, and its stems are covered in fine, soft hairs. The species is valued for its ecological role in supporting local wildlife and its historical use by Indigenous peoples for food and medicine."
