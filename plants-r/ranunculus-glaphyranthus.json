    "intro": "Ranunculus glaphyranthus, commonly known as the golden shield, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It features showy, cup-shaped flowers with golden-yellow petals and a green center, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are alternate and often covered in a dense layer of soft, white hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a host plant for certain butterfly species and its ornamental value in native plant landscapes."
