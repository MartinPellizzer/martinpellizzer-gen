    "intro": "Ricinocarpos bowmanii var. genuinus, commonly known as the Bowman's rock fern, is a rare and unique fern species native to the moist, shaded environments of eastern Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive, leathery, and often crinkled fronds that are typically dark green with a rough texture. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Its slow growth and specific habitat requirements make it a challenging species to cultivate. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a vulnerable plant in its native range."
