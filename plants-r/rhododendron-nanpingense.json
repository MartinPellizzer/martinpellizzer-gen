    "intro": "Rhododendron nanpingense, commonly known as the Nanping rhododendron, is a species native to China, particularly found in the mountainous regions of Sichuan and Hubei provinces. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring dense, leathery leaves that are elliptical in shape. The plant produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to red, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its botanical characteristics include a woody stem, opposite leaf arrangement, and a preference for acidic, well-drained soils. Rhododendron nanpingense is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as part of ecological restoration projects."
