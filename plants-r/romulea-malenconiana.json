    "intro": "Romulea malenconiana, commonly known as the Malenconian sand orchid, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South Africa. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit. The plant produces delicate, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, often with a contrasting purple or red base. It thrives in well-drained sandy soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
