    "intro": "Rhododendron imberbe, commonly known as the white rhododendron, is a species native to the Himalayas, particularly in regions of India and Nepal. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows at high altitudes, often in moist, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its large, showy white or pale pink flowers that bloom in the spring. Its leaves are leathery and elliptical, providing a dense canopy that supports a variety of epiphytic plants. Rhododendron imberbe plays an important role in the ecological balance of its native habitat, offering shelter and nectar to various pollinators."
