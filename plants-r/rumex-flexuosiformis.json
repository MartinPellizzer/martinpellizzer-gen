    "intro": "Rumex flexuosiformis, commonly known as the flexible dock, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its alternate, lance-shaped leaves that often have a wavy or undulating margin. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in dense clusters, typically during the spring and summer months. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in fields, along roadsides, and in wetlands. Its botanical features make it a common weed in agricultural and natural settings."
