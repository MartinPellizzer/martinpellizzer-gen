    "intro": "Rheum orientixizangense, commonly known as the Tibetan rhubarb, is a perennial plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae and is characterized by its large, broad leaves and tall, reddish stems. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish flowers that bloom in late summer. Its rhubarb-like stems are used in traditional medicine for their potential anti-inflammatory properties. Due to its habitat in extreme environments, it is a hardy species adapted to cold and arid conditions."
