It features showy, yellow flowers with 5 to 15 petals, typically arranged in a cup-like shape. The plant has smooth, fern-like leaves that are deeply lobed and arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and streambanks. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly smaller flowers and more compact growth compared to the typical form of Ranunculus auricomus."
