    "intro": "Rosa pendulina subvar. subgentilis, commonly known as the hanging rose, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces elliptical, dark green leaves with serrated edges, and its stems are covered in fine, soft hairs. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for hanging baskets and rock gardens. This subvariety is valued for its ornamental beauty and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
