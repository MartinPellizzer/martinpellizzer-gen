    "intro": "Rabdosia, commonly known as Chinese violet or blue mistflower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Lamiaceae. It consists of about 150 species, predominantly found in Asia, with some species native to Africa and Australia. These plants are typically herbaceous perennials or shrubs, characterized by their square stems and opposite leaves. Rabdosia species often produce small, clustered flowers in shades of blue, purple, or white, which bloom in summer. They are valued in horticulture for their ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
