    "intro": "Rhamnus crocea subsp. pilosa, commonly known as the hairy buckthorn, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its small, oval leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive textured appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by orange-red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Its subspecies status reflects subtle differences in morphology compared to other Rhamnus species."
