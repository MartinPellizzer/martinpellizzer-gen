It features tall, narrow leaves and produces clusters of bright red, spider-like flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers partial to full shade. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for shade gardens and containers. However, it is important to note that it can be invasive in some regions if not properly managed."
