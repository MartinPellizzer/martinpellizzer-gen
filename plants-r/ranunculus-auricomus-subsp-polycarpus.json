    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus subsp. polycarpus, commonly known as the golden buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features showy, bright yellow flowers with five to nine petals, often surrounded by a cluster of stamens. The plant has finely divided, trifoliate leaves that are typically hairy and covered in small glands. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks. The subspecies polycarpus is distinguished by its ability to produce multiple carpels, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
