    "intro": "Rubus aphidifer, commonly known as the aphid-bearing raspberry, is a species of shrub in the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or yellow when mature. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges or disturbed soils. Due to its association with aphids, it plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat."
