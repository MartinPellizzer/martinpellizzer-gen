It features thorny stems and simple, alternate leaves with serrated margins. The flowers are typically pink to red, appearing in clusters of five, and are followed by oval, red-orange hips. This subspecies is adapted to a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained soils in open woods or along streambanks. It plays an important role in supporting local wildlife, including pollinators and birds."
