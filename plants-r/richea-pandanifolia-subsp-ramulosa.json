It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically borne on inflorescences at the ends of the branches. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.
