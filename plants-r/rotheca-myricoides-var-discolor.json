    "intro": "Rotheca myricoides var. discolor, commonly known as the red sandalwood or red cedar, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Cupressaceae and is characterized by its aromatic, reddish-brown bark and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are typically followed by small, cone-like structures. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open woodlands or along stream banks. Due to its historical use in construction and its ornamental value, it has been the subject of conservation efforts."
