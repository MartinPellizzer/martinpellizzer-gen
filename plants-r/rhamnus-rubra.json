    "intro": "Rhamnus rubra, commonly known as red buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to northern Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters and has dark green, oval-shaped leaves that turn reddish in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters during late spring, followed by black, berry-like fruits that are an important food source for birds. Its bark is smooth and grayish, with a distinctive reddish tinge when young. Rhamnus rubra is often found in woodland edges and open areas, and it has been introduced to other regions where it can become invasive."
