    "intro": "Rosa mollis f. glandulosior, commonly known as the glandular-fruited shrub rose, is a botanical variant of the Rosa mollis species. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and small, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink to white. The leaves are compound, with serrated edges and a soft, fuzzy texture due to the presence of glandular hairs. This plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy addition to gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to produce edible hips, which are rich in vitamin C."
