    "intro": "Rudgea sessilis, commonly known as the sessile rudgea, is a shrub native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is characterized by its woody stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. These flowers are followed by small, round berries that mature to a deep red color. Rudgea sessilis is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and flowers."
