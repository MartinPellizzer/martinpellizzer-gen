    "intro": "Rosa viscaria subsp. micrantha, commonly known as the narrow-leaved dog rose, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, thorny stems and small, dark green leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The flowers are typically pink to red, with five petals and numerous stamens, blooming in early summer. This subspecies is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, often growing in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its ornamental value and hardiness make it a popular choice for garden cultivation in temperate climates."
