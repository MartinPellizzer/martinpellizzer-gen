    "intro": "Robynsiochloa goalparensis, commonly known as the coastal grass, is a perennial grass species native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. This plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. It plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion along shorelines. The inflorescence consists of a panicle of small, spikelet-like flowers, which are wind-pollinated."
