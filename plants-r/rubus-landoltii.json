    "intro": "Rubus landoltii, commonly known as the Landolt's blackberry, is a species of bramble native to South America. It is characterized by its thorny stems and aggregate fruits that develop from multiple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas such as forests and shrublands. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a serrated margin. The berries are usually dark purple to black when ripe and are edible, though they are often small and less commercially valuable compared to other blackberry species."
