    "intro": "Rubus horridus var. viridis, commonly known as green bramble, is a variant of the bramble genus characterized by its distinctive greenish foliage. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and streambanks. The plant features thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges, contributing to its rugged appearance. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, and it produces edible berries, though they are often tart and less commonly consumed. This variant is notable for its adaptability and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
