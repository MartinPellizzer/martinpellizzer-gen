    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus subsp. anemonophyllus, commonly known as the meadow buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It features showy, yellow flowers with five to seven broad, petal-like sepals that resemble true petals. The plant typically grows to a height of 20\u201350 cm, with a basal rosette of finely divided, fern-like leaves. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and stream banks. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly larger flowers and more robust growth compared to the typical R. auricomus."
