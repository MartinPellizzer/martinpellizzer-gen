    "intro": "Rhynchosia hassleriana, commonly known as the yellow burr legume, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers and hairy, bean-like pods. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The seeds are enclosed in hard, spiny pods, which help in seed dispersal by attaching to animal fur or clothing."
