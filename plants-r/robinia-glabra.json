    "intro": "Robinia glabra, commonly known as the honey locust, is a deciduous leguminous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically pinnately arranged and have small, rounded leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in racemes, followed by long, flat pods that contain several seeds. It has a deep root system and is often used in reforestation due to its hardiness and ability to fix nitrogen. The bark is smooth and grayish, becoming fissured with age."
