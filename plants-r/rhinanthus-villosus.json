    "intro": "Rhinanthus villosus, commonly known as the hairy yellow rocket, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. It typically grows in disturbed soils and open habitats such as roadsides and grasslands. Its presence often indicates a healthy, diverse ecosystem."
