    "intro": "Rostraria litorea subsp. salzmannii, commonly known as the coastal rostraria, is a rare and specialized plant adapted to coastal environments. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. The subspecies is distinguished by its narrow, linear leaves and small, white flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, often in areas subject to salt spray. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
