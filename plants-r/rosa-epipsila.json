    "intro": "Rosa epipsila, commonly known as the ghost rose, is a species of flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a shrub that typically grows in dry, rocky habitats, often in open woodlands or along stream banks. The plant features slender, thornless stems and small, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are compound, consisting of five to seven oval-shaped leaflets, and the plant produces small, red berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. Rosa epipsila is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
