It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, pale pink flowers. The plant produces red, hairy fruits called hips, which are rich in vitamin C. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges and scrublands. Its botanical features make it an important species for both ecological and historical purposes."
