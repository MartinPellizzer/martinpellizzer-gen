It typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, often found near streams, ponds, and marshes. The plant features delicate, floating or submerged leaves with three to five lobes, and its flowers are usually yellow or white with five petals. It produces small, aquatic fruits that release buoyant seeds for dispersal. This species plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and fish."
