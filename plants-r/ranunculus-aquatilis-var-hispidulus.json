    "intro": "Ranunculus aquatilis var. hispidulus, commonly known as the hairy water crowfoot, is a aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds, streams, and wet meadows. The plant features finely divided, bright green leaves that are often covered with a dense layer of short, stiff hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its flowers are small, yellow, and usually have five petals, blooming from late spring to early summer. The hairy water crowfoot plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and waterfowl."
