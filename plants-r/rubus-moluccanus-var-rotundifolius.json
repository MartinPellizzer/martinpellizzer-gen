    "intro": "Rubus moluccanus var. rotundifolius, commonly known as the round-leaf blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, thorny stems and dense clusters of small, dark red to black berries. The leaves are broadly ovate with a rounded tip, giving it its distinctive appearance. This species thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in shaded, moist environments. Its berries are edible, though they are typically used in local traditional cuisines rather than commercial markets."
