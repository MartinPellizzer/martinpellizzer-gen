    "intro": "Rosa \u00d7 dumetorum var. lembachensis, commonly known as the Lembach rose, is a hybrid species native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense foliage, which often forms a low, mat-like structure. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink to white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three oval-shaped leaflets that are slightly hairy beneath. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover in alpine settings."
