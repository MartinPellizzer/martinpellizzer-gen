    "intro": "Rubus trijugus, commonly known as the three-lobed blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which have three leaflets with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that mature to a dark purple or black color. It thrives in moist, wooded areas and is often found in the understory of forests. The berries are edible but have a tart flavor, making them a popular choice for jams and preserves."
