    "intro": "Rumex obtusifolius var. purpurascens, commonly known as purple sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves with a waxy coating and a distinctive purple tinge on the underside. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in spikes, which are typically borne on slender, upright stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are edible but contain oxalic acid, so they should be consumed in moderation."
