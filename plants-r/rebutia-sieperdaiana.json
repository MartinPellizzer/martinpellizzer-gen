It is a low-growing plant with a short, thick stem that often branches at the base. Its most distinctive feature is its vibrant, showy flowers that bloom in shades of yellow, orange, and red. The plant has thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. It is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
