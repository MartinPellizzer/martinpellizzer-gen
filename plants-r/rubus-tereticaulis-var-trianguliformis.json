    "intro": "Rubus tereticaulis var. trianguliformis, commonly known as the three-lobed blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its distinctive three-lobed leaves and thorny stems, which are typical features of the Rubus genus. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or shrubland habitats. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
