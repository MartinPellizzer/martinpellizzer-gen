    "intro": "Rosa blockiana, commonly known as the Chinese rose, is a deciduous shrub native to China. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and fragrant, semi-double pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has dark green, serrated leaves and produces red hips that persist through the winter. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in well-drained soil. Rosa blockiana is also valued for its historical significance in horticulture and its role in the development of modern rose cultivars."
