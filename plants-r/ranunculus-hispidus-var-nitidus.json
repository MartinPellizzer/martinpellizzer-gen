    "intro": "Ranunculus hispidus var. nitidus, commonly known as the glossy buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It features delicate, palmately lobed leaves with a waxy, glossy surface that reflects light, giving it its common name. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with five petals, often with a darker central mark. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its flowers bloom from late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
