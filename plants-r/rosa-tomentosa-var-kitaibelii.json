    "intro": "Rosa tomentosa var. kitaibelii, commonly known as the Kitaibel's woolly rose, is a species of flowering shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, white to grayish fuzzy hairs covering its stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, woolly appearance. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, pink to red flowers in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with serrated edges and a thick, leathery texture. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and hardy nature in temperate climates."
