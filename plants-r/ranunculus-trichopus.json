    "intro": "Ranunculus trichopus, commonly known as the hairy buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a basal rosette of hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of small, yellow, five-petaled flowers. The plant is characterized by its finely divided leaves and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family, known for its showy flowers and often toxic sap. The species is also called the water buttercup due to its preference for wet habitats."
