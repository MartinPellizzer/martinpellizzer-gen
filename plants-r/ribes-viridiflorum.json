    "intro": "Ribes viridiflorum, commonly known as the greenflower gooseberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It belongs to the genus Ribes, which includes various species of currants and gooseberries. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are usually dark green with a slightly hairy texture. Its flowers are greenish-white and appear in clusters, blooming in early spring before the leaves fully develop. The berries, which ripen in late summer, are typically yellow or orange and are edible, though they are not as commonly cultivated as other Ribes species."
