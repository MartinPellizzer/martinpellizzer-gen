It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to sandy soils and saline conditions. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss.
