    "intro": "Rivea hartmannii, commonly known as the Hartmann's morning glory, is a climbing vine native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to violet. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rapid growth habit makes it both a valuable ornamental plant and a potential invasive species in certain areas."
