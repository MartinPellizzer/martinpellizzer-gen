    "intro": "Ricinus tunisensis, commonly known as the Tunisian castor bean, is a perennial shrub native to North Africa. It is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are often lobed and have a distinctive appearance. The plant produces spiny capsules that contain toxic seeds, similar to other members of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, showing adaptability to poor soils. While it shares some traits with the more widely known Ricinus communis, it is less commonly cultivated for its oil-rich seeds."
