    "intro": "Reldia calcarata, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and is often found growing on rocky outcrops or in dry, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, showy flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and the plant is adapted to thrive in harsh, arid environments. Reldia calcarata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a specimen plant."
