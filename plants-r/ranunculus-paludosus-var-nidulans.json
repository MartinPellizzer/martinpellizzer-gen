    "intro": "Ranunculus paludosus var. nidulans, commonly known as the water crowfoot, is a perennial aquatic plant native to wetlands and slow-moving water bodies. It features delicate, floating leaves that are typically divided into three to five segments, giving it a lily-like appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with five petals, often accompanied by numerous stamens. It thrives in nutrient-rich, shallow waters and is often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Due to its preference for moist environments, it plays an important role in maintaining water quality and providing habitat for aquatic life."
