    "intro": "Reseda difformis, commonly known as the variable reseda, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many other well-known plants such as cabbages and mustards. The plant is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Reseda difformis is often found in dry, disturbed soils and can thrive in sunny, open habitats."
