    "intro": "Rhodalsine geniculata var. procumbens, commonly known as the creeping rhodalsine, is a low-growing perennial plant native to specific regions of South America. It features slender, prostrate stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Its flowers are small and clustered, usually in loose inflorescences, and can range in color from white to pale pink. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks."
