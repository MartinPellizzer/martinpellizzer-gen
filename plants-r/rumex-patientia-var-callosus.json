    "intro": "Rumex patientia var. callosus, commonly known as the rough dock, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a distinctive layer of rough, glandular hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in wet meadows and along stream banks. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
