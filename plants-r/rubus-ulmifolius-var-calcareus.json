It is characterized by its finely toothed, ovate leaves that often have a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by edible, dark purple berries. It thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in woodland edges and rocky areas. This variant is notable for its adaptability to alkaline conditions and its role in supporting local wildlife."
