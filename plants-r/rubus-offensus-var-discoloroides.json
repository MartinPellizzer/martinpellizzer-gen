    "intro": "Rubus offensus var. discoloroides, commonly known as the variable bramble, is a species of shrub native to parts of eastern North America. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or black in color. It thrives in moist, wooded areas and is often found in disturbed soils. Due to its variability in appearance, it can be challenging to distinguish from other Rubus species."
