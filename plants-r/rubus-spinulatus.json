    "intro": "Rubus spinulatus, commonly known as the prickly rose or sand rose, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is a shrub characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant produces edible berries that are typically red or black in color, though they are often covered in a fine, whitish bloom. Native to regions of Europe, Asia, and North America, it thrives in sandy or rocky soils. Its botanical features make it both a resilient plant and a valuable component of local ecosystems."
