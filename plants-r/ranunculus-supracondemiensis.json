    "intro": "Ranunculus supracondemiensis, commonly known as the Sierra Madre buttercup, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central Mexico. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family, characterized by its showy, often brightly colored flowers. The plant typically has palmately divided leaves and produces small, yellow flowers with numerous stamens. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is of particular interest to botanists studying alpine flora."
