    "intro": "Rhus salicina, commonly known as smooth sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and turn vibrant red in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in upright clusters, followed by fuzzy, red berries that are a food source for birds and wildlife. Smooth sumac thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in open woods, fields, and along roadsides. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a common and widespread species in the eastern United States."
