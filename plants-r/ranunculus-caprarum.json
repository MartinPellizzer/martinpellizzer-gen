    "intro": "Ranunculus caprarum, commonly known as the alpine buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky habitats, thriving in cool, moist environments. The plant features delicate, palmately divided leaves and showy yellow flowers with numerous petals. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in high-altitude conditions. Ranunculus caprarum plays an important role in alpine ecosystems, supporting pollinators and contributing to biodiversity."
