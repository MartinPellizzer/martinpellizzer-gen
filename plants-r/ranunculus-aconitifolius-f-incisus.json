    "intro": "Ranunculus aconitifolius f. incisus, commonly known as the incised aconite leaf buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features delicate, palmately divided leaves with finely toothed margins, which give it its distinctive appearance. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with five petals, often accompanied by numerous stamens. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is typically found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it requires specific growing conditions to flourish."
