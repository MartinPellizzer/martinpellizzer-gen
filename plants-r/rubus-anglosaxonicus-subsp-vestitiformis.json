    "intro": "Rubus anglosaxonicus subsp. vestitiformis, commonly known as the brambles or blackberry shrub, is a thorny, deciduous shrub native to Europe. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically three to five leaflets, and its aggregate fruits, which develop from multiple ovaria. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, followed by edible berries in the summer. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, fertile ground. This subspecies is often found in hedgerows, woodland edges, and disturbed areas."
