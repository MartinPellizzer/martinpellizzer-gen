    "intro": "Ritterocereus laevigatus, commonly known as the smooth-stemmed night bloomer, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are covered in sparse, white spines. The plant produces large, fragrant white flowers that bloom at night, typically during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its unique appearance and nocturnal blooming habit, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and botanical gardens."
