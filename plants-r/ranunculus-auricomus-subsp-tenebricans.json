    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus subsp. tenebricans, commonly known as the shadowy buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers with deeply lobed petals and a central yellow stamen. The leaves are palmately divided and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
