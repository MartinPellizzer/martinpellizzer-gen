    "intro": "Rosa hermanni, commonly known as the Hermann's rose, is a species of shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and thorny stems, which are typical of many rose species. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, pink to red flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are pinnate, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets, and its roots are fibrous and adapted to rocky soils. Rosa hermanni is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its beauty and hardiness."
