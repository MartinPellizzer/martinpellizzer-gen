    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 delectus, commonly known as the blackberry raspberry hybrid, is a deciduous shrub belonging to the Rosaceae family. It is a natural hybrid between Rubus ursinus (blackberry) and Rubus idaeus (raspberry), resulting in a plant that exhibits traits of both parent species. The plant produces aggregate fruits that are typically dark red to black in color, with a sweet-tart flavor. Its thorny stems and trifoliate leaves are characteristic of the Rubus genus. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its edible fruits."
