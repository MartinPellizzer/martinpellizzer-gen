    "intro": "Rosa glauca var. kaufmannii, commonly known as the Kaufmann's blue rose, is a variant of the blue rose species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its striking bluish-pink petals, which are a result of the presence of delphinidin, a flavonoid pigment. The plant typically grows as a shrub with thorny stems and dark green, lance-shaped leaves. It blooms in late spring to early summer, producing clusters of fragrant, semi-double flowers. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique color and hardiness."
