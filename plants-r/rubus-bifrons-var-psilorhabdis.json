    "intro": "Rubus bifrons var. psilorhabdis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry genus native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, elliptical leaves with a distinctive, slightly serrated margin. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically edible, though they may have a tart or slightly astringent flavor. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Due to its unique morphology and habitat preferences, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
