    "intro": "Rubus praedirus, commonly known as the red-fruited blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces aggregate fruits that are typically red when mature, though they may also ripen to a dark purple or black color. Its flowers are white or pale pink, and it blooms in the spring before the fruit develops. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
