    "intro": "Rubus fruticosus var. agrestis, commonly known as brambles or blackberries, is a thorny, shrub-like plant belonging to the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically three to five leaflets, and its clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces edible berries that ripen to a dark purple or black color, often used in culinary and medicinal applications. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is commonly found in hedgerows, woodlands, and disturbed areas. Its aggressive growth habit and ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes make it an important species in ecological studies."
