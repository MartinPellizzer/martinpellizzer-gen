    "intro": "Ruellia cristata, commonly known as the crowned ruellia, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its distinctive crown-like shape formed by its dense, upright foliage. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically blue or purple in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Ruellia cristata thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
