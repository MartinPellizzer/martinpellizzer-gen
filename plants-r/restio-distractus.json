    "intro": "Restio distractus, commonly known as the endangered silver restio, is a member of the Restionaceae family, native to South Africa. It is a perennial herb characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and narrow, silver-gray leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences, typically during the cooler months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal fynbos vegetation. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is classified as critically endangered, making conservation efforts essential for its survival."
