    "intro": "Rubus amabilis var. microcarpus, commonly known as the dwarf raspberry, is a shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its small, erect stems and trifoliate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, red berries that are typically less than 1 cm in diameter. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
