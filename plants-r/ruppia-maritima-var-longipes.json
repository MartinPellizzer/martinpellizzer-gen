    "intro": "Ruppia maritima var. longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed sea rocket, is a halophyte that thrives in brackish and saline waters. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that help reduce water loss in its coastal habitat. It plays a vital role in stabilizing sediments and providing habitat for aquatic organisms. Its distribution is primarily along estuaries and coastal marshes in temperate regions."
