    "intro": "Reynoldsia venusta, commonly known as the golden rain tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its showy, yellow inflorescences that resemble clusters of small flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has pinnately compound leaves that are alternate and often have a serrated edge. Its fruit is a three-lobed capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds. Reynoldsia venusta is adapted to well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping."
