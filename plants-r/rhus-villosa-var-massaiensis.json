    "intro": "Rhus villosa var. massaiensis, commonly known as the Massai sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Africa. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically alternate and consist of several oval to lance-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in panicles, followed by clusters of red, fleshy berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. The species is valued for its ornamental qualities and has traditional uses in local communities."
