    "intro": "Rosa eglanteria var. longa, commonly known as the long-stemmed brambles, is a thorny shrub native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its long, arching stems and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces red, hairy fruits that are edible but often have a strong, tart flavor. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it is often found in hedgerows and woodland edges. This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in hedging and fruit cultivation."
