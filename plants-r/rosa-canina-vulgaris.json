    "intro": "Rosa canina vulgaris, commonly known as the dog rose, is a shrub native to Europe, western Asia, and north Africa. It is characterized by its thorny stems, simple leaves, and fragrant pink or white flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces red, hairy fruits called hips, which are rich in vitamin C and used in traditional medicine. Rosa canina vulgaris is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens. It plays an important role in supporting pollinators and wildlife in natural habitats."
