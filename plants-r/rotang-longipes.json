    "intro": "Rotang longipes, commonly known as the long-peduncled rattan, is a climbing palm native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, slender stems and pinnate leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in panicles, which are followed by dark brown, woody fruits. Its roots and stems are valued for their strength and flexibility, making them useful in traditional crafts and construction. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered a threatened species in its native range."
