    "intro": "Rhododendron principis, commonly known as the Prince's rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, leathery leaves and dense clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to deep red. The plant typically grows at elevations between 1,000 and 2,500 meters, where it thrives in cool, moist climates. Its floral structure is adapted for pollination by birds and insects, and it produces small, woody capsules that contain numerous seeds. Rhododendron principis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
