    "intro": "Ruehssia yamanigueyensis, commonly known as the Yamanigu\u00e9 Yew, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Andean regions of South America. It is a small evergreen tree or shrub characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces red berries that contain seeds, which are dispersed by birds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments at high altitudes, typically in cloud forests. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
