    "intro": "Rachia, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flower heads, which are surrounded by spiny, leaf-like bracts. The plant is native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and is adapted to salty, windy environments. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Rachia is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in challenging conditions."
