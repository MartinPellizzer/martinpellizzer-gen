    "intro": "Rubus interjungens, commonly known as the common blackberry, is a perennial shrub belonging to the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces aggregate fruits, known as drupes, which are typically dark purple to black in color. These fruits are edible, though the berries are often covered in a fine, white, waxy coating. Rubus interjungens is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it thrives in temperate climates."
