    "intro": "Randia dioica, commonly known as American hogweed, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its opposite, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white or greenish flowers. The plant produces small, round berries that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands. Due to its invasive nature, it can outcompete native vegetation in certain regions."
