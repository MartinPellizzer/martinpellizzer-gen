    "intro": "Rubus lasiocarpus, commonly known as the rough-fruited blackberry, is a species of bramble native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, dark purple berries that are typically covered in a fuzzy, whitish layer. These berries are edible but often have a tart flavor, making them popular for use in jams and wines. Botanically, it belongs to the Rosaceae family and is closely related to other blackberry and raspberry species."
