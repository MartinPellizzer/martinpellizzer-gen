    "intro": "Rubus kennedyanus, commonly known as Kennedy's blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its thorny stems, trifoliate leaves, and clusters of small, dark berries. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its flowers are white and appear in the spring, followed by the development of its edible fruits in the summer. The berries are often used in jams and preserves due to their tart flavor and high pectin content."
