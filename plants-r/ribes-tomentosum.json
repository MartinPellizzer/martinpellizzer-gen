    "intro": "[WRONG START] Ribes tomentososum, commonly known as the fuzzy gooseberry, is a deciduous shrub native to North America. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves that give it a distinctive fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by edible, tart berries in the summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Ribes tomentosum is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in traditional medicine."
