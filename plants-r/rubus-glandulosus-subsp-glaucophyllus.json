It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves with a distinctive bluish-white underside. The plant produces aggregate fruits composed of small, dark red to black drupes. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and thickets. Its botanical features make it identifiable within the Rubus genus, though it is less commonly cultivated than other blackberry species."
