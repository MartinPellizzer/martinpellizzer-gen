    "intro": "Ranunculus macropus, commonly known as the large-flowered buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to southern and eastern Australia. It features upright, hairy stems that bear alternate, trifoliate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with prominent, showy sepals that are often mistaken for petals. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along waterways. Due to its striking appearance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain environments."
