    "intro": "Rhododendron cuprescens, commonly known as the purpleleaf rhododendron, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its dense, upright growth habit and its striking, dark purple to almost black foliage that contrasts beautifully with its showy, bell-shaped flowers. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, pink to reddish-purple blooms in the spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically leathery and have a serrated edge, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Rhododendron cuprescens thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes."
