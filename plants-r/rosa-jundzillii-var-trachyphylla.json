    "intro": "Rosa jundzillii var. trachyphylla, commonly known as the rough-leaved rock rose, is a shrub-like plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and dark green, rough-textured leaves. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, pale pink to white flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and arid landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and garden design."
