    "intro": "Rhododendron purdomii var. purdomii, commonly known as the Purdom's rhododendron, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan Province in China. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to deep red. The plant typically grows at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist, and shaded environments. Its botanical features include leathery leaves with a prominent midrib and floral bracts that are often larger than the actual flowers. Due to its restricted habitat and conservation status, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
