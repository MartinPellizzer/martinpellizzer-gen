    "intro": "Rubus rivanus, commonly known as the alpine raspberry, is a species of bramble native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its erect or scrambling growth habit and produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or orange in color. The plant features compound leaves with serrated edges and produces white or pale yellow flowers in early summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its hardy nature, it plays an important role in stabilizing soil in high-altitude ecosystems."
