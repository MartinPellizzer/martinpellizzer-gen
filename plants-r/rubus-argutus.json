    "intro": "Rubus argutus, commonly known as the prickly rose or brambles, is a species of shrub belonging to the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, white or pink flowers. The plant produces edible red berries, though they are often overshadowed by its more aggressive growth habit. Native to North America, it thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed areas. Its extensive root system allows it to spread rapidly, making it both a common weed and a valuable source of food for wildlife."
