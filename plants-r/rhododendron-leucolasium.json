It is characterized by its broad, leathery leaves that are typically white or pale green in color, giving it a striking appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often blooming in early spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments with acidic soil, making it a popular choice for shaded garden settings. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is also of interest to botanists and conservationists."
