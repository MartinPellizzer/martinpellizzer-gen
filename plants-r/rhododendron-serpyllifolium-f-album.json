It is characterized by its white flowers, which contrast with the typical pink or purple blooms of the species. The plant is a low-growing shrub with dense, evergreen foliage that is typically covered in a thick, woolly coating. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or heathland environments. This form is particularly prized for its ornamental value in gardens and natural landscapes."
