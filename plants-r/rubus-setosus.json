    "intro": "Rubus setosus, commonly known as the bristly blackberry, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is native to temperate regions of Asia and is characterized by its thorny stems and aggregate fruits. The plant produces dark purple to black berries that are edible, though often tart and less sweet than common blackberries. Its leaves are typically trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it thrives in well-drained soils. Rubus setosus is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
