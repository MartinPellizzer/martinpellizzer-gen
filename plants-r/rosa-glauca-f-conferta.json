Its flowers are typically pale blue to white, with a subtle fragrance, and bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is characterized by its short, wiry stems and small, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, waxy bloom. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and is prized for its ornamental value in gardens. This form of Rosa glauca is particularly hardy and adaptable, making it suitable for a variety of growing conditions."
