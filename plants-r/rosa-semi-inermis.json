    "intro": "Rosa semi-inermis, commonly known as the shrub rose or sweetbriar rose, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is native to parts of Europe and western Asia, and it thrives in temperate climates. The plant is characterized by its thornless stems, which distinguish it from other rose species, and its fragrant, white to pink flowers. Its leaves are compound, consisting of five to seven oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces red or orange hips in the fall. Rosa semi-inermis is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and as a hedge plant."
