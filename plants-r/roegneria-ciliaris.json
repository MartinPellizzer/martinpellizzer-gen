It is characterized by its fine, silver-blue foliage and compact growth habit, often forming dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Roegneria ciliaris is adapted to well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements contribute to its widespread cultivation in landscaping."
