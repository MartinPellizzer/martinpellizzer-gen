    "intro": "Rubus ulmifolius subvar. longiflorens, commonly known as the long-flowered blackberry, is a shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically three-lobed and resemble those of the elm tree. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that mature to a dark purple or black color. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, fertile ground. This subvariety is often cultivated for its edible berries and ornamental value."
