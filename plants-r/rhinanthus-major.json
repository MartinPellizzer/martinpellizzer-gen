    "intro": "Rhinanthus major, commonly known as the common yellow rattle, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom from June to August. The plant is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. It thrives in grasslands and meadows, often found in disturbed soils. Its presence is an indicator of biodiverse and healthy grassland ecosystems."
