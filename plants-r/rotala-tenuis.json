    "intro": "Rotala tenuis, commonly known as the thread-leaf water lettuce, is a floating aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It has small, narrow leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern on the water surface. The plant produces tiny white flowers that bloom above the water, often in clusters. It is often used in aquariums and ponds for its ornamental value and ability to absorb nutrients from the water. Its rapid growth makes it both a useful and sometimes invasive species in aquatic environments."
