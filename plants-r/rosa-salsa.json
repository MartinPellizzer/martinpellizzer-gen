    "intro": "Rosa salsa, commonly known as the \"salsa rose,\" is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with thorny stems and small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces edible berries that are often used in culinary applications, particularly in traditional Mexican cuisine. Rosa salsa thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to harsh, dry environments. Its resilience and ornamental value make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and wildlife habitats."
