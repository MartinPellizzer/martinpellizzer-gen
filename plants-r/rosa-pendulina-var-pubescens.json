    "intro": "Rosa pendulina var. pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent climbing rose, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its long, arching stems that can climb or trail along the ground, often forming dense, sprawling growth. The plant produces fragrant, semi-double pink flowers in early summer, which are followed by small, red-orange hips. Its leaves are compound, with five to seven oval-shaped leaflets, and are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in gardens for its cascading habit and showy blooms."
