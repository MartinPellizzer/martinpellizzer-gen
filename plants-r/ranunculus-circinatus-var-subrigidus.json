    "intro": "Ranunculus circinatus var. subrigidus, commonly known as the rigid water crowfoot, is a aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds, lakes, and streams. The plant features finely divided, feather-like leaves that are often submerged, with showy yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. Its stems are usually rigid and can be found floating on the water surface or partially submerged. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
