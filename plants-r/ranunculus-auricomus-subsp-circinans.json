    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus subsp. circinans, commonly known as the golden shield or golden ragwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features basal leaves that are palmately lobed and often covered in fine hairs, while the upper leaves are more linear. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with five broadly ovate petals that are typically hairy on the upper surface. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, riverbanks, and woodland edges. The subspecies circinans is distinguished by its more compact growth habit and slightly different leaf morphology compared to the typical form of R. auricomus."
