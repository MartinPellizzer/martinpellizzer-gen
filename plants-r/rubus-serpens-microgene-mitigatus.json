    "intro": "Rubus serpens microgene mitigatus, commonly known as the lesser blackberry vine, is a perennial shrub native to the temperate regions of the Pacific Northwest. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit, thorny stems, and small, dark purple to black berries. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its leaves are compound, with three to five leaflets, and are covered in fine hairs. The berries are edible when ripe but are generally tart and used in local foraging traditions."
