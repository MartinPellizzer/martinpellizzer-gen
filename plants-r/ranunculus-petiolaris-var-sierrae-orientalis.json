    "intro": "Ranunculus petiolaris var. sierrae-orientalis, commonly known as the Sierra Oriental buttercup, is a rare and delicate wildflower native to the mountainous regions of California. It features small, showy yellow flowers with five petals and a hairy, glandular stem. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forest floors and meadows. Its leaves are palmately lobed and often covered in fine hairs. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
