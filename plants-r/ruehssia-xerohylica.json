    "intro": "Ruehssia xerohylica, commonly known as the desert rue, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant is adapted to survive in dry environments, with features such as reduced leaf surface area to minimize water loss. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access water from lower soil layers. Ruehssia xerohylica is often found in rocky soils and is considered a hardy, drought-tolerant species."
