    "intro": "Rajania microphylla, commonly known as the dwarf rajania, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Araceae and is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves and striking white flowers with a spathe. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and swampy areas. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it requires specific humidity and light conditions to thrive."
