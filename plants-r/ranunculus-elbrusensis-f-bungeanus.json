    "intro": "Ranunculus elbrusensis f. bungeanus, commonly known as the Elbrus buttercup, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the high-altitude regions of the Caucasus Mountains. It is characterized by its delicate, yellowish flowers with five petals and a hairy, upright stem. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine meadows, thriving in cool and moist environments. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a rough texture and a distinctive, waxy coating. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
