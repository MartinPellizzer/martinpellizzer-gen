It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of white or pink flowers. The plant produces edible blackberries, though the fruit is often small and less flavorful compared to other Rubus species.

The leaves are trifoliate, with a serrated margin, and the plant is known for its vigorous growth and adaptability."
