It features arching, thornless stems that grow close to the ground, often forming a dense, mat-like structure. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink to white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are compound, consisting of five to seven oval-shaped leaflets with a soft, velvety texture. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping for its ability to thrive in shaded or partially sunny conditions."
