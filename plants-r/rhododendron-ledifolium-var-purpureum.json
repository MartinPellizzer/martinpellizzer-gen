    "intro": "Rhododendron ledifolium var. purpureum, commonly known as the purpleleaf azalea, is a compact evergreen shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It features dense, dark green foliage that turns a striking purple-red in the fall, adding vibrant seasonal color to the landscape. The plant produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to red, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and seasonal foliage changes."
