    "intro": "Rubus oligospermus, commonly known as the rare blackberry, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically edible but not as widely cultivated as other Rubus species. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
