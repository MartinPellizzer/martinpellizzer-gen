    "intro": "Rubus horridus var. rosaceus, commonly known as the brambles rose or prickly rose, is a shrub native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces edible berries, though they are often covered in a fine layer of white, waxy bloom. It thrives in woodland edges and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. The leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the plant is known for its aggressive growth habit."
