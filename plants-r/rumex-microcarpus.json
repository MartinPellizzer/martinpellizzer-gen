    "intro": "Rumex microcarpus, commonly known as narrowleaf sorrel, is a herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its upright stems and heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are borne on slender stalks. Its leaves contain oxalic acid, giving them a sour taste and making them useful in culinary applications. Rumex microcarpus thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas."
