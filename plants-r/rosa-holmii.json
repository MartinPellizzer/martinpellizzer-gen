    "intro": "Rosa holmii, commonly known as the Holm's rose, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, including parts of Turkey, Iran, and the Caucasus. The plant is characterized by its upright growth habit, thorny stems, and clusters of fragrant pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are compound, consisting of five to seven elliptical leaflets, and the plant produces small, oval-shaped fruits called hips. Rosa holmii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
