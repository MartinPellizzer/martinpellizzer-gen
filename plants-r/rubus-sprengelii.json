    "intro": "Rubus sprengelii, commonly known as the Sprengel's blackberry, is a species of brambles native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in late spring, which are followed by dark purple to black berries in the fall. Its botanical features include a woody stem with persistent buds, and its fruit is edible, though often tart and less commonly cultivated than other blackberry varieties. Rubus sprengelii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in its native habitat."
