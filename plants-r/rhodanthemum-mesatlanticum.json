    "intro": "Rhodanthemum mesatlanticum, commonly known as the Atlantic rhodanthemum, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Atlantic Ocean. It is characterized by its showy, brightly colored flowers that typically bloom in shades of red, yellow, and orange. The plant has adapted to salty air and sandy soils, making it a hardy species found in maritime environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a fine layer of wax, which helps reduce water loss. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and its ability to thrive in challenging coastal conditions."
