    "intro": "Ranisia, commonly known as the golden bell vine, is a climbing plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It features heart-shaped, velvety leaves and produces striking yellow-orange, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is popular in gardens and as a houseplant. Its rapid growth habit makes it suitable for trellises or as a ground cover. Ranisia is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
