    "intro": "Rhamnus rupestris, commonly known as the rock elderberry, is a shrub native to the western United States. It typically grows in rocky or dry habitats, such as cliffs and slopes, and is well adapted to arid conditions. The plant has small, dark green leaves and produces clusters of yellowish-green flowers in the spring. Its fruit is a small, black berry that ripens in late summer. Rhamnus rupestris is valued for its hardiness and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
