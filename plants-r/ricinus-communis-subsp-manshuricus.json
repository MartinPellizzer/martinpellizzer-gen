It is a herbaceous annual that produces distinctive spiny capsules containing toxic seeds. The plant features large, palmately lobed leaves with a rough, hairy texture. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats. Due to its toxic properties, it is important to handle the plant with care."
