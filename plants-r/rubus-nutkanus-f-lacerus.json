    "intro": "Rubus nutkanus f. lacerus, commonly known as the rough blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant characterized by its distinctive, rugged foliage and fruit. It is native to the Pacific Northwest of North America, where it thrives in moist, temperate climates. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically smaller than those of other blackberry species. Its leaves are serrated and have a rough texture, contributing to its common name. This form is often found in woodlands and along stream banks, where it plays a role in local ecosystems."
