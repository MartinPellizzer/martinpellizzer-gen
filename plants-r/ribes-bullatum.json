    "intro": "Ribes bullatum, commonly known as the smooth currant, is a deciduous shrub native to North America. It features small, oval leaves that are typically smooth and dark green on top, with a lighter underside. The plant produces clusters of white to pink flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, edible berries that ripen in late summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Ribes bullatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing food for birds and pollinators."
