    "intro": "Rubus illegitimus, commonly known as the false blackberry, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or black in color. It is native to parts of Asia and is often found in woodland and shrubland habitats. Due to its similarity to true blackberries, it can be easily confused with other Rubus species."
