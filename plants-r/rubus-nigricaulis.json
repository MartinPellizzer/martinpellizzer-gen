    "intro": "Rubus nigricaulis, commonly known as the black-stemmed bramble, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is native to eastern North America and is characterized by its woody, thorny stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits known as drupes, which are typically red or black in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and thickets. Due to its invasive nature in some regions, it can outcompete native vegetation and alter local ecosystems."
