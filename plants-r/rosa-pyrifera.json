    "intro": "Rosa pyrifera, commonly known as the pineapple rose, is a species of flowering plant native to the coastal regions of California and Baja California. It is characterized by its distinctive, pineapple-shaped inflorescence, which consists of tightly packed, red-orange flowers. The plant produces edible fruits that are often used in culinary applications. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of fine, silvery hairs that help protect it from salt spray and intense sunlight. Rosa pyrifera is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and full sun exposure."
