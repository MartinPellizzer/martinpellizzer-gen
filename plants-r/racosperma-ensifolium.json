    "intro": "Racosperma ensifolium, commonly known as the broad-leaved acacia, is a shrub native to Australia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically broad and linear, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in spikes, which are often visited by pollinators such as bees and birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. Racosperma ensifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
