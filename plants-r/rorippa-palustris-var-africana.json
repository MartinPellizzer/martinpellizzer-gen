It typically grows in shallow water, mud, or wetlands, with leaves that are floating or submerged. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are usually deeply lobed or divided, and the stems are often branched. It plays a role in stabilizing aquatic environments and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
