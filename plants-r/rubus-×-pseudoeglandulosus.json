    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 pseudoeglandulosus, commonly known as the blackberry bramble, is a hybrid species within the Rubus genus. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves, typical of many brambles. The plant produces aggregate fruits, commonly referred to as blackberries, which are edible and often used in culinary applications. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in hedgerows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils. Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits a range of morphological variations, making it a subject of interest in botanical studies."
