It is a perennial herb characterized by its dense, spike-like inflorescence composed of small, greenish flowers. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its leaves are grass-like, narrow, and often have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Rhynchospora globulifera plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and birds."
