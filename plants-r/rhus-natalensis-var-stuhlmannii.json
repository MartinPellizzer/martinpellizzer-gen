    "intro": "Rhus natalensis var. stuhlmannii, commonly known as the Natal buckthorn, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically arranged in an alternate pattern along the stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in spherical inflorescences, followed by red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for birds and mammals. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, sandy or loamy soils. The species is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and seasonal interest."
