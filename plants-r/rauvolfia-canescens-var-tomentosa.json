    "intro": "Rauvolfia canescens var. tomentosa, commonly known as Indian snakeroot, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, pale green flowers that are typically clustered in axillary inflorescences. Its roots are rich in alkaloids, particularly reserpine, which has been historically used in traditional medicine. This species is valued both for its medicinal properties and its role in ecological systems."
