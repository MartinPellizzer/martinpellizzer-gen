    "intro": "Rauvolfia mauiensis, commonly known as Maui's passionflower, is a climbing shrub native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its intricate, showy flowers that resemble those of passionflowers. The plant produces small, orange-yellow fruits that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. Its leaves are heart-shaped and often have a waxy texture, while its stems are woody and twining. Rauvolfia mauiensis is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to the island's ecosystem and its role in local biodiversity."
