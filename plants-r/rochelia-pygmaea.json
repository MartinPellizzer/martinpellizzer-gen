    "intro": "Rochelia pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf sea lettuce, is a small, green algae that thrives in coastal environments. It belongs to the family Ulvaceae and is characterized by its thin, ribbon-like fronds that float on the surface of shallow marine waters. This species is typically found in rocky intertidal zones where it attaches to substrates using a holdfast. Rochelia pygmaea plays a role in coastal ecosystems by providing habitat for small marine organisms and contributing to nutrient cycling. Its rapid growth and ability to withstand tidal fluctuations make it a resilient component of coastal flora."
