    "intro": "Rorippa bonariensis var. bonariensis, commonly known as the Argentine watercress, is a herbaceous annual plant native to South America. It typically grows in wet or waterlogged soils, often found in marshy areas or along the edges of ponds. The plant has alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are usually submerged or floating, and it produces small, white flowers with four petals. It is valued for its peppery flavor and is used in salads and as a garnish. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in moist conditions make it a common weed in aquatic environments."
