It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, erect stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Rhynchopera micklowii is typically found in moist, well-drained soils in coastal or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
