It features fragrant, semi-double pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has dark green, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires partial to full sunlight for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique botanical and horticultural value."
