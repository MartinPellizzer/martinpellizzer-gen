    "intro": "Rangium suspensum, commonly known as the hanging mistflower, is a flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, pendulous inflorescences that produce small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in the understorey of tropical forests. Its leaves are usually opposite and have a smooth, glossy surface. Rangium suspensum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in moist, well-drained soil."
