    "intro": "Royena rugosa, commonly known as the roughleaf rosenia, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its hairy, rough-textured leaves and showy, pink or red flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full sun. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely grown outside its native range."
