    "intro": "Rhamnus capensis, commonly known as the coastal buckthorn, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, thorny branches and small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by black, berry-like fruits that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in coastal and sandy environments, often growing in association with other hardy, drought-resistant species. Rhamnus capensis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
