    "intro": "Ranunculus ultramontanus, commonly known as the Alpine buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It typically grows in rocky or mountainous habitats, where it thrives in well-drained, acidic soils. The plant features basal leaves with a distinctive heart-shaped form and bright yellow flowers with five petals. It blooms from late spring to early summer, and its flowers are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
