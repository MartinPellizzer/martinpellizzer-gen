    "intro": "Rumex patagonicus, commonly known as Patagonian sorrel, is a perennial herb native to South America. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and is often found in moist, temperate regions. The plant features alternate, lanceolate leaves with a distinctive reddish or purple coloration on the underside. Its flowers are small and clustered in spikes, typically appearing in early spring. Rumex patagonicus is known for its edible leaves, which have a tangy, sour flavor due to the presence of oxalic acid."
