    "intro": "Ranunculus transkuopioensis, commonly known as the Transkuopio buttercup, is a rare flowering plant native to Finland. It is characterized by its delicate, yellow flowers with five petals and a hairy stem. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and wetlands. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it produces small, greenish sepals beneath the petals. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
