It features trifoliate leaves with three ovate leaflets and produces small, yellow flowers that give way to elongated, curved pods. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. It is a valuable forage plant for livestock due to its high protein content. Additionally, it has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
