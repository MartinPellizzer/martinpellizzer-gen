    "intro": "Rubus gothicus, commonly known as the ghost raspberry, is a shrub native to northern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, arching stems and small, dark red berries that appear in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the flowers are white with five petals. The berries are edible but have a tart flavor, and the plant is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes."
