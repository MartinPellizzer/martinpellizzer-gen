    "intro": "Ribes odoratum f. serotinum, commonly known as the late-flowering gooseberry, is a compact shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its dark green, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom later in the season compared to the typical gooseberry species. Its berries are typically smaller and less showy than those of other Ribes species. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
