    "intro": "Rosa spinosissima var. inermis, commonly known as the smooth thorned rose, is a variant of the spinosissima rose species. It is characterized by its lack of prickles on the stems, making it more suitable for garden use. The plant produces fragrant, semi-double pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is a deciduous shrub that thrives in full sun and well-drained soil. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and hedge planting."
