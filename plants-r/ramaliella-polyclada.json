    "intro": "Ramaliella polyclada, commonly known as the clustered liverwort, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is a non-vascular plant characterized by its small, flattened, and often lobed thallus that grows in moist, shaded environments. The plant typically forms dense clusters, which help it retain moisture and thrive in humid conditions. Its reproductive structures, including male and female gametophytes, are borne on the thallus surface. Ramaliella polyclada is often found in rocky crevices or on decaying wood in temperate regions."
