    "intro": "Rhodocactus horridus, commonly known as the devil's claw, is a cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its spiny, segmented stems and bright yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, adapting to harsh desert conditions with its thick, fleshy stems that store water. Its unique appearance and resilience make it a striking addition to succulent collections. The species is also valued for its ability to prevent soil erosion in desert landscapes."
