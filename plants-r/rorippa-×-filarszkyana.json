    "intro": "Rorippa \u00d7 filarszkyana, commonly known as the hybrid watercress, is a member of the Brassicaceae family. It is a naturally occurring hybrid between Rorippa islandica and Rorippa sylvestris, both of which are aquatic or semi-aquatic plants. The plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as ponds, marshes, and along the edges of streams. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often submerged or floating, with small white flowers that appear in clusters. The hybrid is notable for its adaptability and is sometimes cultivated for its edible leaves, similar to other members of the watercress genus."
