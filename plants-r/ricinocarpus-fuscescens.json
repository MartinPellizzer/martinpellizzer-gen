    "intro": "Ricinocarpus fuscescens, commonly known as the black mangrove, is a flowering plant species native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia and Australia. It is a small, shrub-like tree that thrives in saline and brackish water environments. The plant has dark, leathery leaves and produces small, pale yellow flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. Its root system includes pneumatophores, specialized structures that help in gas exchange in waterlogged soils. Ricinocarpus fuscescens plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms."
