    "intro": "Ranunculus fallax subsp. sonckii, commonly known as the Sonck's buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features showy, yellow flowers with five to eight petals, often with a distinctive central tuft of stamens. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are typically hairy, and it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. It is often found in alpine meadows and subalpine habitats at high elevations. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it requires specific growing conditions to flourish."
