    "intro": "Rosa canina var. viridiglauca, commonly known as the greenish-blue dog rose, is a variant of the dog rose species native to parts of Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive foliage, which has a unique greenish-blue hue due to the presence of specific pigments. The plant typically grows as a shrub, reaching heights of up to 2 meters, and produces small, fragrant flowers in the spring. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with serrated edges, and the stems are covered in thorns. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been cultivated for both its aesthetic appeal and historical use in herbal medicine."
