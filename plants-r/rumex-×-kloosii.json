    "intro": "Rumex \u00d7 kloosii, commonly known as the hybrid sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant that belongs to the Polygonaceae family. It is a natural hybrid between Rumex acetosa (common sorrel) and Rumex acetobulus (broadleaf sorrel), resulting in a plant with distinctive foliage. The leaves are typically heart-shaped with a reddish or purple tint on the veins, and they have a sour taste due to high levels of oxalic acid. This plant thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest in both horticulture and ecological studies."
