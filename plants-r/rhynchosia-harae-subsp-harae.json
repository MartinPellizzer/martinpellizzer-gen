    "intro": "Rhynchosia harae subsp. harae, commonly known as the African burr legume, is a perennial shrub native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often trifoliate or pinnate, and its distinctive yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, spherical pods that enclose several seeds, which are adapted for dispersal by animals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and abandoned fields. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
