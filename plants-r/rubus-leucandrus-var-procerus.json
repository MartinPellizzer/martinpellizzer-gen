    "intro": "Rubus leucandrus var. procerus, commonly known as the woolly blackberry, is a shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its dense, white-tomentose (woolly) foliage and stems, which provide insulation and protection from herbivores. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black when ripe. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Botanically, it is closely related to other Rubus species and is notable for its unique pubescent features."
