    "intro": "Rivina viridiflora, commonly known as the green-flowered rivina, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, featuring opposite, oval-shaped leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. These flowers are followed by bright red berries that attract birds, aiding in seed dispersal. Rivina viridiflora is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in partial shade to full sun."
