    "intro": "Rubus schistogenes, commonly known as the rockberry, is a species of bramble native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or black in color. It thrives in rocky and well-drained soils, often growing in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within the Rubus genus."
