    "intro": "Rotheca myricoides f. brevilobata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rotheca, is a holarctic plant species belonging to the family Ericaceae. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and narrow, lanceolate leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or red, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as heaths and rocky outcrops. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
