    "intro": "Rumex maritimus, commonly known as sea sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal regions of Europe and Asia. It thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found along shorelines and in tidal zones. The plant has alternate, oval-shaped leaves with a distinctive reddish coloration on the underside. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in loose spikes, typically blooming in spring. The plant is known for its tart, sour taste due to the presence of oxalic acid in its leaves."
