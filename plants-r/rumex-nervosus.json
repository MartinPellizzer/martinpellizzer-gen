    "intro": "Rumex nervosus, commonly known as narrow-leaf dock, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features alternate, lanceolate leaves with prominent veins, which give it its scientific name. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Its rhubarb-like leaves are edible but are typically not cultivated for consumption."
