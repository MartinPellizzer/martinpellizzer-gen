It is a herbaceous perennial plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. The plant features delicate, yellow flowers with five petals and numerous stamens, typical of the genus Ranunculus. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. The species is notable for its medicinal properties, though it contains toxic compounds that require careful handling."
