    "intro": "Roystonea floridana, commonly known as the Florida royal palm, is a tall, slender palm native to the southeastern United States. It features a slender trunk with a smooth, grayish-brown bark and is crowned with a large, feather-like frond cluster. The plant has pinnate leaves that are long and narrow, contributing to its elegant appearance. It produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into orange-red fruits, which are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. This species is well adapted to coastal and sandy soils, making it a common sight in Florida's landscapes."
