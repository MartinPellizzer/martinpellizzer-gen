    "intro": "Rachicallis, commonly known as the spurge or Euphorbia, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Euphorbiaceae. These plants are characterized by their milky sap, which can be toxic and cause skin irritation. Many species of Rachicallis are shrubs or herbs, often with simple, alternate leaves and small, clustered flowers. They are native to various regions, primarily in Africa, Asia, and the Americas. The genus includes both ornamental and medicinal species, some of which have been used in traditional medicine for centuries."
