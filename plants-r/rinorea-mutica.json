    "intro": "Rinorea mutica, commonly known as the sticky leaf vine, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and distinctive, sticky leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. Rinorea mutica thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests or along stream banks."
