    "intro": "Rosa jundzillii var. pseudoscabrata, commonly known as the rough-stemmed shrub rose, is a shrub-like species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and dark green, leathery leaves that are often covered with a fine, rough texture. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink to red, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a hardy ornamental plant. Due to its ornamental value and resilience, it is occasionally cultivated in colder climates."
