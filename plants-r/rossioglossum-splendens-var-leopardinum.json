It is characterized by its vibrant green and yellow striped leaves, which resemble the pattern of a leopard's coat. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and green, often with a distinctive red lip. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts for its unique appearance."
