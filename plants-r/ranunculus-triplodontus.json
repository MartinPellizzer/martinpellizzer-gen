    "intro": "Ranunculus triplodontus, commonly known as the three-toothed buttercup, is a flowering plant belonging to the Ranunculaceae family. It is characterized by its showy, yellow or orange flowers with five to seven sepals that resemble petals. The plant typically grows in moist, temperate regions and has a hairy stem with trifoliate leaves. Its roots are fibrous and often used in traditional medicine. However, it is considered toxic due to the presence of protoanemonin, a compound that can cause skin irritation."
