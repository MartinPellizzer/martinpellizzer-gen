    "intro": "Rossioglossum splendens var. pantherinum, commonly known as the Panther Orchid, is a striking tropical orchid native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant, showy flowers that range in color from deep red to orange, often with intricate patterns resembling panther skin, hence its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded forest environments. Its leaves are broad and glossy, often with a waxy coating that helps retain moisture. The orchid produces fragrant blooms that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, playing a role in the ecological balance of its native habitat."
