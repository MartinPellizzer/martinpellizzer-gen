    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus subsp. acuistylus, commonly known as the narrow-styled golden buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the western United States. It features showy, bright yellow flowers with five to nine petals, typically appearing in late spring to early summer. The plant has finely divided, trifoliate leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along streambanks. The subspecies is distinguished by its more slender, pointed style compared to the typical form of R. auricomus."
