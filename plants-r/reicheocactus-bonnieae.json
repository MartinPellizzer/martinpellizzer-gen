    "intro": "Reicheocactus bonnieae, commonly known as Bonnie's cactus, is a rare and striking member of the Cactaceae family native to the rocky hills of northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem covered in dense, pale green to blue-gray spines. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring, which are often followed by small, red fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, requiring minimal water once established. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
