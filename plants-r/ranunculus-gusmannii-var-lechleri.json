    "intro": "Ranunculus gusmannii var. lechleri, commonly known as the curare plant, is a member of the Ranunculaceae family. It is native to the Amazon rainforest and is characterized by its delicate, often hairy leaves and showy yellow flowers. The plant is notable for containing toxic compounds, particularly curare, which has been historically used by indigenous peoples for hunting. Its botanical features include a short, stout stem and palmate leaves with lobed margins. Due to its toxic properties, it requires careful handling and is often cultivated in controlled environments."
