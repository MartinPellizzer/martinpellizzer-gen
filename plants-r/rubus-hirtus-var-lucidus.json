    "intro": "Rubus hirtus var. lucidus, commonly known as the glossy raspberry, is a variant of the raspberry plant native to parts of North America. It is characterized by its smooth, glossy leaves and bright red, aggregate fruits that develop from multiple small drupes. The plant typically grows in woodland areas and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Its flowering period occurs in late spring, producing white to pale pink flowers that attract pollinators. The fruit is often used in culinary applications, though it is less commonly cultivated than other raspberry varieties."
