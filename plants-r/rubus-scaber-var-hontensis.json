It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red when ripe. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species."
