    "intro": "Rubus minutiflorus var. ochraceus, commonly known as the yellow-flowered blackberry, is a variant of the Rubus genus native to western North America. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, which distinguish it from other Rubus species. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are trifoliate, with a serrated margin, and the fruit is a small, aggregate berry that ripens to a dark purple or black color. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique floral display."
