    "intro": "Rubus uncinatus var. ericetorum, commonly known as the bracken raspberry, is a variant of the brambles native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a shrub that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features compound leaves with serrated edges and produces small, aggregate fruits known as drupes. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, and it has thorny stems that can make handling difficult. This species is characterized by its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and its role in supporting local wildlife."
