    "intro": "Rhaphispermum gerardioides, commonly known as the Florida buttonwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Arecaceae, which includes palms, and is characterized by its compact size and dense foliage. The plant features a smooth, grayish-brown trunk and produces clusters of small, white flowers that develop into edible, round fruits. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with numerous narrow, leathery leaflets that provide shade and contribute to its ornamental value. Rhaphispermum gerardioides is well adapted to wetland environments and is often found in swamps and along riverbanks."
