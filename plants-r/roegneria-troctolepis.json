    "intro": "Roegneria troctolepis, commonly known as the slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects and as a forage crop."
