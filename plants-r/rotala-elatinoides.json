    "intro": "Rotala elatinoides, commonly known as the water lettuce, is a floating aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It has broad, waxy leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern on the water's surface. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or white in color. It is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in some areas if not managed properly."
