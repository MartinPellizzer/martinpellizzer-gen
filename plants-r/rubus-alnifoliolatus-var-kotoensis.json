It features compound leaves with three to five leaflets, often with serrated edges, and produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or yellow in color. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in mountainous regions. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and has limited use in culinary applications. Its botanical characteristics make it a unique subject of study in plant taxonomy and ecology."
