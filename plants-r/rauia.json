    "intro": "Rauia, commonly known as the \"false orchid,\" is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It consists of several species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, South America, and parts of Asia. The plants typically have slender, often hairy stems and produce small, clustered flowers in various colors, including white, yellow, and pink. Rauia species are epiphytic or terrestrial, often growing on trees or in moist, shaded environments. Their botanical significance lies in their unique floral structures and ecological roles in their native habitats."
