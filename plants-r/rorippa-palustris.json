    "intro": "Rorippa palustris, commonly known as the marsh cinquefoil, is a small, herbaceous plant that typically grows in wetland environments. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and is often found in marshes, pond edges, and stream banks. Its leaves are alternate and have a distinctive five-lobed shape, which gives it its common name. Rorippa palustris is an important part of wetland ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various insects and small aquatic organisms."
