    "intro": "Rebutia calliantha f. breviseta, commonly known as the short-stemmed rebutia, is a compact, low-growing cactus native to South America. It features short, cylindrical stems that are typically covered in dense, white to pale green spines. The plant produces showy, funnel-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, or red during the spring and early summer. Its foliage is reduced to small, woolly areoles, and it thrives in well-draining soil with ample sunlight. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
