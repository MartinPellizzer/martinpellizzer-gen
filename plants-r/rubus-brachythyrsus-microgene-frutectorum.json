    "intro": "Rubus brachythyrsus microgene frutectorum, commonly known as the dwarf raspberry, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its small, thorny stems and dense clusters of tiny, edible berries. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in temperate climates with cold winters. Its flowers are white or pale pink, and the fruit develops into a red, hairy berry. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and somewhat endangered species."
