It features showy, yellow flowers with five to seven petals that are often adorned with a distinctive golden crown at the base. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are hairy and covered in a waxy coating. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas or along stream banks.
