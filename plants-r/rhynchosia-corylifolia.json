It is characterized by its compound leaves with heart-shaped leaflets, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow flowers followed by elongated pods containing kidney-shaped seeds. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, known for nitrogen-fixing capabilities through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. Rhynchosia corylifolia is often cultivated for its edible seeds and is also used in traditional medicine."
