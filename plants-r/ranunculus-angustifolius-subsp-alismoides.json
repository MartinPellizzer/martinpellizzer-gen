    "intro": "Ranunculus angustifolius subsp. alismoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved buttercup, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, yellow flowers with five petals and its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family, which includes many other showy and often toxic plants. The subspecies alismoides is distinguished by its more slender leaves and slightly different floral structure compared to the typical form of Ranunculus angustifolius."
