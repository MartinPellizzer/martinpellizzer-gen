    "intro": "Rubus micans var. leucanthus, commonly known as the white-flowered blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant characterized by its pale white or cream-colored flowers. It is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States, typically found in moist, wooded areas. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are edible but often less flavorful than other blackberry varieties. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the plant has a thorny stem structure typical of the Rubus genus. Botanically, it is notable for its unique floral coloration and its role in local ecosystems as a food source for wildlife."
