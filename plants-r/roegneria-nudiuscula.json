    "intro": "Roegneria nudiuscula, commonly known as the slender wheatgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to temperate regions of Asia and North America. It features slender, erect stems that are often covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and typically have a bluish-green hue. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed sites. Roegneria nudiuscula is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
