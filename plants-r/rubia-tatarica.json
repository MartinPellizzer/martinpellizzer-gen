    "intro": "Rubia tatarica, commonly known as tatarian knotweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to eastern Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, pale yellow flowers. The plant produces distinctive, elongated seed pods that split open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Its leaves are typically ovate to elliptic in shape, with a slightly hairy surface. Rubia tatarica is often found in moist, shaded woodlands and is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
