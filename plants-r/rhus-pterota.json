    "intro": "Rhus pterota, commonly known as the staghorn sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and have serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in panicles, followed by red, fuzzy fruits that are a common food source for birds. Its bark is thick and rugged, with a distinctive appearance that gives it its common name. Rhus pterota is often found in moist, open woods and is valued for its ornamental features and ecological benefits."
