    "intro": "Racinaea spiculosa var. stenoglossa, commonly known as the narrow-lipped racinaea, is a rare and striking orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and its unique, elongated flower spikes that bear small, pale green to white flowers. The species is notable for its specialized pollination mechanism, which involves specific insect pollinators. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically in lowland rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
