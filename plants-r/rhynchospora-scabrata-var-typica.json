    "intro": "Rhynchospora scabrata var. typica, commonly known as the roughleaf beakspur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy habitats in North America. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in fine, rough hairs. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences of greenish-white flowers, which are typically inconspicuous and lack showy petals. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in regions with high humidity and seasonal flooding. Rhynchospora scabrata var. typica plays a role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and birds."
