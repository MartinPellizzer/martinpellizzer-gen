It is characterized by its dense, grayish-white pubescent foliage and stems, which provide a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant pink flowers in the spring, which are borne on elongated peduncles. Its flowers are typically arranged in umbels, giving the species its botanical name. Rosa tomentosa subvar. umbelliflora is well adapted to moist, sunny environments and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks."
