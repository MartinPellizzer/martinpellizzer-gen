    "intro": "Rumex aquaticus subsp. arcticus, commonly known as Arctic sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Arctic and alpine regions. It typically grows in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found near water bodies such as lakes and streams. The plant has alternate, broadly ovate to lanceolate leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its flowers are small and clustered in terminal spikes, with greenish-yellow bracts. The plant is adapted to cold climates and has a short growing season, flowering and setting seed quickly during the summer months."
