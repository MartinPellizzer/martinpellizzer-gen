    "intro": "Rubus coloniatus, commonly known as the colonized raspberry, is a species of brambles native to eastern North America. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant produces compound leaves with serrated edges and bears small, aggregate fruits that are red when mature. It has a woody stem covered in thorns, which are characteristic of many Rubus species. The plant's botanical features make it well-adapted to its native habitat, though it is not commonly cultivated for agricultural purposes."
