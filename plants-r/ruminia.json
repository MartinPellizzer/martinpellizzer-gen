    "intro": "Ruminia, commonly known as the white hibiscus, is a genus of flowering plants in the mallow family, Malvaceae. It consists of several species, most notably Ruminia lobata, which is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. The plants are characterized by their showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. They typically grow as shrubs or small trees, often with hairy stems and lobed leaves. Ruminia species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
