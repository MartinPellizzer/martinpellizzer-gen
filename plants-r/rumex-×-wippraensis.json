    "intro": "Rumex \u00d7 wippraensis, commonly known as the hybrid sorrel, is a naturally occurring hybrid between Rumex acetosa (common sorrel) and Rumex acetobulus (broad-leafed sorrel). It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive reddish coloration on the veins and underside. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its botanical features make it a notable example of hybridization in the Polygonaceae family."
