    "intro": "Rubus hirtus var. erythrostachys, commonly known as the red-stemmed blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to parts of North America. It is characterized by its thorny stems and dark, edible berries that ripen in the summer. The plant typically grows in woodland areas and along stream banks, preferring moist, well-drained soil. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the flowers are usually white or pale pink. The berries are often used in jams and pies, though the plant is also valued for its ornamental qualities."
