    "intro": "Rhamnus glabra, commonly known as the smooth buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters and features smooth, greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by black, egg-shaped berries in the fall. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and usually elliptical with a smooth margin. Rhamnus glabra is often found in woodland edges, hedgerows, and disturbed soils, and it plays a role in supporting local wildlife."
