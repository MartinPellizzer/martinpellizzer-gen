    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 idaeiformis, commonly known as the Pacific blackberry, is a hybrid plant native to the western coast of North America. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and thorny stems, which help it climb and spread along the ground. The plant produces aggregate fruits composed of small, juicy drupelets, which are typically dark purple to black in color. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it thrives in moist, temperate climates. Rubus \u00d7 idaeiformis is valued for its edible berries and is often found in coastal and riparian habitats."
