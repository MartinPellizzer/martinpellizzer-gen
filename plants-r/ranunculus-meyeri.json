It typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters, featuring a basal rosette of large, lobed leaves. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with five to eight petals, often accompanied by numerous sepals. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, preferring cool, temperate climates.
