    "intro": "Rubus plicatus subsp. typicus, commonly known as the prickly rose or bristly blackberry, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rosaceae. It is native to parts of Europe and Asia and is characterized by its thorny stems and aggregate fruits. The plant typically grows in woodland edges, hedgerows, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are palmately lobed, and the flowers are pink to white, appearing in late spring. The fruit, a dark purple to black aggregate berry, is edible but has a tart flavor."
