    "intro": "Rhynchospora globularis var. pinetorum, commonly known as the pine barrens sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland habitats, such as pine flatwoods and wet pine savannas, where it thrives in acidic, sandy soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spike-like clusters. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, which can stabilize soil and support local biodiversity. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and role in wetland ecosystems."
