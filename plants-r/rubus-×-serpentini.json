    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 serpentini, commonly known as the blackberry-elderberry hybrid, is a botanical cross between Rubus fruticosus (blackberry) and Rubus caesius (elderberry). It is a shrub that produces small, dark purple to black berries, which are typically smaller than those of pure blackberries. The plant has thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges, typical of the Rubus genus. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in hedgerows or woodland edges. The berries are edible but can be tart and are sometimes used in jams or wines."
