    "intro": "Rubus vestitus subsp. drejeri, commonly known as the Greenland raspberry, is a shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which provide insulation against cold temperatures. The plant produces small, red berries that are typically consumed by birds and other wildlife. It thrives in moist, rocky soils and is often found in tundra and coastal areas. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within the Rubus genus."
