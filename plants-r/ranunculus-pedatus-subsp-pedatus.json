    "intro": "Ranunculus pedatus subsp. pedatus, commonly known as the creeping buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a creeping rhizome that allows it to spread across the ground, forming dense mats. The plant produces showy yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are deeply lobed and arranged alternately along the stems. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wet meadows, ditches, and along stream banks."
