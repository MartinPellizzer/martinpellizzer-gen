    "intro": "Rosa \u00d7 odorata var. erubescens, commonly known as the Crimson Rug rose, is a hybrid shrub characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and showy, semi-double pink to red flowers. It is a vigorous grower with a spreading habit, making it suitable for ground cover or as a border plant. The plant is deciduous, shedding its leaves in autumn, and produces hips that are orange-red and edible. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Its ornamental value comes from its vibrant blooms and durable, low-maintenance nature."
