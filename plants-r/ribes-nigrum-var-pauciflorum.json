    "intro": "Ribes nigrum var. pauciflorum, commonly known as the black currant dwarf, is a compact variety of the black currant plant. It is characterized by its small, dark purple berries that are typically smaller than those of the standard black currant. The plant has narrow, elliptical leaves with a slightly serrated edge, and it produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers in early spring. It thrives in cooler climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and edible fruits. This variety is more cold-hardy than the standard black currant, making it suitable for a wider range of growing conditions."
