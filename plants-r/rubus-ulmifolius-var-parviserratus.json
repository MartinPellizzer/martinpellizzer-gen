    "intro": "Rubus ulmifolius var. parviserratus, commonly known as the small-toothed blackberry, is a variant of the brambles native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, arching stems and small, serrated leaves that are typically less than 5 cm in length. The plant produces clusters of small, dark purple to black berries that ripen in late summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands and along hedgerows. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
