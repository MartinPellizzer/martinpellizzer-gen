    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 falsicontractifolius, commonly known as the false blackberry. This hybrid plant is a member of the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, dark red berries. It is native to parts of eastern North America and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils. The leaves are typically trifoliate, with three leaflets that are serrated and covered in fine hairs. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been cultivated for its edible fruits, though they are generally smaller and less flavorful than those of true blackberries."
