    "intro": "Rhus amerina, commonly known as the staghorn sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically arranged in pairs along the stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by bright red, fuzzy berries that attract birds and other wildlife. Rhus amerina thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native plant gardens."
