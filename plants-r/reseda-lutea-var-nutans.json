    "intro": "Reseda lutea var. nutans, commonly known as the nodding scarlet pimpernel, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow and red. The plant has hairy, linear leaves and produces slender, branching stems that often grow in open habitats such as meadows and roadsides. Its flowers are known to close at night and on cloudy days, a trait that gives it its common name. The plant is also valued for its historical use in dye production and as a decorative garden plant."
