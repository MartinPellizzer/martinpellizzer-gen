    "intro": "Ruschia vulvaria, commonly known as the red sand verbena, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are typically green with a reddish tinge. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to red, often blooming in summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Due to its drought tolerance, it is well-suited for xeriscaping and low-maintenance gardens."
