    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus subsp. crassiusculus, commonly known as the broad-leaved buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features showy, yellow flowers with five broad, petal-like sepals that resemble true petals. The plant has palmately divided leaves with a distinctive, waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for garden cultivation, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
