    "intro": "Rubus sachalinensis var. coreanus, commonly known as the Korean raspberry, is a species native to East Asia, particularly Korea and parts of Russia. It is a shrub that typically grows in forested areas and mountainous regions, often in moist, shaded environments. The plant produces small, edible red berries that are similar in appearance to regular raspberries but have a distinct flavor. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the plant has a woody stem covered in thorny projections. It is valued both for its ornamental qualities and its use in traditional medicine and culinary applications."
