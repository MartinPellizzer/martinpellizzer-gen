    "intro": "Rhododendron campylogynum, commonly known as the narrowleaf rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia, particularly in China. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in acidic, well-drained soils and thrives in shaded to partially shaded environments. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, providing a striking contrast to the vibrant floral displays. Rhododendron campylogynum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental qualities and ability to thrive in specific ecological niches."
