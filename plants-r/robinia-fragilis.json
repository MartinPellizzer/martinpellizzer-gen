    "intro": "Robinia fragilis, commonly known as the yellowwood or false acacia, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are alternate and pinnately arranged, with 12 to 20 oval-shaped leaflets. The tree produces fragrant, yellowish-white flowers in upright clusters during the spring, followed by flat, pod-like fruits that mature in the fall. Its bark is thick, fissured, and has a distinctive grayish-brown color. Robinia fragilis is known for its hard, heavy wood, which is resistant to decay and historically used for shipbuilding and furniture."
