    "intro": "Rosa humilis var. grandiflora, commonly known as the dwarf garden rose, is a compact, shrub-like plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features fragrant, semi-double to double pink or white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, thorned stems and dark green, trifoliate leaves that are slightly hairy beneath. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or borders. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for small garden spaces."
