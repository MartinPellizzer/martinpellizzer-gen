    "intro": "[WRONG START] Rosa canina f. pseudomalmundundariensis, commonly known as the false Malmundariensis rose, is a rare botanical variant of the dog rose. This form exhibits distinctive floral characteristics, including larger and more vibrant petals compared to the typical Rosa canina. It is primarily found in specific geographic regions, often in woodland or scrub habitats. The plant retains the general structure of the parent species, with thorny stems and pinnately compound leaves. Due to its limited distribution and unique traits, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
