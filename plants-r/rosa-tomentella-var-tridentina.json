    "intro": "Rosa tomentella var. tridentina, commonly known as the tridentate woolly rose, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and thorny stems, which provide it with a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
