It is characterized by its thorny stems, pinnately compound leaves, and showy, pink to white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces aggregate fruits, known as drupes, which are typically dark purple to black when mature. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and stream banks. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and is also used in some local culinary traditions."
