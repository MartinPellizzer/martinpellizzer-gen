    "intro": "Ruta rosmarinifolia var. longifolia, commonly known as long-leaved rue, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features aromatic, dark green, lance-shaped leaves that are often longer than those of the typical Ruta rosmarinifolia. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are followed by narrow, elongated berries. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. The leaves and flowers are used in traditional medicine and as a culinary herb, though they should be used with caution due to their potential toxicity."
