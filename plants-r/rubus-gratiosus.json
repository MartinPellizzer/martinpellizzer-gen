    "intro": "Rubus gratiosus, commonly known as the graceful raspberry, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of white to pale pink flowers. The plant produces small, edible berries that are typically red when ripe, though they are often less flavorful than other raspberries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and thickets. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for garden cultivation."
