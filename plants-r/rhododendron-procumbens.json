    "intro": "Rhododendron procumbens, commonly known as the creeping azalea, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It features dense clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep pink, typically blooming in late spring. The plant has dark green, leathery leaves that are opposite and often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a valuable addition to native plant landscapes."
