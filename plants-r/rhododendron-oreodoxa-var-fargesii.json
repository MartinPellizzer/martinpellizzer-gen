It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in cool, humid climates and thrives in acidic, well-drained soils. It is often found in forested areas at high altitudes, where it forms part of the undergrowth. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
