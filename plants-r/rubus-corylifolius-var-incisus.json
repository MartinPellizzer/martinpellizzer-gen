It is characterized by its large, trifoliate leaves that are often deeply lobed and have a distinctive, somewhat heart-shaped appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by dark purple, edible berries in the summer. Its berries are used in traditional Chinese medicine and as a flavoring agent. The plant thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and fruit."
