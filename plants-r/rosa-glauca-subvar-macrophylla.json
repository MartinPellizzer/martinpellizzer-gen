    "intro": "Rosa glauca subvar. macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leafed blue rose, is a variant of the blue rose species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its striking deep blue petals, which are a result of high levels of delphinidin pigments. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, with a slightly hairy surface. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique color and resilience."
