    "intro": "Rathbunia treleasei, commonly known as the Trelease's rathbunia, is a rare and endemic species native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is a shrub-like plant characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves and small, clustered white flowers. The plant produces small, round fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by animals. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to the nutrient-poor soils of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
