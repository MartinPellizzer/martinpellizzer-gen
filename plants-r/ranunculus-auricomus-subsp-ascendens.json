    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus subsp. ascendens, commonly known as the ascending buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features delicate, palmately divided leaves and bright yellow, cup-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and stream banks. Its botanical characteristics include a short, stout rhizome and hairy stems that become more prominent with age. The subspecies is distinguished by its upward-facing flowers and slightly elongated growth habit compared to the typical form."
