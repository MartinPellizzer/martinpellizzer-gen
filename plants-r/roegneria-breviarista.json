    "intro": "Roegneria breviarista, commonly known as the narrowleaf wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets. It is often found in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes. Due to its hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated for erosion control and as a forage crop."
