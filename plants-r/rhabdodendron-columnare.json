    "intro": "Rhabdodendron columnare, commonly known as the silver fir, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its long, slender needles that are typically silver-white underneath, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces small, spherical cones that mature to a reddish-brown color. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in temperate forests. Its slow growth rate and ornamental value make it a popular choice for horticultural cultivation."
