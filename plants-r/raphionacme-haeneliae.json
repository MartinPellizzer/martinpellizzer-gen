    "intro": "Raphionacme haeneliae, commonly known as the narrowleaf false forget-me-not, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Boraginaceae and is characterized by its small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss. Raphionacme haeneliae is an herbaceous perennial that plays a role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining biodiversity in its native habitat."
