    "intro": "Rosa canina subvar. glaucescens, commonly known as the glaucous dog rose, is a subspecies of the dog rose native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its pale greenish-yellow flowers and hairy stems, which distinguish it from other rose varieties. The plant typically grows as a shrub with thorny stems and pinnate leaves with serrated edges. Its fruit, a red, hairy rosehip, is similar to that of the common dog rose but often more elongated. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in traditional medicine."
