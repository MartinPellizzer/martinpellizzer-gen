    "intro": "Ranunculus japonicus f. hirsutus, commonly known as the hairy Japanese buttercup, is a variant of the Japanese buttercup characterized by its dense, hairy foliage. It is a herbaceous perennial plant native to East Asia, particularly Japan, and thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with five petals, often accompanied by numerous stamens. Its hairy leaves and stems are adaptations that help reduce water loss and deter herbivores. This cultivar is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
