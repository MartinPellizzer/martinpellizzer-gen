    "intro": "Rorippa atrovirens f. longicarpa, commonly known as the long-seeded watercress, is a variant of the watercress species native to moist or aquatic environments. It is characterized by its elongated, siliquae (seed pods) that are longer than those of the typical form, giving it its specific epithet. The plant typically grows in shallow water or wet soil, often in temperate regions. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a slightly hairy texture. The flowers are small, yellow, and clustered in racemes, typical of the Brassicaceae family."
