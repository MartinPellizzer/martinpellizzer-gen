    "intro": "Rumex graminifolius var. subspathulatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf dock, is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves. It typically grows in moist, often calcareous soils and is found in wet meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are borne on slender, erect spikes. Its leaves are often covered with a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in wet environments. The species is noted for its ecological importance as a food source for various insects and as a component of wetland ecosystems."
