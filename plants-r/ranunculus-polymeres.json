    "intro": "Ranunculus polymeres, commonly known as the many-flowered buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features delicate, yellow flowers with numerous small petals arranged in a star-like pattern, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has a basal rosette of heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, and it produces a tall, leafy stem that supports its showy inflorescence. Ranunculus polymeres prefers well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, often growing in alpine or rocky habitats. Its botanical characteristics make it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine landscapes."
