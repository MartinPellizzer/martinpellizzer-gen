It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod-bearing fruits. The plant features trifoliate leaves with stipules, and its flowers are typically small and clustered in racemes. It thrives in dry, open habitats and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. The subspecies is distinguished by its distinctive bracts and smaller, more compact growth form compared to other Rutidea species."
