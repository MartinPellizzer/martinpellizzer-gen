    "intro": "Roemeria hybrida var. immaculata, commonly known as the white roemeria, is a hybrid plant belonging to the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 feet and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It is often found in woodland areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal. The varietal name 'immaculata' refers to its pure white flower color, which stands out against its green foliage."
