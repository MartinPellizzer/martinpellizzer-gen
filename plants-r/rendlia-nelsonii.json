    "intro": "Rendlia nelsonii, commonly known as the Nelson's rendlia, is a flowering plant native to the island of Rodrigues in the Indian Ocean. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub, with opposite, simple leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, and it produces small, round berries that are edible but not widely consumed by humans. Rendlia nelsonii is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to its island habitat."
