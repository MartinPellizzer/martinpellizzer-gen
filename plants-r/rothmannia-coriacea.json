    "intro": "Rothmannia coriacea, commonly known as the rough-leaved rothmannia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy, and often rough-textured leaves that store water, aiding in its survival in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer, adding a delicate touch to its appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Rothmannia coriacea is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to dry climates."
