    "intro": "Rosa bracteata var. scabricaulis, commonly known as the rough-stemmed rose, is a variant of the bracteata rose species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, rough-textured stems and leaves, which provide a distinctive appearance. The plant produces fragrant, pink to red flowers that bloom in late summer. It is a deciduous shrub, typically growing to a height of 1 to 2 meters. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and full sun."
