    "intro": "Rhododendron pseudociliipes, commonly known as the ciliate-leaved rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and showy, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in acidic, well-drained soils and thrives in partially shaded to sunny conditions. Its leaves are distinctive for their finely ciliate margins, which give it its common name. Rhododendron pseudociliipes is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes."
