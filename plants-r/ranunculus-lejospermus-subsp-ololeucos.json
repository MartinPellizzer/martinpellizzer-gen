It typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant features showy yellow flowers with five to eight petals, and its leaves are palmately divided with a hairy surface. It produces small, greenish-yellow fruits that contain numerous seeds. This subspecies is adapted to harsh environments and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats."
