    "intro": "Rhexia baccharoides, commonly known as the swamp pink, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in wetlands and swampy areas, thriving in moist, acidic soils. The plant produces showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it has a rhizomatous root system that helps it spread vegetatively. Rhexia baccharoides plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
