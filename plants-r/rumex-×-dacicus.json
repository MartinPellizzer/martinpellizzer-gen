    "intro": "Rumex \u00d7 dacicus, commonly known as the hybrid sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant that belongs to the Polygonaceae family. It is a natural hybrid between Rumex acetosa (common sorrel) and Rumex acetobatus (water sorrel), resulting in a plant with unique botanical characteristics. The leaves are broad, heart-shaped, and have a distinctive sour taste due to the presence of oxalic acid. It typically grows in moist, acidic soils and is often found near water bodies or in damp meadows. Its flowers are small and greenish-white, arranged in dense clusters, and it is known for its ornamental value as well as its historical use in herbal medicine."
