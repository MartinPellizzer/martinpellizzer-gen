    "intro": "Rhus, commonly known as sumac, is a genus of flowering plants in the anacardiaceae family. These plants are typically shrubs or small trees, often characterized by their compound leaves and clusters of small, bright red or orange fruits. The leaves are usually pinnately compound, with numerous leaflets that can be serrated or smooth depending on the species. Rhus species are native to various regions, including North America, Asia, and Africa, and many are adapted to dry or semi-arid environments. Some species are cultivated for their ornamental value, while others have been used traditionally for their medicinal properties."
