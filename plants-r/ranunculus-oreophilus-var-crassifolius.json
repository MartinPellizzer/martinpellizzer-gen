    "intro": "Ranunculus oreophilus var. crassifolius, commonly known as the broadleaf water crowfoot, is a perennial aquatic plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in shallow freshwater environments such as ponds, streams, and wet meadows. The plant features delicate, trifoliate leaves that are broad and rounded, often floating on the water surface. Its flowers are bright yellow with a distinctive central blotch, and they bloom in early spring. This variant is distinguished by its thicker, more robust foliage compared to other ranunculus species."
