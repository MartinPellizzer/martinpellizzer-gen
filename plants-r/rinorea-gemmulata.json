    "intro": "Rinorea gemmulata, commonly known as the gemmule rinorea, is a tropical shrub native to the Caribbean islands. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically arranged oppositely along the stems. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale pink, which bloom in clusters. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, spherical seeds. Rinorea gemmulata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to grow in well-drained, sunny environments."
