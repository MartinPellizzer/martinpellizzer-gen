    "intro": "Rubus hirsutus var. inermis, commonly known as the smooth blackberry, is a thornless variant of the blackberry plant. It is a deciduous shrub native to parts of North America, particularly the eastern United States. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are edible and often used in jams and pies. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and its stems are covered in fine, soft hairs. The botanical features of this plant make it distinct from other Rubus species due to its lack of thorns and unique fruit morphology."
