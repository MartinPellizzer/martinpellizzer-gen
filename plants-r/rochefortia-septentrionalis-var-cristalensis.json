    "intro": "Rochefortia septentrionalis var. cristalensis, commonly known as the Crystalensis Rochefortia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central Mexico. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces an underground bulb that stores nutrients. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
