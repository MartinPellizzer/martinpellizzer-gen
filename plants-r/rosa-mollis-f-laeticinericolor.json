    "intro": "Rosa mollis f. laeticinericolor, commonly known as the pink-veined meadow rose, is a unique floral variant of the meadow rose species. It is characterized by its soft pink petals with distinct, pale green veins that create a striking visual contrast. This form is typically found in moist, grassy areas and thrives in temperate climates. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its botanical interest lies in its unusual coloration and its role in pollination by bees and other insects."
