    "intro": "Rosa coriifolia var. subvialis, commonly known as the silverleaf shrub rose, is a compact, deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Asia. It is characterized by its silvery-white, fuzzy underside on its leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant pink flowers in early summer, followed by red-orange hips in the fall. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and hardiness in temperate climates. Its foliage and flowers make it a popular choice for garden borders and rock gardens."
