    "intro": "Rosa alpina var. coronata, commonly known as the Alpine rose or crown rose, is a compact, low-growing shrub native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features dense, upright stems covered in soft, grayish-green foliage. The plant produces showy, double pink flowers with a rich, sweet fragrance, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is well adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often cultivated in gardens with similar growing conditions."
