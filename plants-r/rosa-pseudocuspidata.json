    "intro": "Rosa pseudocuspidata, commonly known as the Chinese rose or the everblooming rose, is a species native to China and is characterized by its dense, thornless stems and clusters of fragrant, semi-double flowers. It produces pink to red blooms that remain on the plant for an extended period, giving it its \"everblooming\" reputation. The plant has elliptical, dark green leaves with serrated edges, and its flowers are typically 4 to 5 cm in diameter. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its showy appearance and long-lasting blooms. Rosa pseudocuspidata is also valued in traditional Chinese medicine for its purported health benefits."
