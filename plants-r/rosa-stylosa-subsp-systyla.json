    "intro": "Rosa stylosa subsp. systyla, commonly known as the narrowleaf rock rose, is a shrub native to the arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, often thornless stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance in landscaping."
