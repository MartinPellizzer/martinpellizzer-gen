    "intro": "Rubus purchasii, commonly known as the San Diego raspberry, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California. It is characterized by its prickly stems and clusters of white to pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, edible berries that are typically red or yellow when ripe. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal scrub habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
