    "intro": "Rubus pubescens var. contectus, commonly known as the rough bramble, is a thorny shrub native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It typically grows in woodland edges, hedgerows, and disturbed soils, thriving in partial to full sunlight. The plant features compound leaves with serrated edges and small, aggregate fruits that mature to a reddish-black color. Its stems are covered in dense, stiff hairs, giving it a rough texture. This variety is closely related to other Rubus species and is often found growing in association with other brambles in its native habitat."
