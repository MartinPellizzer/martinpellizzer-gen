    "intro": "Rhododendron semnoides, commonly known as the Himalayan rhododendron, is a species native to the eastern Himalayas. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows in high-altitude regions, often in moist, well-drained soils. The plant produces clusters of showy, pink to red flowers in the spring, which are followed by small, leathery berries. Its leaves are elliptical and have a leathery texture, often with a waxy coating. Rhododendron semnoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in temperate climates."
