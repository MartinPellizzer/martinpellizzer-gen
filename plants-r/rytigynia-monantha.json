    "intro": "Rytigynia monantha, commonly known as the white-flowered rytigynia, is a shrub native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its slender, woody stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Its fruits are small, capsule-like structures that release seeds when mature. Rytigynia monantha is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in supporting local wildlife in its native habitat."
