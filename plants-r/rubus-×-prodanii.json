    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 prodanii, commonly known as the blackberry-loganberry hybrid, is a deciduous shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is a naturally occurring hybrid between Rubus ursinus (blackberry) and Rubus ildenus (loganberry), resulting in a plant with unique botanical characteristics. The plant produces large, dark purple to black berries that are typically larger and sweeter than those of its parent species. Its foliage consists of serrated, lobed leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and riparian habitats."
