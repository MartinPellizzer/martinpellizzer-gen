    "intro": "Rhetinantha witsenioides, commonly known as the Witsen's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to South Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant produces a single, slender stem with a few leaves and blooms in late summer. It thrives in specific microhabitats, often growing on rocky outcrops or in shaded forest areas. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
