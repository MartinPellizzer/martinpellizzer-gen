It features delicate, yellow flowers with five to seven petals and a hairy, upright stem. The plant typically grows in moist, coastal environments such as cliffs, dunes, and sandy soils. Its leaves are deeply lobed and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. This variety is known for its adaptability to harsh coastal conditions and its role in supporting local pollinators."
