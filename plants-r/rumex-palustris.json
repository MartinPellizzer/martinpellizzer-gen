    "intro": "Rumex palustris, commonly known as marsh sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments. It features upright, slender stems that are often reddish in color and bear alternate, heart-shaped leaves with a waxy surface. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in moist, acidic soils and is often found in marshes, fens, and along stream banks. The leaves are edible and have been used in traditional cuisines, though they contain oxalic acid and should be consumed in moderation."
