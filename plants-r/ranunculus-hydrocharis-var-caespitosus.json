    "intro": "Ranunculus hydrocharis var. caespitosus, commonly known as the water crowfoot, is a aquatic plant native to freshwater habitats. It features small, delicate flowers with yellow stamens and a white or greenish pistil, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has finely divided, floating leaves that help it thrive in still or slow-moving water. Its roots are rhizomatous, allowing it to spread and form dense mats on the water surface. This variant is distinguished by its compact, clustered growth habit compared to other varieties of water crowfoot."
