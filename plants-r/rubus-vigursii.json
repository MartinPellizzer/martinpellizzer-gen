    "intro": "Rubus vigursii, commonly known as the Chinese blackberry, is a species of bramble native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and aggregate fruits, which are typically dark red to black in color. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by the development of its edible berries. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Rubus vigursii is often found in woodland areas and is valued both for its ornamental qualities and its fruit."
