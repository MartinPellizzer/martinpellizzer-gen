    "intro": "Ranunculus aquatilis var. calvescens, commonly known as the water crowfoot, is a aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in Europe and Asia. It features delicate, palmately divided leaves that float on the water surface or emerge from the water. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in early summer. It thrives in still or slow-moving waters and is often found in ponds, marshes, and along the edges of streams. Ranunculus aquatilis var. calvescens plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
