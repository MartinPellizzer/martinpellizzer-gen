    "intro": "Rubus genevieri subsp. brigantinus, commonly known as the Alpine bramble, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its thorny stems and trifoliate leaves, which are typically dark green and hairy. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers in early summer, followed by edible berries that are often used in local cuisines. It thrives in rocky and well-drained soils, preferring cool and humid climates. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and protected species in many areas."
