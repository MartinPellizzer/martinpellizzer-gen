    "intro": "Ranunculus subscaposus, commonly known as the slender-stemmed buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a low-growing habit with slender, often hairy stems that support a cluster of delicate, palmate leaves. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with five to seven sepals and numerous stamens, typical of the Ranunculaceae family. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
