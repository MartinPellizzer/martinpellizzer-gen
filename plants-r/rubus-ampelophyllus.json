    "intro": "Rubus ampelophyllus, commonly known as the climbing raspberry, is a species of bramble native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trailing or climbing growth habit, with slender stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red when mature, similar to other raspberries in the Rubus genus. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have serrated edges, with a hairy texture. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
