It is characterized by its pale pink to white flowers and thorny stems, typical of the Rosa canina species. The plant is native to Europe and thrives in temperate climates, often found in hedgerows and woodland edges. Its leaves are pinnate with serrated edges, and it produces red, hairy berries that are rich in vitamin C. This form is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in herbal medicine."
