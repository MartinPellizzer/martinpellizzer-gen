    "intro": "Radojitskya, commonly known as the \"gum tree\" or \"gum arabic tree,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Fabaceae. It is native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. The plant is characterized by its sturdy, often gnarled trunk and thick, flaky bark that exudes a sap-like substance called gum arabic. Radojitskya species are typically shrubs or small trees, with compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The genus is valued for its economic importance, particularly for the production of natural gum used in food, pharmaceuticals, and industrial applications."
