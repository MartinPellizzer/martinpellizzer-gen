    "intro": "Rosa squarrosa hampelii, commonly known as the Himalayan rock rose, is a species of flowering plant in the rose family. It is native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas, where it thrives in rocky and alpine environments. The plant is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of fragrant, pink to white flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are typically covered in a fine, white, woolly coating, which helps to reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. Rosa squarrosa hampelii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-draining soil and full sun exposure."
