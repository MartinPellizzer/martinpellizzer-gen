    "intro": "Restrepia porschii, commonly known as the Porschii restia, is a rare and enigmatic orchid native to the high-altitude regions of Ecuador. It belongs to the Epidendroideae subfamily and is characterized by its compact, sympodial growth habit. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, typically during the dry season. Its leaves are strap-like and succulent, adapted to store water in its native arid environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
