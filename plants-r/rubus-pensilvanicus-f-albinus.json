    "intro": "Rubus pensilvanicus f. albinus, commonly known as the white-fruited blackberry, is a botanical variant of the common blackberry. It is characterized by its pale or white-colored fruits, which contrast with the typical deep purple or black berries of the species. The plant belongs to the Rosaceae family and is native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in woodland areas and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. This form is less common than the standard Rubus pensilvanicus and is often noted for its unique fruit coloration."
