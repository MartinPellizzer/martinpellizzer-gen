It features showy, yellow flowers with red sepals that are typically more prominent than the petals. The plant has a basal rosette of lobed, hairy leaves and grows in moist, shady environments such as meadows and woodlands. Its flowers bloom in early spring and are pollinated by insects. The subspecies is distinguished by its vibrant red sepals, which contrast with the pale yellow petals."
