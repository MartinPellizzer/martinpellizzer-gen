    "intro": "Roegneria alashanica, commonly known as the Alashan needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of China. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, needle-like leaves that are typically hairy along the edges. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, which are adapted for wind pollination. Roegneria alashanica thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in steppe and desert steppe ecosystems. Its ecological importance lies in its role as a forage plant for grazing animals and its contribution to soil stabilization in fragile environments."
