    "intro": "Ronnbergia allenii, commonly known as the Allen's spider orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the cloud forests of Costa Rica and is characterized by its intricate, spider-like flower structure. The plant produces a single, showy inflorescence with pale green to white petals and a distinctive, elongated lip. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high air humidity and well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is often sought after by orchid enthusiasts."
