    "intro": "Rhododendron brookeanum subsp. cockburnii, commonly known as the Cockburn's rhododendron, is a rare and distinctive evergreen shrub native to the island of Borneo. It features broad, leathery leaves that are dark green and glossy, with a dense, compact growth habit. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink and white, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in montane forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
