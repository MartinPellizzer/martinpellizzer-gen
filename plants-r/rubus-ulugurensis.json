    "intro": "Rubus ulugurensis, commonly known as the Uluguru raspberry, is a species of bramble native to the Uluguru Mountains in Tanzania. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and produces small, edible berries that are rich in antioxidants. The plant has compound leaves with serrated edges and produces white or pale pink flowers in the spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical studies."
