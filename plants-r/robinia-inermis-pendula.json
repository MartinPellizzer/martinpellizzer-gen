    "intro": "Robinia inermis pendula, commonly known as the weeping false acacia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its pendulous, drooping branches that give it a distinctive, ornamental appearance. The plant produces fragrant, pale yellow flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by long, bean-like pods that contain seeds. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets, and it has a strong, pleasant aroma. The weeping false acacia is often cultivated for its aesthetic value in gardens and landscapes."
