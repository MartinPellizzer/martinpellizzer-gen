    "intro": "Rosa chavinii subvar. cuneata, commonly known as the Cuneata rose, is a rare and ancient species native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a subtle red hue. The plant has elliptical, medium-green leaves with a slightly serrated edge, and its stems are covered in soft, pale pink to white hairs. It thrives in cool, humid climates and is often found in cloud forests at high elevations. Due to its limited distribution and endangered status, it is highly valued in botanical gardens and conservation efforts."
