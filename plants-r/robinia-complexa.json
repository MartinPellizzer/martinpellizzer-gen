    "intro": "Robinia complexa, commonly known as the fragrant robinia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically pinnately arranged and have a distinctive grayish-green color. The plant produces showy, yellow, pea-like flowers in spring, followed by elongated, flat seed pods. It has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion, and its wood is highly valued for its strength and durability. Robinia complexa is also known for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its resistance to pests and diseases."
