    "intro": "Rebis macrobotrys, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It features large, broad leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter, floating on the surface of still water bodies. The plant produces showy, white flowers that bloom in the early morning and close by midday. Its roots anchor it in muddy substrates, while its rhizomes spread horizontally beneath the water. The leaves are thick and waxy, providing a habitat for various aquatic organisms."
