    "intro": "Rhododendron hypoleucophyllum, commonly known as the white-leaf rhododendron, is a species native to the Himalayas, particularly in regions of India, Nepal, and Bhutan. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage that is predominantly white to pale green, which distinguishes it from other rhododendron species. The plant typically grows in mountainous, humid environments at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters. Its flowers are usually pink to purple and bloom in late spring to early summer. Rhododendron hypoleucophyllum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
