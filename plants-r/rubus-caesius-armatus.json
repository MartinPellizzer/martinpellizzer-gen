It is characterized by its thorny stems and dark, glossy leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible berries that ripen to a deep black color. These berries are rich in antioxidants and are often used in local cuisines. Its botanical features make it an important component of the ecosystems it inhabits."
