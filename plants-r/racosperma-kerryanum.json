    "intro": "Racosperma kerryanum, commonly known as the Kerry acacia, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of northern Australia. It is characterized by its dense foliage of narrow, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in compact, globular clusters, which are followed by flat, pod-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun conditions. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is often cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
