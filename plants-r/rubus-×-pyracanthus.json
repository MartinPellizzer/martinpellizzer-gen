    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 pyracanthus, commonly known as the hybrid raspberrycross, is a deciduous shrub that exhibits characteristics of both raspberries and blackberries. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, with thorny stems and compound leaves that have serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are usually red or black in color, containing multiple seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for cultivation in temperate climates. Botanically, it is a result of natural or artificial crossbreeding between species within the Rubus genus."
