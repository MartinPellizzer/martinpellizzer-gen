    "intro": "Rhynchospora rubra f. elata, commonly known as the elevated red beakgrass, is a botanical variant of the red beakgrass species. It is a perennial herbaceous plant native to certain regions of North America, particularly in wetland or marshy habitats. The plant is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, reddish-purple flowers that bloom in late summer. Its foliage is typically narrow and grass-like, with a dense growth habit that helps it thrive in moist environments. This form is distinguished by its slightly elevated inflorescence compared to the typical form of Rhynchospora rubra."
