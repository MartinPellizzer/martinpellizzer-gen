    "intro": "Rosa praetincta, commonly known as the purpleleaf rose, is a species of flowering shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive deep purple foliage, which contrasts strikingly with its pink to white flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters and features thorny stems covered in soft, glandular hairs. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, producing a fragrant, single-layered bloom. Rosa praetincta is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique leaf color and delicate floral display."
