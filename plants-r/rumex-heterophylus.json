    "intro": "Rumex heterophylus, commonly known as the variable dock, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its variable leaf morphology, with some leaves being broad and others narrow, depending on the environment. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their astringent properties. The species is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a range of soil conditions."
