    "intro": "Royena cuneata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed rosywood, is a small evergreen shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of pink and white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a desirable plant for garden use. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sun, thriving in moist, acidic conditions."
