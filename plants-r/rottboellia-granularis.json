    "intro": "Rottboellia granularis, commonly known as the rough-seeded grass or granular panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, erect stems that often produce dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. The leaves are typically narrow and hairy, with a rough texture that gives the plant its common name. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands, roadsides, and agricultural fields. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping due to its hardy nature and ability to withstand various environmental conditions."
