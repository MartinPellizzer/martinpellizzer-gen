    "intro": "Ramonda floribunda, commonly known as the mountain bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in well-drained, sunny environments. The plant features basal rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of bell-shaped blue or violet flowers in late spring to early summer. Its flowers are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Ramonda floribunda is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or alpine settings."
