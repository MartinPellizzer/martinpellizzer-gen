    "intro": "Rubus putneiensis, commonly known as the Putneian blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the Carpathian Mountains in Romania. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves, typical of the Rubus genus. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are edible and have a tart flavor. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forested areas. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant in its native habitat."
