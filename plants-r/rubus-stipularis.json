    "intro": "Rubus stipularis, commonly known as the stipular rose or small-fruited blackberry, is a species of bramble native to parts of Asia and the Americas. It is characterized by its thorny stems, compound leaves, and small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black in color. The plant produces white to pale pink flowers, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions."
