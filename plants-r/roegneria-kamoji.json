    "intro": "Roegneria kamoji, commonly known as the Japanese meadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to East Asia. It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant typically features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences. Roegneria kamoji is often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in gardens, though it is primarily valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting biodiversity."
