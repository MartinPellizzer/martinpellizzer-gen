    "intro": "Rubus nemorosus var. ritschlii, commonly known as the Alpine blackberry, is a variant of the common bramble found in alpine regions. It is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit, with thorny stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically edible. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within the Rubus genus."
