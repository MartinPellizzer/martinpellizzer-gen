    "intro": "Rubia cordifolia var. coriacea, commonly known as rough heartleaf rubia, is a variant of the genus Rubia native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its rough, hairy leaves that are typically heart-shaped, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, violet-blue flowers that bloom in summer, and its roots are often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. The variant is distinguished by its more robust and textured foliage compared to the typical form of Rubia cordifolia."
