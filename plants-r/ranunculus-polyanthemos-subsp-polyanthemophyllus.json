    "intro": "Ranunculus polyanthemos subsp. polyanthemophyllus, commonly known as the showy buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features upright, branched stems that bear a dense array of small, bright yellow flowers with five to nine petals. The leaves are deeply divided into lobes, often with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. This subspecies is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 2.5 cm in diameter. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes."
