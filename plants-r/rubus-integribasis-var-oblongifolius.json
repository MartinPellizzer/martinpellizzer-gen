It is characterized by its large, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and have a slightly serrated edge. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by edible blackberries in the summer. Its growth habit is shrub-like, with thorny stems and a dense, sprawling form. The botanical features of this plant make it well adapted to a variety of soil types and environmental conditions."
