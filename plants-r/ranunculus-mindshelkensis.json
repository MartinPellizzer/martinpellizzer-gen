The plant features palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, and its flowers typically have five petals, often in shades of yellow or white. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is adapted to cool, temperate climates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
