    "intro": "Rhinanthus ellipticus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved yellowtop, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family, which includes various parasitic and hemiparasitic species. This plant is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. It grows in open habitats such as grasslands, woodland edges, and disturbed soils. Rhinanthus ellipticus is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from the roots of other plants while also performing photosynthesis."
