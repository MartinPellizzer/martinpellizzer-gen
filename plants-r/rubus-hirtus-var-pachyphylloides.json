    "intro": "Rubus hirtus var. pachyphylloides, commonly known as the thick-leaved bramble, is a shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its stout, thorny stems and large, broad leaves that are often hairy on the upper surface. The plant produces white to pale pink flowers in the spring, followed by edible, red berries in the summer. It thrives in moist, woodland habitats and is often found in the understory of deciduous forests. Its thick, leathery leaves give it its botanical variant name, pachyphylloides, meaning \"thick-leaved.\""
