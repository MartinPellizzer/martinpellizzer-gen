    "intro": "Rosa glauca f. subbiserrata, commonly known as the blue rose with subbiserrate leaves, is a botanical variant of the Rosa glauca species. It is characterized by its pale blue to white flowers, which are typically smaller than those of the typical Rosa glauca. The leaves of this form have a distinctive subbiserrate margin, meaning they are finely toothed along the edges. It is native to regions of Central Asia and is often found in rocky or mountainous habitats. This cultivar is valued for its unique coloration and ornamental appeal in horticulture."
