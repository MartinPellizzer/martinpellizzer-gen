    "intro": "Rheum undulatum, commonly known as the undulating rhubarb, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its large, arrow-shaped leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in length, and its clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant belongs to the Polygonaceae family, which includes other well-known species like buckthorn and sorrel. Its rhubarb-like stems are edible but are typically not consumed due to their high oxalic acid content. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
