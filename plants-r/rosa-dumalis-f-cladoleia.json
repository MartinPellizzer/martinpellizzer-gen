    "intro": "Rosa dumalis f. cladoleia, commonly known as the clustered wild rose, is a compact, shrub-like form of the species Rosa dumalis. It is characterized by its dense, thornless growth habit and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of pink to white. The plant produces oval, dark green leaves with serrated edges, and its stems are often covered in a woolly, greyish pubescence. Native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Europe, it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens or as a hedge due to its hardy nature."
