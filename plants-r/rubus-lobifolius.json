    "intro": "Rubus lobifolius, commonly known as the alpine blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with lobed margins, which give it its scientific name. The plant produces small, dark red berries that are typically harvested in late summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing food for wildlife and stabilizing soil in rocky areas."
