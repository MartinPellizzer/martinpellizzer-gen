    "intro": "Rosa eglanteria f. densa, commonly known as the dense thorned rose, is a compact shrub characterized by its dense, thorny stems and dark green, ovate leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, white to pale pink flowers in late spring to early summer. Its foliage remains evergreen in mild climates, adding year-round interest to gardens. The dense growth habit makes it suitable for hedging or as a decorative plant in smaller spaces. It is native to regions of Europe and is valued for its ornamental qualities and hardy nature."
