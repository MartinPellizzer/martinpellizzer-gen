    "intro": "Randalia fistulosa, commonly known as the redroot false nettle, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, wooded areas and has opposite, heart-shaped leaves with a reddish underside. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are followed by tiny, bladder-like fruits. It has a fibrous root system that can spread widely, making it somewhat invasive in certain regions. The plant is often mistaken for true nettles due to its similar appearance and stinging hairs."
