    "intro": "Rapanea kwangsiensis var. lanceolata, commonly known as the Guangxi lanceleaf rapanea, is a rare evergreen shrub native to China. It belongs to the family Lauraceae, which includes laurels and cinnamon trees. The plant is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are glossy and dark green, often with a subtle aromatic scent. It typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, preferring well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable but endangered species in its native region."
