It is characterized by its clusters of small, bright purple berries that appear in late summer. The plant has glossy, dark green leaves that provide a striking contrast to its colorful fruits. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is relatively low maintenance. The berries are often used in ornamental gardening due to their visual appeal and are also edible in small quantities."
