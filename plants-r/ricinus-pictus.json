    "intro": "Ricinus pictus, commonly known as the cup plant, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often adorned with white markings. The plant produces distinctive cup-shaped seed pods that enclose its seeds, which are dispersed when the pods dry and split open. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in prairies and woodland edges. Ricinus pictus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators."
