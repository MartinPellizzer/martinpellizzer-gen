It belongs to the Polygonaceae family, characterized by its distinctive leaf shapes and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant features heart-shaped or broadly ovate leaves with a serrated margin and a reddish or purple stem. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its leaves are often used in traditional herbal medicine and as a culinary herb due to their tart, sour flavor."
