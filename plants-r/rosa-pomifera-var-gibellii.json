    "intro": "Rosa pomifera var. gibellii, commonly known as the giant rose or the rose of the mountains, is a unique and rare species native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. This plant is characterized by its large, woody stems and its ability to produce massive, fleshy fruits that can weigh several kilograms. The leaves are typically compound, with a serrated edge, and the flowers are usually pink or white, blooming in early summer. It is adapted to cold climates and can thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered an endangered species in its native range."
