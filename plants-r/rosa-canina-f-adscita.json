    "intro": "Rosa canina f. adscita, commonly known as the dog rose form adscita, is a botanical variant of the dog rose, characterized by its distinct floral and foliage features. This form exhibits a more compact growth habit compared to the typical Rosa canina, with smaller, more densely packed flowers. The leaves are usually more serrated and have a slightly different coloration than the standard species. It is often found in similar habitats, such as woodland edges and disturbed soils, where it thrives in partial shade. Botanically, it is notable for its ornamental value and its role in supporting local pollinators."
