    "intro": "Ranunculus rubrocalyx, commonly known as the red-calyx buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the western United States. It features delicate, palmately divided leaves and showy, yellow flowers with a distinctive red calyx. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and streambanks. It blooms from late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
