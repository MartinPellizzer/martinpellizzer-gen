    "intro": "Ranunculus mucronatus, commonly known as the prickly poppy, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often with a distinctive dark center. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves and produces small, hairy seeds in a showy, spherical seed head. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or disturbed habitats. Ranunculus mucronatus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant blooms."
