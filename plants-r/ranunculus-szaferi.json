    "intro": "Ranunculus szaferi, commonly known as the Szafer's buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family, characterized by its showy, often brightly colored flowers. The plant features palmately divided leaves and produces flowers with five to eight petal-like sepals. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its alpine habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
