    "intro": "Racinaea insularis var. latilamina, commonly known as the Island Racinaea, is a rare and unique fern species native to specific tropical regions. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that exhibit a striking variegation pattern. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in dense forest undergrowth. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly across the forest floor. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
