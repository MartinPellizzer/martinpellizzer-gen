    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 chassagnei, commonly known as the Chassagne blackberry, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Rubus ursinus (the American blackberry) and Rubus glaucus (the Chilean blackberry). It is characterized by its thorny stems and dark purple to black berries that are typically larger and more flavorful than those of its parent species. The plant thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its high-quality fruit. It requires well-drained soil and full sun to produce optimal yields. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for both commercial and home gardening."
