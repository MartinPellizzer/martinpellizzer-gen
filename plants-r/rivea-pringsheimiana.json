    "intro": "Rivea pringsheimiana, commonly known as the purple morning glory, is a climbing vine native to South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, velvety leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of purple and white. The plant produces edible, fleshy fruits that contain seeds, though the fruit is often consumed when immature. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires support for its vigorous growth. The flowers open in the morning and close at dusk, giving it its common name."
