    "intro": "Rupicapnos speciosa, commonly known as the showy rockcress, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped, dark green leaves with a waxy coating. The plant produces striking clusters of bright yellow flowers in early spring, which are borne on slender, branching stems. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and unique appearance, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
