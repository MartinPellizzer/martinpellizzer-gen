    "intro": "Retinodendron scortechinii, commonly known as the red-flowered retinodendron, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family, characterized by its small, clustered flowers and woody structure. The plant is notable for its vibrant red petals, which contrast with its dark green foliage, making it a visually appealing species. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Retinodendron scortechinii is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
