    "intro": "Rosa tomentella var. laciniosa, commonly known as the fringed shrub rose, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and small, ovate leaves that are covered in a soft, woolly layer of grayish-white hairs. The flowers are typically pink to red, appearing in clusters and blooming in late spring to early summer. This variety is adapted to harsh, alpine environments and is often found in rocky soils at high elevations. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and is occasionally cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and full sun."
