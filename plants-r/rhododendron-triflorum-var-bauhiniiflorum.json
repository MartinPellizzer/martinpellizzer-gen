    "intro": "Rhododendron triflorum var. bauhiniiflorum, commonly known as the dwarf rhododendron, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It features small, leathery leaves that are dark green and glossy, typically arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, fragrant flowers in shades of pink to red, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often cultivated in horticultural settings."
