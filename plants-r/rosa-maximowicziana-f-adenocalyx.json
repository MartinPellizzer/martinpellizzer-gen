    "intro": "Rosa maximowicziana f. adenocalyx, commonly known as the pink sandalwood rose, is a unique floral variant characterized by its distinctive pinkish-red petals. This form is a naturally occurring foliage variant of the species Rosa maximowicziana, which is native to the Far East, including regions of China and Korea. The plant typically grows as a shrub with thorny stems and produces fragrant flowers in late spring to early summer. Its foliage is notable for its dense, dark green leaves with a slightly hairy texture. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not as widely recognized as other rose species."
