    "intro": "Rubus leptostelechus, commonly known as the slender-stemmed blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is characterized by its thorny stems, trifoliate leaves, and small, aggregate fruits that mature to a dark purple or black color. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and along stream banks. Its flowers are usually white or pale green, and it produces edible berries that are often used in local culinary traditions. The species is also valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and wildlife."
