    "intro": "Rhus villosa, commonly known as smooth sumac, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern and central United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically arranged in pairs along the stems, and its clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in the spring. The plant produces red, fuzzy berries that are a food source for birds and other wildlife. Rhus villosa thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in open woodlands, fields, and disturbed soils. Its adaptability and ornamental features make it a common sight in many natural habitats."
