    "intro": "Ranunculus sibthorpii, commonly known as the Sibthorp's buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features bright yellow flowers with five to eight petals, typically surrounded by a ring of yellow sepals. The plant has finely divided, trifoliate leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
