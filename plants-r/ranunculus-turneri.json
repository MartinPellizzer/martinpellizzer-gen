    "intro": "Ranunculus turneri, commonly known as the desert buttercup, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its delicate, bright yellow flowers with five petals and a hairy, glandular stem. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and has a low, spreading growth habit. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a rough texture and often covered in fine hairs. Ranunculus turneri is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through deep root systems and water-storing tissues."
