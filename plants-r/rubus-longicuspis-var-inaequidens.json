    "intro": "Rubus longicuspis var. inaequidens, commonly known as the unequal-toothed blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, unevenly shaped bracts and dark purple to black berries. The plant typically grows in moist, wooded areas and thrives in partial to full shade. Its leaves are usually compound, with three to five leaflets, and the flowers are small, white, and clustered in dense inflorescences. This variant is valued for its hardy nature and is often found in the wild, though it is less commonly cultivated than other blackberry species."
