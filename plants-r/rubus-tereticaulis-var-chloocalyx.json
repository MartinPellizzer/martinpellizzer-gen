    "intro": "Rubus tereticaulis var. chloocalyx, commonly known as the green-leaf blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant characterized by its distinctive foliage. It is native to the southeastern United States, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant produces small, dark berries that are typically less palatable than those of other blackberry varieties. Its leaves are broad and have a smooth, waxy texture, which helps in retaining moisture. The flowers are usually white or pale pink, and they appear in clusters, contributing to the plant's ornamental value."
