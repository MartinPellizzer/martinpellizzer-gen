    "intro": "Rhus angustiarum, commonly known as narrowleaf sumac, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are composed of 11 to 23 narrow, linear leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring, followed by red, fuzzy berries that attract birds and other wildlife. Its roots are deep and drought-tolerant, allowing it to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, improving soil fertility in degraded areas."
