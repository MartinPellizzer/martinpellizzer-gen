    "intro": "Rubus bagnallii, commonly known as Bagnall's bramble, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of southern China, particularly in Yunnan Province. The plant is characterized by its thorny stems, trifoliate leaves, and small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring. Its fruits are aggregate berries, typically red when mature, and are adapted for dispersal by birds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Rubus bagnallii is considered a rare and endangered species."
