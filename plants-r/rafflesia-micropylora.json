    "intro": "Rafflesia micropylora, commonly known as the small-pelted rafflesia, is a parasitic flowering plant found in the rainforests of Borneo. It is notable for its large, reddish-orange flowers that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The plant lacks leaves, stems, and roots, relying entirely on its host vine for nutrients. Its flowers emit a strong, foul odor reminiscent of decaying flesh to attract pollinators like flies and beetles. Due to habitat loss, Rafflesia micropylora is considered endangered and is a symbol of the unique biodiversity of Southeast Asian rainforests."
