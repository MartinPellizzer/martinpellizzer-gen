The plant is notable for its robust growth habit and adaptability to various soil types, making it a resilient species in diverse environments. Its leaves are compound, with serrated edges, and the fruit, known as a hip, is a characteristic red, fuzzy capsule that contains seeds. This form is often appreciated for its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine."
