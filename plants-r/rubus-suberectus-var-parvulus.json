    "intro": "Rubus suberectus var. parvulus, commonly known as the dwarf bramble, is a shrub native to parts of eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, with slender, thorny stems that are often prostrate or semi-upright. The leaves are trifoliate, with three oval to lance-shaped leaflets, and are covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are small, white, and clustered in the axils of the leaves, followed by red, hairy berries. This species is often found in moist woodlands and along stream banks, where it thrives in partial shade."
