    "intro": "Rosa sempervirens f. scandens, commonly known as the creeping pink rose, is a compact, low-growing shrub with dense, thornless stems that form a mat-like growth. It features small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink to white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has glossy, dark green leaves that are oval-shaped and arranged alternately along the stems. It is well-suited for rock gardens, borders, or as a ground cover due to its spreading habit. Native to southern Europe, it thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade."
