    "intro": "Rhus apiculata, commonly known as the smooth sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern and central United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and turn bright red in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are followed by orange-red, fuzzy fruit clusters. Rhus apiculata thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in dry, sandy soils. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in disturbed areas."
