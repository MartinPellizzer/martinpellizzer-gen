    "intro": "Rubus platybelus, commonly known as the flat-stemmed bramble, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is native to parts of Europe and Asia, typically growing in woodland areas and along stream banks. The plant is characterized by its trailing growth habit, with thorny stems and trifoliate leaves. Its flowers are usually white or pink, and it produces edible berries that are often used in jams and preserves. However, due to its invasive nature in some regions, it can pose a challenge to local ecosystems."
