    "intro": "Rumex sanguineus, commonly known as red sorrel, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features alternate, ovate leaves with a reddish or purple underside, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist, shady environments. The leaves are often used in cooking, though they should be cooked to reduce their tart flavor and potential oxalic acid content."
