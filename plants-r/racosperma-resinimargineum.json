    "intro": "Racosperma resinimargineum, commonly known as the resinous wattle, is a shrub native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its yellow floral spikes and glandular, resin-secreting leaves. The plant belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is known for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia. Its unique resinous margins on the leaves give it a distinct appearance and contribute to its ecological role in nutrient cycling. The species is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it resilient to drought conditions."
