    "intro": "Rubus subhercynus, commonly known as the Hercynian blackberry, is a species of brambles native to Central and Eastern Europe. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark red to black in color. It thrives in woodland edges and disturbed soils, often forming dense thickets. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
