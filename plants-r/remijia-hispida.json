    "intro": "Remijia hispida, commonly known as the wooly thistle, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its spiny, hairy leaves and purple to pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid conditions. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Remijia hispida is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
