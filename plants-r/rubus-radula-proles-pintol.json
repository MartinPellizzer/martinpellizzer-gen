    "intro": "Rubus radula proles pintol, commonly known as the coastal bramble, is a shrub native to coastal regions of the Pacific Northwest. It is characterized by its thorny stems and trifoliate leaves, which are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, white to pink flowers in the spring, followed by edible berries that are popular among birds and small mammals. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to salt spray and strong winds. Its botanical features make it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
