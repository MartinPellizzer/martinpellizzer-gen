It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that are typically clustered in racemes. The plant produces elongated, bean-like pods that contain several seeds. It is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and waste areas. Rhynchosia malacophylla is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil enrichment."
