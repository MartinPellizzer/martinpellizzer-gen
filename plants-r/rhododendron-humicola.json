    "intro": "Rhododendron humicola, commonly known as the dwarf alpine rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of East Asia, particularly in China, Korea, and Japan. It is a low-growing evergreen shrub characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and clusters of bell-shaped flowers. The plant thrives in cool, moist, acidic soils and is often found in high-altitude forests and alpine meadows. Its leaves are typically dark green and leathery, while its flowers range from pink to red, often blooming in early spring. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive species, making it a valuable subject for botanical study and conservation efforts."
