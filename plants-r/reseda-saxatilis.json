    "intro": "Reseda saxatilis, commonly known as rock reseda, is a flowering plant native to rocky and coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Reseda saxatilis is often found in gravelly soils and is well-suited to coastal or maritime climates."
