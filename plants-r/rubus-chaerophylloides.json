    "intro": "Rubus chaerophylloides, commonly known as the alpine blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit, with thorny stems and compound leaves that are typically trifoliate. The plant produces small, dark purple to black fruits that are edible and have a tart flavor. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
