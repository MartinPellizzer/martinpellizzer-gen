    "intro": "Rubus hirtus var. spinulifolius, commonly known as the prickly blackberry, is a thorny shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features compound leaves with serrated edges and small, hooked bracts that aid in seed dispersal. The plant produces aggregate fruits composed of tiny, drupe-like berries that ripen to a dark red or black color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and thickets. Its botanical characteristics make it an important species for both ecological and horticultural studies."
