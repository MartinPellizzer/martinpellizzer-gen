    "intro": "Rosenbergia minor, commonly known as the dwarf cycad, is a small, slow-growing cycad native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its short, stout trunk and a crown of feathery, compound leaves that resemble those of a palm. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of cycads. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil. Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens."
