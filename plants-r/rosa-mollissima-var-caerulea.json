    "intro": "Rosa mollissima var. caerulea, commonly known as the blue rose or blue musk rose, is a hybrid rose species native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its soft, velvety foliage and its striking, pale blue to lavender-colored flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub, reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters, with thornless stems and a compact, bushy form. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, producing a delicate, almost ethereal fragrance. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique color and aesthetic appeal."
