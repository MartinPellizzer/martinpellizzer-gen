    "intro": "Rhodiola heterodonta, commonly known as the Tibetan rhodiola, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas and Central Asia. It is characterized by its fleshy, reddish roots and upright, branched stems that bear small, yellowish flowers. The plant thrives in cold, arid environments and is adapted to extreme altitudes, often growing above 3,000 meters. Its leaves are typically linear and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Rhodiola heterodonta is valued for its medicinal properties and is used in traditional medicine for its purported adaptogenic and antidepressant effects."
