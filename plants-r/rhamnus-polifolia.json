    "intro": "Rhamnus polifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its simple, opposite, and often elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by black, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Rhamnus polifolia is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to tolerate various environmental conditions."
