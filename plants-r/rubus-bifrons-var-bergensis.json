    "intro": "Rubus bifrons var. bergensis, commonly known as the Bergens raspberry, is a variant of the common bramble found primarily in northern regions. It is characterized by its biennial growth habit, with flowering occurring on the previous year's wood. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or black in color, containing several druplets. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in forested areas or along streambanks. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
