    "intro": "Rhododendron chionanthum, commonly known as the snow-flower rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia, particularly China. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of white to pale pink flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in shady, moist environments, often in forest understories where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its leaves are leathery and oval-shaped, providing a striking contrast to the delicate floral display. This species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to add a refined, ethereal touch to gardens."
