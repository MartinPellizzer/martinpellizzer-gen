    "intro": "Rigiolepis suberosa, commonly known as the roughleaf dandelion, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disc flowers. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and meadows. Its leaves are rough and hairy, with a distinctive lobed shape, and it produces a yellow flower that develops into a fluffy seed head. The plant is often considered a weed but has historical uses in traditional medicine."
