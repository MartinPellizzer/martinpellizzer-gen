    "intro": "Remirea distichophylla, commonly known as the two-veined fern, is a unique member of the Osmundaceae family, characterized by its primitive and ancient morphology. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features a rhizomatous stem with bipinnate fronds that have a distinctive two-veined structure, contributing to its scientific name. Its spore-bearing structures, called sporangia, are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a feature common in ferns. Remirea distichophylla is notable for its evolutionary significance, representing a lineage that dates back to the Mesozoic era."
