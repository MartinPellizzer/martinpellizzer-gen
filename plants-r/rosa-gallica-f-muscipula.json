    "intro": "Rosa gallica f. muscipula, commonly known as the sticky rose or the sticky musk rose, is a unique horticultural form of the Gallica rose. It is characterized by its dense, glandular hairs that give the stems and leaves a sticky texture, which can trap small insects. The plant produces deep pink to red flowers with a strong, musky fragrance, typical of the Rosa gallica species. It is a compact shrub that thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often used in rock gardens or as a decorative plant. Due to its ornamental value and unique characteristics, it is a sought-after plant among gardeners and botanists alike."
