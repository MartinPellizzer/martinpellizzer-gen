    "intro": "Ryssopterys discolor, commonly known as the variegated fern, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that display a striking pattern of green and white. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to form dense colonies over time. Ryssopterys discolor is often cultivated for its ornamental value and air-purifying properties."
