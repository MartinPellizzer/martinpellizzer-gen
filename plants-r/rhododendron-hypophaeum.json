    "intro": "Rhododendron hypophaeum, commonly known as the dwarf rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Asia, particularly in China, Korea, and Japan. It is a compact evergreen shrub characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and clusters of bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in acidic, well-drained soils and thrives in shaded to partially sunny conditions. Its botanical features include showy inflorescences and a generally low-growing habit, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Rhododendron hypophaeum is also valued for its ecological role in supporting local insect and bird populations."
