    "intro": "Rhododendron kiyosumense f. glabrescens, commonly known as the Kiyosumi glabrous rhododendron, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to Japan. It features dense, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and slightly glossy. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to white, which bloom in early spring. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens or as a container plant. The f. glabrescens form is distinguished by its reduced pubescence, giving it a smoother appearance compared to the typical form."
