    "intro": "Ranunculus hirsutus var. parvulus, commonly known as the hairy buttercup, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features delicate, palmately lobed leaves covered in fine, silky hairs, which give it its common name. The plant produces bright yellow flowers with 5 to 13 petals, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and woodland edges. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
