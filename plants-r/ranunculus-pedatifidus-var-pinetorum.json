    "intro": "Ranunculus pedatifidus var. pinetorum, commonly known as the pine forest buttercup, is a variant of the broad-leaved buttercup native to coniferous forest regions. It is characterized by its distinctive, deeply lobed leaves that resemble a dissected leaf blade, often with a silvery underside. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, forested areas. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
