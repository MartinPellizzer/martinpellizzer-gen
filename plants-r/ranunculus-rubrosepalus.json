    "intro": "Ranunculus rubrosepalus, commonly known as the red-sepal buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features delicate, palmately divided leaves and showy, bright yellow flowers with red sepals that distinguish it from other buttercup species. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It blooms from late spring to early summer, producing clusters of flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens but is considered rare in the wild."
