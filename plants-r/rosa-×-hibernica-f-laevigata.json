    "intro": "Rosa \u00d7 hibernica f. laevigata, commonly known as the smooth-stemmed hybrid rose, is a botanical variant characterized by its smooth, hairless stems and compact growth habit. It is a natural hybrid between Rosa hibernica and Rosa canina, resulting in a plant that exhibits traits from both parents. The leaves are typically oval with a slightly serrated margin, and the flowers are usually pink to red, with a strong, sweet fragrance. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and hardy nature, thriving in a range of soil conditions. It is particularly valued in horticulture for its resilience and aesthetic appeal in gardens and landscapes."
