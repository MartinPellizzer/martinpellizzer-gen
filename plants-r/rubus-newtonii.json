    "intro": "Rubus newtonii, commonly known as Newton's blackberry, is a species of brambles native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is characterized by its thorny stems, trifoliate leaves, and dark purple to black berries that ripen in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its flowers are white and clustered in heads, and the berries are often used in local foraging traditions. Rubus newtonii plays an important ecological role by providing food for wildlife and supporting local biodiversity."
