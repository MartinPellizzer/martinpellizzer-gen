    "intro": "Rhinanthus freynii var. sterneckii, commonly known as the yellow rattle, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant that belongs to the Orobanchaceae family. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. The plant has a slender, branched stem and small, lance-shaped leaves. It grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and heathlands, often in areas with poor soil. Its parasitic nature allows it to draw nutrients from the roots of other plants, which can influence the composition of the local vegetation."
