    "intro": "Ricinus communis var. amblyocalyx, commonly known as the narrow-leaf castor, is a variant of the castor oil plant characterized by its narrower leaves compared to the typical castor. It is a flowering plant in the spurge family, Euphorbiaceae, and is native to tropical regions of Africa. The plant produces distinctive spiny capsules that contain toxic seeds, which are used in traditional medicine and as a source of castor oil. Its growth habit includes both annual and perennial forms, depending on the climate, and it thrives in warm, humid environments."
