    "intro": "Ranunculus monophyllus subsp. parvulifrons, commonly known as the small-leaved crowfoot, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a basal rosette of leaves that are deeply lobed and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
