    "intro": "Rumex subrotundus, commonly known as broadleaf sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features oval to kidney-shaped leaves with a distinctive waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats."
