    "intro": "Rosa chlorophylla bicolor, commonly known as the twin-chlorophyll rose, is a rare and unique species characterized by its unusual chlorophyll distribution. Its leaves exhibit a striking dichotomy, with one side displaying normal green pigmentation and the other appearing pale or yellow due to reduced chlorophyll content. This phenomenon is believed to result from a genetic mutation affecting chloroplast development. The plant's flowers are typically pink to white, with a subtle fragrance that is less intense than in most roses. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded woodland areas."
