    "intro": "Rubus fissus f. pseudoplicatus, commonly known as the false-leaf blackberry, is a horticultural form of the blackberry plant. It is characterized by its unique foliage, which features leaves that are deeply lobed and sometimes resemble the appearance of folded leaves. This cultivar is prized for its dark purple to black berries, which are often larger and more flavorful than those of the standard Rubus fissus. The plant is typically grown in temperate climates and requires well-drained soil and full sun for optimal growth. It is a popular choice for home gardeners and commercial growers due to its hardiness and productivity."
