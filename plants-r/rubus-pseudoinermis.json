    "intro": "Rubus pseudoinermis, commonly known as the soft-hairy blackberry, is a species of bramble native to North America. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and thornless stems, which distinguish it from many other Rubus species. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically eaten by wildlife and birds. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
