It is characterized by its slender, twining stems and large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by orange-red berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in some tropical gardens for its foliage and floral display."
