    "intro": "Rosa montana f. typica, commonly known as the mountain rose, is a compact shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America. It features dense, thorny stems and clusters of fragrant, semi-double pink flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has dark green, leathery leaves that provide a striking contrast to its showy blooms. It is well adapted to rocky soils and can thrive in full sun to partial shade. Due to its hardy nature, it is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and resilience."
