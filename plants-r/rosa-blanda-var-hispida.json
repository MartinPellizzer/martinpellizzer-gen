    "intro": "Rosa blanda var. hispida, commonly known as the hairy woods rose, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It features slender, arching stems covered in fine, glandular hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink to white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a fuzzy texture due to the presence of trichomes. This species is well adapted to moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodland edges and stream banks."
