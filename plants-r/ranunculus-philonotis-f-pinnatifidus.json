    "intro": "Ranunculus philonotis f. pinnatifidus, commonly known as the pinnatifid buttercup, is a botanical variant of the broader Ranunculus philonotis species. It is characterized by its distinctive, deeply divided leaves that give it a fern-like appearance, which is a notable feature in its botanical classification. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with five petals, typical of the Ranunculaceae family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its unique foliage and delicate blooms make it a subject of interest in both horticulture and botanical studies."
