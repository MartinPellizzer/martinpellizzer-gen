    "intro": "Rhus velutina, commonly known as the smooth sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and turn vibrant red in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in panicles, followed by reddish-brown, spiny fruits that contain one or two seeds. Rhus velutina is adapted to a variety of soil types and thrives in full sun, making it a common sight in woodlands and along roadsides. Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and a useful plant for ornamental gardening."
