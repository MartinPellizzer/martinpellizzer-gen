    "intro": "Rubus pyramidalis f. nemorosus, commonly known as the shrub raspberry or forest raspberry, is a botanical variant of the raspberry plant native to eastern North America. It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its erect, often thorny stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or yellow in color, resembling those of other Rubus species. It thrives in woodland habitats, often growing in partial shade and well-drained soil. This ferny-leafed form is notable for its ornamental value and its role in supporting local wildlife."
