    "intro": "Rubus moluccanus var. glabriusculus, commonly known as the smooth-stemmed blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous stems and leaves, which distinguish it from other Rubus species. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically harvested when fully ripe. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists."
