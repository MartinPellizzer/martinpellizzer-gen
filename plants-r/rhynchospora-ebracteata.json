    "intro": "Rhynchospora ebracteata, commonly known as the bractless spike-rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and spike-like inflorescences that lack bracts. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, such as swamps and seasonally flooded areas. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually arranged in dense clusters, and it produces small, three-angled fruits. Rhynchospora ebracteata plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
