It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated, bract-like leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery-white down. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant pink flowers in early spring. Its stems are often woody and covered in a similar silvery bloom, contributing to its ornamental value. It is well-suited for rock gardens and prefers well-drained soil and full sun."
