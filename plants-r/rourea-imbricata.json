    "intro": "Rourea imbricata, commonly known as the velvetleaf rourea, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage that gives it its common name. The plant typically grows as an evergreen shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to elliptic in shape, and often have a waxy texture. Rourea imbricata produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in catkins, and it is often cultivated for its ornamental foliage rather than its blooms."
