    "intro": "Rumex bulbosus, commonly known as the bulbous dock, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a robust, fleshy root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, aiding in water retention. Its flowers are small and clustered in loose inflorescences, typically appearing in spring. Rumex bulbosus is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along roadsides, where it thrives in moist, temperate conditions."
