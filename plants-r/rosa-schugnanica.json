    "intro": "Rosa schugnanica, commonly known as the Schugnanica rose, is a rare and ancient species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its fragrant, single or semi-double pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has deeply lobed, dark green leaves with a slightly hairy texture. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows to a height of 1-2 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
