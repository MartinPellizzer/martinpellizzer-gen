    "intro": "Riedelia warszewiczii, commonly known as the Warszewicz's riedelia, is a rare and unique plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its delicate, hairy leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to cold, arid conditions. Its flowering period occurs during the warmer months, and it is often found in association with other alpine flora. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
