It features a basal rosette of hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapic gardens."
