    "intro": "Rosa corymbosa, commonly known as the Chinese rose, is a deciduous shrub native to China and Korea. It is characterized by its dense, thornless stems and clusters of fragrant, pink or white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. Its leaves are compound, consisting of five to seven oval-shaped leaflets with serrated edges. Rosa corymbosa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
