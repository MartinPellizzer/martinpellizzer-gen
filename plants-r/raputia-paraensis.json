    "intro": "Raputia paraensis, commonly known as the Paraense Raputia, is a flowering plant native to the Amazon rainforest of South America. It belongs to the family Cyclanthaceae and is characterized by its unique, showy inflorescences. The plant typically grows as a terrestrial herb with fleshy, tuberous roots that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are broad and often have a waxy surface to reduce water loss in the humid environment. Raputia paraensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its striking floral displays."
