    "intro": "Rosa crenulata, commonly known as the alpine rose, is a species of flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant produces prickly stems and heart-shaped leaves, which are typical of many rose species. Rosa crenulata thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its hardy nature allows it to survive in colder climates, contributing to its reputation as a resilient ornamental plant."
