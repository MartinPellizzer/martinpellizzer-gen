    "intro": "Rhododendron cloiophorum subsp. mannophorum, commonly known as the Sierra Madre rhododendron, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and showy, tubular flowers that bloom in spring. The subspecies is distinguished by its pale pink to lavender-colored petals and a unique floral structure that facilitates pollination by specific insect species. It thrives in cool, moist, acidic soils and is often found in cloud forests at elevations above 1,500 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
