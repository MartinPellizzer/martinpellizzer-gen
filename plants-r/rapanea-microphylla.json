    "intro": "Rapanea microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved evergreen or the Malagasy lauraceae, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically less than 2 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by dark purple to black berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
