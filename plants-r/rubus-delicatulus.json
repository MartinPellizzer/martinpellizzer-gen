    "intro": "Rubus delicatulus, commonly known as the delicate raspberry, is a species of bramble native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its slender, thornless stems and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces small, edible berries that are typically red or yellow in color, with a delicate flavor. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial shade, often found in forested areas. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
