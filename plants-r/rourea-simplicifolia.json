    "intro": "Rourea simplicifolia, commonly known as the simple-leaved rourea, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often glossy and elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, typically borne on short pedicels. Its growth habit is usually shrub-like, with a woody stem and dense foliage, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Rourea simplicifolia is also valued for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its relatively low maintenance requirements."
