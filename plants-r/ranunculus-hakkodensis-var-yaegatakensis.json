    "intro": "Ranunculus hakkodensis var. yaegatakensis, commonly known as the Yaegatakensis buttercup, is a rare and endemic species native to Japan. It is characterized by its delicate, yellow flowers with five petals and a central cluster of stamens. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as mountain forests and stream sides. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a hairy surface that helps retain moisture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
