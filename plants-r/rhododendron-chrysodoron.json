    "intro": "Rhododendron chrysodoron, commonly known as the golden-leaf rhododendron, is a species native to the Himalayas, particularly in regions of India and Nepal. It is characterized by its striking, broad, ovate leaves that are often a vibrant yellow-green in color, which stand out against its clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments at high altitudes, thriving in cool, humid climates. Its flowers, which bloom in spring, range in color from white to pink and are often fragrant. Rhododendron chrysodoron is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
