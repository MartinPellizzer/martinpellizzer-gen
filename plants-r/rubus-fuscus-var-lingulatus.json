    "intro": "Rubus fuscus var. lingulatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved blackberry, is a shrub native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dark purple to black berries, which are typically small and somewhat tart in flavor. The plant produces trifoliate leaves with narrow, lance-shaped leaflets, and its stems are often covered in dense, prickly hairs. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges or disturbed soils. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
