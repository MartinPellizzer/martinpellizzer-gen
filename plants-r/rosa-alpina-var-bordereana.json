    "intro": "Rosa alpina var. bordereana, commonly known as the Alpine rose or mountain rose, is a shrub native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white, pink, and red. The plant produces rose-shaped flowers with five petals and numerous stamens, typical of the Rosaceae family. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with serrated leaflets, and it is well adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. It is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and hardiness in cooler climates."
