    "intro": "Ranunculus obtusitectus, commonly known as the blunt-leaf buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features delicate, palmately divided leaves and showy, yellow flowers with numerous stamens. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine environments, preferring well-drained, rocky soils. Its flowers bloom in early to mid-summer, and it is often found in meadows and open slopes. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
