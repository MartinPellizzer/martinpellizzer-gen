    "intro": "Rhinanthus burnatii, commonly known as the lesser burnet, is a flowering plant belonging to the Scrophulariaceae family. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, bright red flowers that bloom from June to August. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and heaths, often in sunny locations. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it has a fibrous root system that helps it survive in poor soils. Rhinanthus burnatii is also known for its role in supporting pollinators, particularly bees, due to its abundant nectar-rich flowers."
