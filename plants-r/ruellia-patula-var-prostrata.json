    "intro": "Ruellia patula var. prostrata, commonly known as creeping bluebell, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the southern United States. It features slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, forming a dense mat of foliage. The plant produces small, tubular blue or violet flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. This variety is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in partial shade to full sun."
