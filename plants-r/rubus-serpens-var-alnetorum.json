    "intro": "Rubus serpens var. alnetorum, commonly known as the alnetum blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is a shrub that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland edges and stream banks. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are edible but often have a tart flavor. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the stems are covered in fine, stinging hairs. The botanical features of this variety make it an important species for both ecological studies and local horticulture."
