    "intro": "Richteria djilgense, commonly known as the Djilgense cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is adapted to grow in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered vulnerable to extinction."
