    "intro": "Rubus micans var. ischnus, commonly known as the silverleaf blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to parts of North America. It is characterized by its silvery-white undersides on its leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, dark purple berries that are typically harvested in late summer. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and somewhat rare subspecies within the Rubus genus."
