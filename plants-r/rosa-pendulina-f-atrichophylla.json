    "intro": "Rosa pendulina f. atrichophylla, commonly known as the velvety climbing rose, is a unique horticultural form of the species Rosa pendulina. It is characterized by its soft, velvety foliage that lacks the typical thorns found in many rose varieties. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink to white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It is a vigorous climber that thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for trellises and garden structures. Its ornamental value lies in its lush foliage and delicate floral display."
