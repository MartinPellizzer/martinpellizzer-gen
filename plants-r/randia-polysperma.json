It is a shrub that typically grows in coastal areas and saline environments, showcasing its adaptability to harsh conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, often followed by red, berry-like fruits. Its leaves are opposite and elliptical, with a rough texture that helps reduce water loss. Randia polysperma is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in coastal landscaping due to its salt tolerance."
