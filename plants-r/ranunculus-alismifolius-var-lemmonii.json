    "intro": "Ranunculus alismifolius var. lemmonii, commonly known as the Lemmon water crowfoot, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves that are divided into narrow, thread-like segments, resembling those of the water lily. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers with five petals, typically appearing in early spring. It thrives in shallow, still waters such as ponds and lakes, where it plays a role in aquatic ecosystems. Its botanical features make it an important indicator species for water quality and habitat health."
