    "intro": "Rhynchospora grayi var. harveyi, commonly known as Harvey's beakspur sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist to saturated soils. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of pale pink to reddish-brown flowers. Its inflorescence is distinctive, with the spikes bearing a beak-like structure at the base, which is a characteristic feature of the genus Rhynchospora. This variety is often found in association with other wetland plants, contributing to the ecological diversity of its habitat."
