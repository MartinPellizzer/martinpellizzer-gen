    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 chloophylloides, commonly known as the chlorophyllous raspberry, is a hybrid plant resulting from the crossbreeding of Rubus species. It exhibits enhanced chlorophyll content, leading to deeper green foliage compared to its parent plants. The plant typically grows as a shrub with thorny stems and compound leaves. Its flowers are usually pink or white, producing berries that are smaller than typical raspberries. This hybrid is valued for its improved photosynthetic efficiency and potential agricultural applications."
