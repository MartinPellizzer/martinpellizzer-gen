    "intro": "Rhododendron delicatulum, commonly known as the delicate rhododendron, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and clusters of fragrant, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in acidic, well-drained soils and thrives in shady, humid environments. It is often found in forest understories and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
