    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 semilacertosus, commonly known as the blackberry raspberry, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Rubus ursinus (the blackberry) and Rubus chamaemorus (the cloudberry). It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves, typical of the Rubus genus. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or orange in color, which are edible and have a tart flavor. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in wetlands or forested areas. Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits a range of morphological variations depending on its geographic location and genetic makeup."
