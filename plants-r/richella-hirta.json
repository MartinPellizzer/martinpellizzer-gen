    "intro": "Richella hirta, commonly known as the hairy richella, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. Its hairy leaves and yellowish flowers are adaptations to its harsh native habitat. Richella hirta is often found in open woodlands and along riverbanks, where it contributes to local biodiversity."
