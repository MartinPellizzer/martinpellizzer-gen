    "intro": "Rosa laccea, commonly known as the lacca rose, is a species of shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant produces rose hips, which are the fruit containing the seeds, and these are often used in traditional medicine. Rosa laccea thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Its ornamental value and medicinal properties make it a notable species in botanical gardens and herbal practices."
