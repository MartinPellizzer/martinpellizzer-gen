    "intro": "Rhamnus oleoides, commonly known as the common buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters and features small, oval-shaped leaves with a glossy green upper surface and a pale underside. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by dark purple berries that are rich in anthraquinones. Its root system is deep and can spread widely, making it a persistent weed in agricultural and disturbed areas. The plant is also valued for its medicinal properties, particularly in traditional herbal remedies."
