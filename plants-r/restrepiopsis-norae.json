    "intro": "Restrepiopsis norae, commonly known as the Andean mistflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous tiny florets. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, temperate climates. Its delicate, white to pale blue flowers bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
