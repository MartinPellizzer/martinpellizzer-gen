    "intro": "Rhus transvaalensis, commonly known as the Transvaal buckthorn, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Anacardiaceae family, which includes plants like the cashew and poison ivy. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves, which are usually odd-pinnate with serrated margins. Its small, yellowish-green flowers are followed by small, red berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. Rhus transvaalensis is often found in rocky areas and is adapted to arid or semi-arid conditions."
