The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in fields, along roadsides, and in wet meadows. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three heart-shaped leaflets, and the roots are hairy, giving it its common name. Ranunculus eriorrhizus is an annual herb that blooms from spring to early summer."
