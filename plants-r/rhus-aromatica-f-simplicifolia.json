    "intro": "Rhus aromatica f. simplicifolia, commonly known as smooth sumac, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern and central United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are made up of 10 to 30 pairs of oval, serrated leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in upright clusters, followed by red, fuzzy berries that are a common food source for birds. Its aromatic leaves and stems release a strong, resinous scent when crushed, which is a distinguishing feature. Smooth sumac thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in open woodlands and disturbed soils."
