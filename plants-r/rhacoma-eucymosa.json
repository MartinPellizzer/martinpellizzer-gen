    "intro": "Rhacoma eucymosa, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a member of the family Rubiaceae and is native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree that can grow up to 15 meters tall, characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and glossy, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by dark blue, berry-like fruits. Its wood is highly valued for its density, durability, and rich reddish color, making it a sought-after material in traditional crafts and furniture. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now classified as an endangered species."
