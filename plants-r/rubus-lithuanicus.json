    "intro": "Rubus lithuanicus, commonly known as Lithuanian blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the forests of Lithuania. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, dark purple to black fruits that are edible and have a tart flavor. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
