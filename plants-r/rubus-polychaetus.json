    "intro": "Rubus polychaetus, commonly known as the coastal blackberry, is a shrub native to coastal regions of western North America. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, dark red berries that are edible but often described as having a tart flavor. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to coastal climates with salt spray. Rubus polychaetus plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
