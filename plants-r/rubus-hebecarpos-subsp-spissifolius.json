    "intro": "Rubus hebecarpos subsp. spissifolius, commonly known as the dense-leaved blackberry, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its prickly stems and dark green, leathery leaves with a dense arrangement. The plant produces small, black berries that are typically edible and have a tart flavor. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in chaparral and woodland habitats. Its botanical features make it well adapted to the arid and semi-arid environments of its native range."
