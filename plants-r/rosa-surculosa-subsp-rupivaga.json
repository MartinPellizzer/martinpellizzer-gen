    "intro": "Rosa surculosa subsp. rupivaga, commonly known as the rock rose, is a perennial shrub native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of red or pink. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh, arid conditions of its native habitat. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, which helps reduce water loss in its native environment. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
