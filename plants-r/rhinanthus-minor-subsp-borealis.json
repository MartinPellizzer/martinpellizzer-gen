    "intro": "Rhinanthus minor subsp. borealis, commonly known as the northern yellow-rattle, is a flowering plant native to northern Europe and parts of Asia. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its specialized roots. The plant produces small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It typically grows in grasslands and open habitats, often in association with other flowering plants. Its ecological role includes supporting pollinators and contributing to the biodiversity of its environment."
