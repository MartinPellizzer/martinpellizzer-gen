It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes many aromatic herbs and vegetables. The plant is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that resemble those of an anemone, giving it its common name. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers bloom in clusters, typically in the summer months. Robertium anemonifolium is often found in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in cool, temperate climates."
