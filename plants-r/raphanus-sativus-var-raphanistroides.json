    "intro": "Raphanus sativus var. raphanistroides, commonly known as the wild radish, is a flowering plant in the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its stout, erect stems and pinnately lobed leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which are typically followed by spherical, pale purple or white siliques containing numerous seeds. It is native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia and is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. This variety is closely related to the cultivated radish but is less commonly grown for food."
