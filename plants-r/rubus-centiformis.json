    "intro": "Rubus centiformis, commonly known as the common blackberry bush, is a species of bramble native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces aggregate fruits, known as blackberries, which are typically dark purple to black in color. These fruits are edible, though they contain small seeds and are often consumed raw or used in jams and pies. Rubus centiformis thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands and along streambanks."
