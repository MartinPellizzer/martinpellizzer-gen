    "intro": "Ranunculus delacourii, commonly known as Delacour's buttercup, is a rare and striking member of the Ranunculaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in the Tian Shan and Pamir ranges. This perennial herb features showy, yellow flowers with deeply lobed petals and a central cluster of stamens. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is of particular interest to botanists and conservationists."
