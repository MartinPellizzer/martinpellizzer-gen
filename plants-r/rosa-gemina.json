    "intro": "Rosa gemina, commonly known as the twin rose, is a rare and delicate species of flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a slightly serrated edge, and its stems are covered in fine, soft hairs. Rosa gemina thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
