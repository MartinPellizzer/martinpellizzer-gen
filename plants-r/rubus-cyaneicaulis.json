    "intro": "Rubus cyaneicaulis, commonly known as the blue-stemmed blackberry, is a species of bramble native to western North America. It is characterized by its slender, blue-green stems and compound leaves with three to five leaflets. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers in early spring, which are followed by edible, dark purple berries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands and along streambanks. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
