    "intro": "Ranunculus repens f. polypetalus, commonly known as the creeping buttercup, is a variant of the common buttercup characterized by its distinctive, showy flowers. This plant is a low-growing perennial that thrives in moist, often shaded environments such as wet meadows and stream banks. Its flowers typically feature five to seven petals, which are larger and more elaborate than those of the typical Ranunculus repens. The leaves are trifoliate, with three deeply lobed leaflets, and the plant produces small, yellowish fruits that disperse via the wind. It is a member of the Ranunculaceae family, known for its diverse and often showy floral structures."
