It is characterized by its thorny stems, which provide structural support and defense against herbivores. The plant produces small, pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with serrated leaflets that are covered in fine hairs. This subspecies is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to Mediterranean climates."
