The plant is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. Its flowers are typically purple or blue, arranged in dense clusters at the ends of the stems. Rabdosia lasiocarpa is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories."
