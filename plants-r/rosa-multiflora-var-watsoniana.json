    "intro": "Rosa multiflora var. watsoniana, commonly known as the Watson's multiflora rose, is a deciduous shrub native to China. It is characterized by its fragrant, pink to white flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. The plant has arching stems with thorns and heart-shaped leaves that are serrated along the edges. It is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to form dense thickets. However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native plants."
