It features rounded, fleshy stems that are typically green to bluish-green in color. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are small, oval, and often covered in a fine, powdery coating. This variety is well-suited for rock gardens and arid environments due to its drought tolerance and ease of care."
