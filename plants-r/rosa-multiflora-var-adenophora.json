    "intro": "Rosa multiflora var. adenophora, commonly known as the\u817a\u82b1 Rosa or glandular flower rose, is a deciduous shrub native to East Asia. It is characterized by its multiple stems and dense foliage, with leaves that are pinnately compound and often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink to white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its ornamental value is enhanced by the presence of glandular hairs on the flower petals, which give it its botanical variant name. This species is also valued for its use in hedges and as a decorative plant in gardens."
