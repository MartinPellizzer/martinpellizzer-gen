    "intro": "Rubia cordata, commonly known as common madder, is a perennial herb native to Europe, western Asia, and north Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months. Its roots are the primary source of the red dye called madder, which has been used historically in textiles and medicine. Rubia cordata thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and grassy areas."
