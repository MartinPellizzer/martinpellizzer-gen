It features grass-like leaves and produces clusters of pale yellow to greenish flowers during the spring. The plant is characterized by its small, tuberous bulbs that store nutrients for the growing season. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is often cultivated for ornamental purposes."
