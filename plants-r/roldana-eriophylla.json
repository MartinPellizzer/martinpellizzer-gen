    "intro": "Roldana eriophylla, commonly known as the desert sunflower, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and other sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low water availability. Its leaves are usually covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss through transpiration. Roldana eriophylla produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
