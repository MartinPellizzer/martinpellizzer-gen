It features a compact, branching stem with thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a slight yellowish tint. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the warmer months. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil. Its unique appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
