    "intro": "Rubus bellatus, commonly known as the bellate blackberry, is a species of brambles native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and thorny stems, which are typical features of the Rubus genus. The plant produces aggregate fruits, commonly referred to as blackberries, which are typically dark purple to black in color when mature. Its leaves are compound, consisting of three to five oval-shaped leaflets, and are covered in fine hairs. The flowers are white and clustered in rounded inflorescences, adding to the plant's ornamental value."
