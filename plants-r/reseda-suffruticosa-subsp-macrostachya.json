    "intro": "Reseda suffruticosa subsp. macrostachya, commonly known as the large-stalked reseda, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in sunny, well-drained environments. The plant features upright stems that can reach up to 1 meter in height, covered with fine, hairy foliage. Its small, yellow flowers are arranged in dense, terminal clusters, and it produces capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used historically in dye production."
