    "intro": "Rosa montana var. staldensis, commonly known as the Staldens rose, is a compact shrub native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features dark green, leathery leaves that are densely arranged along its stems. The plant produces fragrant, semi-double pink flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its hardiness and ability to bloom repeatedly throughout the growing season."
