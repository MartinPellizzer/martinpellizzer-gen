    "intro": "Racosperma spooneri, commonly known as the narrow-leafed acacia, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Australia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, often zigzagging stems and bipinnate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in spherical inflorescences, followed by flat, pod-like fruits. It is well adapted to dry environments, with deep roots that allow it to access groundwater. Racosperma spooneri plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native wildlife."
