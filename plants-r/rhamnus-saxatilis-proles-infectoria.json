    "intro": "Rhamnus saxatilis proles infectoria, commonly known as the infectious bush or the disease-bearing shrub, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Rhamnaceae family. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically gray-green in color and have a rough texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by small, black berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine regions. Due to its limited distribution and potential toxicity, it is of interest to botanists and ecologists studying plant-pathogen interactions."
