    "intro": "Ribes integrifolium, commonly known as the smooth gooseberry, is a deciduous shrub native to North America. It is characterized by its simple, entire leaves that are typically oval to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by edible, round berries that mature to a dark red or black color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Ribes integrifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
