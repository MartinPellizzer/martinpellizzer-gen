    "intro": "Rhagodia parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved rhagodia, is a flowering plant native to southern Australia. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid regions, characterized by its compact form and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale pink flowers during the winter months, which attract a variety of pollinators. Its foliage is often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. Rhagodia parvifolia is well adapted to harsh environments and is often found in sandy soils."
