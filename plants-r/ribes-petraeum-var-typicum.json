    "intro": "Ribes petraeum var. typicum, commonly known as the rock gooseberry, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and thorny stems, which help it thrive in rocky and alpine environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by edible, tart berries that ripen in summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have serrated edges, contributing to its ornamental value. Ribes petraeum var. typicum is often used in horticulture for its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil in challenging terrains."
