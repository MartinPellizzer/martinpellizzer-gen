    "intro": "Rebutia aureiflora var. albiseta, commonly known as the white-flowered rebutia, is a compact cactus native to Mexico. It features a globular stem covered in short, woolly spines and produces clusters of bright yellow flowers during the spring. The plant is characterized by its pale green body and the absence of the typical orange coloration found in the standard variety. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated for its attractive blooms and unique appearance."
