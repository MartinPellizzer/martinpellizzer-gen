    "intro": "Ranunculus emersus, commonly known as the water crowfoot, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to freshwater habitats in Europe and Asia. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in ponds, streams, and ditches. The plant features finely divided, feathery leaves that float on the water surface or emerge from it, giving it its common name. Its flowers are usually yellow or white, with five to eight petals and numerous stamens, creating a showy appearance. Ranunculus emersus plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for aquatic invertebrates and waterfowl."
