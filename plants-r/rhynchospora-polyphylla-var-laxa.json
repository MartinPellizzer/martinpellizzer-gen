    "intro": "Rhynchospora polyphylla var. laxa, commonly known as the loose-leaved spikegrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh habitats in the southeastern United States. It features slender, erect stems that bear whorled clusters of small, pale green to brownish flowers. The leaves are linear and often have a hairy surface, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This variety is characterized by its loose arrangement of leaves compared to the typical form of R. polyphylla. It plays an important ecological role in supporting wetland biodiversity and is often found in association with other sedges and grasses."
