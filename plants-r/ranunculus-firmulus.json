    "intro": "Ranunculus firmulus, commonly known as the common mouse-ear, is a small herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in woodland edges. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves and produces delicate, yellow flowers with five petals. It blooms from late spring to early summer, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. Ranunculus firmulus is an important plant in ecological studies due to its role in supporting pollinators and its sensitivity to environmental changes."
