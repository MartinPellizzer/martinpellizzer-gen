    "intro": "Rubus hopingensis, commonly known as the Hope's blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its thorny stems and aggregate fruits. The plant produces dark purple to black berries that are often used in traditional Chinese medicine. Its leaves are palmately lobed, and the plant thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and less-studied species within the Rubus genus."
