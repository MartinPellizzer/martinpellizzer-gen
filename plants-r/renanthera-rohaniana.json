    "intro": "Renanthera rohaniana, commonly known as the Rohan's orchid, is a species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of red and pink. The plant has strap-like leaves and produces aerial roots, which help it climb and anchor itself to trees or other structures. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Renanthera rohaniana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts."
