    "intro": "Rubus macrophyllus var. commixtus, commonly known as the large-leaved blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves and thorny stems, which are typical features of the Rubus genus. The plant produces edible berries that are similar in taste to other blackberries but often have a slightly more tart flavor. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and thickets. This plant is valued for both its ornamental qualities and its fruit, which can be used in culinary applications."
