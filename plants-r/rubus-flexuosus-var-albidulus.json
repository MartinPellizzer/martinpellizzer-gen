    "intro": "Rubus flexuosus var. albidulus, commonly known as the white-flowered blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to parts of North America. It is characterized by its slender, arching stems and small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces small, tart berries that are typically less flavorful than those of other blackberry varieties. It thrives in woodland areas and prefers moist, well-drained soils. This variant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a source of edible fruit."
