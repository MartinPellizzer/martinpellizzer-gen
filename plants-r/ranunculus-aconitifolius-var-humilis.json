    "intro": "Ranunculus aconitifolius var. humilis, commonly known as the low-growing aconite leaf buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features delicate, nodding flowers with five deeply notched petals, typically in shades of white, yellow, or pale pink. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of soft, silky hairs. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and protected areas."
