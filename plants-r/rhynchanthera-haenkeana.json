    "intro": "Rhynchanthera haenkeana, commonly known as the yellow orchid, is a species of orchid native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often with a faintly fragrant scent. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments within tropical forests, where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the forest floor, and its leaves are broad and\u9769\u8d28, providing structural support. This orchid is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and greenhouses."
