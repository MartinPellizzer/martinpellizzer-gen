    "intro": "Rhopalocarpus parvifolius, commonly known as the small-leaved rhopalocarpus, is a member of the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod fruits. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and undergrowth. The plant has trifoliate leaves with three small, oval-shaped leaflets, and its flowers are typically small, clustered in racemes. Its seeds are enclosed in a long, slender pod that splits open upon maturity to release the seeds. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
