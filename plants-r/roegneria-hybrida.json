    "intro": "Roegneria hybrida, commonly known as the hybrid wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of Asia and North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are often hairy along the edges. The plant produces dense clusters of spikelets, which are typically blue to purple in color, contributing to its ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, making it suitable for gardens and landscapes. Roegneria hybrida is also valued for its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
