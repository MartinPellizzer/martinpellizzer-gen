It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, showcasing its adaptability to aquatic conditions. The plant features elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating, aiding in photosynthesis in waterlogged habitats. Its flowers are small and clustered in spikes, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants, a characteristic known as dioecious. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
