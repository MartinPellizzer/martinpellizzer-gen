    "intro": "Ribes uva-crispa var. glandulosum, commonly known as the glandular gooseberry, is a shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, yellowish-green berries. The leaves are alternate, ovate, and have serrated edges, often with a hairy texture. The plant produces flowers in early spring, typically white or pale green, which develop into the edible berries by summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable choice for ornamental gardens."
