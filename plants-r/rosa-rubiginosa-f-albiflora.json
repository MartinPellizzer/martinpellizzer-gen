    "intro": "Rosa rubiginosa f. albiflora, commonly known as the white-stemmed dog\u73ab\u7470, is a botanical variant of the Rosa rubiginosa species. It is characterized by its pale pink to white flowers, which contrast with its dark, woody stems. This plant is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in dry, sunny conditions. It has small, serrated leaves and produces fragrant blooms in late spring to early summer. The white-flowered form is less common than the typical red-flowered variety, making it a sought-after ornamental plant."
