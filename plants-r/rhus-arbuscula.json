    "intro": "Rhus arbuscula, commonly known as the dwarf sumac, is a small shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically arranged in pairs along the stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, fuzzy berries that persist into the winter. Rhus arbuscula thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands and along roadsides. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate poor soil conditions."
