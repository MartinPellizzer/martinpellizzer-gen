It is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its showy yellow-orange flower heads. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, thriving in moist to wet soil conditions. Its leaves are pinnately lobed, giving it a distinctive, feathery appearance. The plant produces seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its spread in suitable habitats."
