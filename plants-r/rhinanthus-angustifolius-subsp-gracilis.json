    "intro": "Rhinanthus angustifolius subsp. gracilis, commonly known as the slender yellow rattle, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, commonly referred to as the broomrape family, and is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers and parasitic growth habit. The plant lacks true leaves and instead absorbs nutrients from its host plants through specialized structures called haustoria. It typically grows in grassland habitats and is often found in association with grasses and other herbaceous plants. The slender yellow rattle is an important plant for pollinators and is considered a rare species in some regions."
