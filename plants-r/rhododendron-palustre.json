    "intro": "Rhododendron palustre, commonly known as the marsh rhododendron, is a deciduous shrub native to wetland and bog environments in northern regions. It features dark green, leathery leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and have a waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in acidic, nutrient-poor soils and requires consistent moisture. Rhododendron palustre plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and nectar for various pollinators."
