    "intro": "Robinia \u00d7 oconeensis, commonly known as the yellow poplar or Chinese parasol tree, is a hybrid deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its rapid growth rate, making it a popular choice for reforestation and ornamental planting. The tree features compound leaves with 15\u201330 oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces large, umbrella-shaped clusters of white flowers in the spring. Its fruit is a follicle that splits open to release winged seeds, aiding in its dispersal. The bark is smooth and light gray, with a distinctive flaky texture that becomes more pronounced with age."
