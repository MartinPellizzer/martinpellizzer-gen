    "intro": "Readea, commonly known as the golden trumpet vine, is a striking tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, pendulous yellow flowers that resemble trumpets, which bloom throughout the warmer months. The plant has heart-shaped, dark green leaves and can grow as a climbing vine or a shrub, depending on the conditions. Readea thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Its rapid growth and showy blooms make it both a beautiful and sometimes invasive species in non-native regions."
