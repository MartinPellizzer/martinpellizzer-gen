    "intro": "Rubus rupicola, commonly known as the rock raspberry, is a species of bramble native to the mountainous regions of North America. It is characterized by its woody stems and clusters of small, edible berries that ripen in the fall. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its leaves are typically trifoliate, with serrated edges, and its flowers are white or pale pink. Due to its habitat preferences, it plays an important role in stabilizing soil in rugged terrain."
