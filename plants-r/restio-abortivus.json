It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and a tall, slender stem that produces small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant is typically found in moist, sandy soils along coastal areas and riverbanks. Its growth habit is erect, and it often forms dense clumps. Restio abortivus is an important component of coastal vegetation, contributing to soil stabilization and habitat for various insects and small animals."
