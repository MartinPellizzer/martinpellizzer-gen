    "intro": "Rosa tomentella var. corymbosa, commonly known as the woolly rose or clustered woolly rose, is a shrub-like species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly grey foliage and small, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its stems are often covered in a thick layer of fine, white hairs, which help to reduce water loss in arid conditions. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
