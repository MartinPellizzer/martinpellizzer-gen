    "intro": "Rosa tomentosa subvar. lasioclada, commonly known as the woolly rose or silky bramble, is a shrub native to parts of Asia, including China and Japan. It is characterized by its dense, silvery-gray foliage covered in fine, soft hairs, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant pink to red flowers in late spring to early summer. Its stems are thorny and often covered with a fuzzy, woolly texture, contributing to its common name. This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal and hardy nature."
