    "intro": "Rosa canina f. vinealis, commonly known as the climbing dog rose, is a botanical variant of the common rose. It is characterized by its trailing stems that can climb or trail along the ground, making it suitable for hedging or ground cover. The plant produces small, pinkish-red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its hips, like those of Rosa canina, are edible and contain high levels of vitamin C. This form is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and hardy nature."
