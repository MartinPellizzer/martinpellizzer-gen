    "intro": "Rhynchospora rugosa subsp. lavarum, commonly known as the rough bog sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in bogs, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are rough to the touch, giving it its common name. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of small, spike-like flowers, which are usually pale green to brown in color. Rhynchospora rugosa subsp. lavarum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
