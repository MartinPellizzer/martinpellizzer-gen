    "intro": "Rosa canina var. aciculata, commonly known as the prickly rose or bristly dog rose, is a variant of the dog rose native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and small, fragrant pink or white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces oval, red-orange hips that are rich in vitamin C and are used in herbal remedies. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with serrated edges, and the plant is often found in hedgerows and woodland edges. It is a hardy shrub that thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade."
