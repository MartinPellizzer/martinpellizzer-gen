    "intro": "Rosa aucuparioides, commonly known as the alpine rose, is a species of flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its dense, thorny stems and small, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, pink to white flowers in late spring to early summer. Rosa aucuparioides thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its botanical features make it an important species for studying plant adaptation to high-altitude ecosystems."
