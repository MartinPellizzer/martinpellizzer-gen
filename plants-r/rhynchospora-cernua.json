    "intro": "Rhynchospora cernua, commonly known as the nodding sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in marshes, swamps, and other moist environments, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade. The plant features triangular, grass-like leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a spike-like inflorescence. Its roots are often rhizomatous, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. Rhynchospora cernua plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wetland organisms."
