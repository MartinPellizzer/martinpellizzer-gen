The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as marshes and ponds. Its leaves are broad and arrow-shaped, while its flowers are small and white, often arranged in clusters. The tubers are harvested for their crunchy texture and mild flavor, making them a popular vegetable in Asian cuisine."
