It is characterized by its small, oval leaves that are often glossy and dark green in color. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries in the autumn. These berries are a significant food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or scrublands."
