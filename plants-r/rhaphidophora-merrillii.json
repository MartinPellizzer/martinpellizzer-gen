It is a member of the Araceae family, characterized by its distinctive arrow-shaped leaves and inflorescence. The plant typically grows as an understory species in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense clusters. The leaves are often used in traditional medicine and as a food source in some regions."
