    "intro": "Rafflesia lagascae, commonly known as the \"Bornean corpse flower,\" is a parasitic plant found in the rainforests of Borneo. It is notable for producing the world's largest individual flower, which can reach up to 3 feet in diameter. The plant lacks leaves, stems, and roots, relying entirely on its host plant for nutrients. Its flowers emit a strong, unpleasant odor resembling rotting meat, which attracts flies and other insects for pollination. Due to habitat loss, Rafflesia lagascae is considered vulnerable, highlighting the need for conservation efforts in its native ecosystem."
