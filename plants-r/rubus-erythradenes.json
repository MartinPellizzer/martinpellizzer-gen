    "intro": "Rubus erythradenes, commonly known as the red-rooted blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and thorny stems, which are typical of many Rubus species. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black when mature. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the plant thrives in moist, shaded environments. Botanically, it is notable for its extensive root system, which contributes to its resilience in various soil types."
