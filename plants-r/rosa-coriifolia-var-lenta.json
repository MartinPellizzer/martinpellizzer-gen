    "intro": "Rosa coriifolia var. lenta, commonly known as the slow-growing shrub rose, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its upright, thornless stems and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a slightly serrated margin, while the plant produces small, red hips that persist into winter. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. This variety is noted for its slow growth and compact form, ideal for small spaces."
