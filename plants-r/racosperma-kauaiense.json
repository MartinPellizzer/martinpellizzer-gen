    "intro": "Racosperma kauaiense, commonly known as Kauai's ghost fern, is a rare endemic fern found exclusively on the island of Kauai in Hawaii. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically less than a foot in length. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories and rocky crevices. Its unique morphology and restricted habitat make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, it is considered critically endangered."
