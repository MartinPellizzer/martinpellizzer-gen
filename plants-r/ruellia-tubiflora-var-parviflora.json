    "intro": "Ruellia tubiflora var. parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered ruellia, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular, blue to violet flowers that bloom from summer to fall. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for gardeners in warm climates. Its ornamental value comes from its vibrant flowers and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
