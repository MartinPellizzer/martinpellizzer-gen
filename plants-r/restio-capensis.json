    "intro": "Restio capensis, commonly known as the Cape restio, is a perennial grass-like plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Restionaceae family and is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in coastal and sandy environments, thriving in well-drained soils. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. Restio capensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ability to withstand salty air."
