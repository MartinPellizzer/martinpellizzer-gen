    "intro": "Rubus rhombifolius microgene wimmerianus, commonly known as the Wimmerian raspberry, is a rare and less-studied species within the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive rhomboid-shaped leaves and small, aggregate fruits that resemble raspberries. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, with five petals and numerous stamens. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
