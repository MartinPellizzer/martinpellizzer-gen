    "intro": "Rubus fictus var. pilocarpus, commonly known as the pilocarpus raspberry, is a variant of the raspberry plant characterized by its unique foliage and fruiting habits. It typically grows in temperate regions, preferring well-drained soil and partial shade. The leaves are usually serrated with a slightly hairy texture, and the flowers are small, white, and clustered in the axils of the leaves. The fruit, which is a aggregate berry, is generally smaller than standard raspberries and has a tart flavor. This variant is less commonly cultivated but is of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its genetic distinctiveness."
