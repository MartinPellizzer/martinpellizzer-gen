    "intro": "Rubus acroglotta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved blackberry, is a species of bramble native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, thorny stems and small, dark purple to black berries. The plant produces trifoliate leaves with serrated edges and white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in woodland edges, hedgerows, and disturbed soils, often forming dense thickets. The berries are edible but are generally less flavorful compared to other Rubus species."
