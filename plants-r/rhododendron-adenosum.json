    "intro": "Rhododendron adenosum, commonly known as the alpine rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Asia, particularly in the Himalayas and eastern China. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, pink to white flowers in the spring, which are often fragrant. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, providing a striking contrast to the vibrant blossoms. Rhododendron adenosum is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
