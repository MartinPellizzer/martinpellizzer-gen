    "intro": "Ruschia abrupta, commonly known as the dwarf fireplant, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features compact, rosette-shaped leaves that are typically green with red or purple markings. The plant produces small, vibrant flowers in shades of yellow, orange, or red during the summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
