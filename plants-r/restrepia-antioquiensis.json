    "intro": "Restrepia antioquiensis, commonly known as the Antioquian orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Colombia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and intricate floral structure. The plant typically produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow, often with a distinctive lip. It thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered vulnerable and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists."
