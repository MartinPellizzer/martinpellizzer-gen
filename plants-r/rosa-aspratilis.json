It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of fragrant, pink to white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has dark green, serrated leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of silvery hair. Rosa aspratilis is adapted to cold climates and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Its flowers are not only ornamental but also attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
