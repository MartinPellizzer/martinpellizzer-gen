    "intro": "Rubus impar, commonly known as the rough bramble, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its thorny stems and trifoliate leaves, which are typically covered in fine, stiff hairs. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits called drupes, which are usually red or black when mature. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodlands, hedgerows, and disturbed soils. Due to its hardy nature, it plays an important role in supporting local wildlife and ecosystem biodiversity."
