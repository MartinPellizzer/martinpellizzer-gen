    "intro": "Rosa viscaria var. parceaculeata, commonly known as the everglast rose, is a compact, deciduous shrub native to eastern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, thornless growth habit and clusters of small, fragrant pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces bright red hips, which are ornamental and contain seeds. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established. Its hardy nature makes it suitable for rock gardens and as a border plant in temperate climates."
