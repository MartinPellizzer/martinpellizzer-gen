    "intro": "Rhamnus citrifolia var. nipponica, commonly known as Japanese buckthorn, is a shrub or small tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by orange-red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or shrubland habitats. This variety is closely related to the common buckthorn but exhibits distinct morphological and ecological characteristics."
