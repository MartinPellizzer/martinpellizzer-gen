    "intro": "Rubus calotemnus, commonly known as the broad-leafed blackberry, is a species of brambles native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its large, dark green leaves with a rough texture and its clusters of small, black, edible berries. The plant produces thorny stems and has a sprawling growth habit, often forming dense thickets. It thrives in woodland edges and disturbed soils, preferring partial to full sun. The berries are typically harvested in the fall and are valued for their tart flavor and use in culinary applications."
