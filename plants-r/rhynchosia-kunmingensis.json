    "intro": "Rhynchosia kunmingensis, commonly known as the Kunming legume, is a flowering plant native to China. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its distinctive pod fruits and nitrogen-fixing abilities. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, with a variety of colors ranging from white to purple. The seeds are enclosed in a hairy pod, which aids in their dispersal by wind or animals."
