    "intro": "Roupala brasiliensis var. subintegra, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a species native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree characterized by its dense, aromatic wood and elliptical leaves with a glossy surface. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles, followed by small, woody fruits containing single seeds. Its botanical features make it valuable for both ornamental purposes and traditional uses in local communities. However, due to overharvesting, it is now considered endangered and protected in several regions."
