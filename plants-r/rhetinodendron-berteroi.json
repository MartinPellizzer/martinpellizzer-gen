    "intro": "Rhetinodendron berteroi, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its dense, dark reddish-brown wood, which is highly valued for its tonal qualities in musical instruments. The plant has compound leaves with elongated leaflets and produces small, greenish-white flowers. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds. Due to overharvesting, it is now classified as endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
