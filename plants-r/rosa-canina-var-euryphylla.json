    "intro": "Rosa canina var. euryphylla, commonly known as the broadleaf dog rose, is a variant of the dog rose species native to Europe. It is characterized by its broader, more elongated leaves compared to the typical Rosa canina. The plant produces fragrant pink or white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by red, hairy fruits called hips. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often found in hedgerows and woodland edges. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in herbal medicine."
