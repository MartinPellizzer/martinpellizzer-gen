    "intro": "Rosularia hissarica, commonly known as the Hissar rosebay, is a perennial shrub native to Central Asia. It features dense, compact growth with fleshy, succulent leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of pink and white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and arid landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping."
