    "intro": "Rosa tomentella f. burnatii, commonly known as the Burnatii rose, is a botanical variant of the woolly rose, characterized by its dense, white tomentose (hairy) covering on its stems and leaves. This subspecies is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, where it thrives in cool, temperate climates with well-drained soils. The flowers are typically pink to red, with five petals and a strong, pleasant fragrance, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. It is a shrub that can grow up to 1.5 meters tall, with thorny stems and dark green, ovate leaves. Due to its hardy nature and aesthetic appeal, it is often cultivated in gardens and used in floral arrangements."
