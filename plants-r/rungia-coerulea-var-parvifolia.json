It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, bell-shaped blue or violet flowers. The leaves are typically narrow and lanceolate, giving the plant its \"parvifolia\" designation, which refers to its small leaves. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant."
