    "intro": "Rosa canina f. calycosa, commonly known as the bristly dog rose, is a botanical variant of the common dog rose. It is characterized by its bristly stems and hairy leaves, which distinguish it from the typical form. The flowers are usually pale pink to white, with five petals, and appear in clusters. It is a shrub that thrives in temperate climates, often found in woodland edges and hedgerows. The plant produces red, hairy fruits known as hips, which are rich in vitamin C."
