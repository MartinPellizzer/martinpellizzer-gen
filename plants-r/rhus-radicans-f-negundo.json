It is a deciduous shrub or small tree with opposite, ovate leaves that are often lobed and have a distinctive reddish hue. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in panicles, followed by winged samaras that aid in wind dispersal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is native to the eastern United States. Its ornamental value and adaptability make it a popular choice for landscaping in shaded or semi-shaded areas."
