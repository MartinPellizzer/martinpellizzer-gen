    "intro": "Rosa \u00d7 dumetorum f. annoniana, commonly known as the Alpina rose, is a hybrid shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink to white. The leaves are compound, consisting of five to seven oval-shaped leaflets with a slightly serrated edge. This plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for garden borders and hedging. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to produce attractive hips in the fall."
