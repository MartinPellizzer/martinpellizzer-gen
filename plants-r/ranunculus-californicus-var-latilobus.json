It is a herbaceous perennial with delicate, yellow flowers that have five to nine petals. The leaves are typically palmately divided, with broad, lobed segments that give the plant its common name. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along streambanks. This variety is closely related to other ranunculus species but is distinguished by its unique leaf morphology and floral characteristics."
