    "intro": "Rhamnus \u00d7 lemaniana, commonly known as the cross-leaved buckthorn, is a hybrid shrub native to Europe. It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its dark green, oval-shaped leaves that are often slightly hairy. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by black, egg-shaped berries that are a food source for birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or hedgerows. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
