    "intro": "Rubus tomentosus subsp. tomentosifrons, commonly known as the woolly blackberry, is a shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, white-tomentose (hairy) foliage and stems, which provide a distinctive appearance. The plant produces aggregate fruits, known as berries, that are typically dark purple to black when mature. These berries are edible, though often tart, and are used in local cuisines and traditional medicine. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
