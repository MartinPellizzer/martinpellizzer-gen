    "intro": "Regalia ayabacana, commonly known as the golden crown orchid, is a striking tropical plant native to the rainforests of Central America. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow petals and a distinctive crown-like structure at the base of its flowers. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its flowers bloom in late spring and are pollinated primarily by bees and butterflies. Regalia ayabacana is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
