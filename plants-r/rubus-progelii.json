    "intro": "Rubus progelii, commonly known as the alpine raspberry, is a species of brambles native to the high-altitude regions of western North America. It is characterized by its small, thorny stems and clusters of white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces small, edible berries that are typically red or yellow in color, though they are less commonly consumed by humans compared to other raspberry species. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Rubus progelii is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
