    "intro": "Ranunculus gracililobus, commonly known as the slender-lobed buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It features delicate, trifoliate leaves with finely divided lobes and bright yellow, cup-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, and the plant is known for its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes. Ranunculus gracililobus is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native plant gardens."
