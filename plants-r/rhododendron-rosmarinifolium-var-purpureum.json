    "intro": "Rhododendron rosmarinifolium var. purpureum, commonly known as the purple-leafed azalea, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It features dense, dark green foliage that turns a striking purple-red in the fall, adding vibrant color to the landscape. The plant produces showy clusters of pink to lavender flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its seasonal color changes and compact growth habit."
