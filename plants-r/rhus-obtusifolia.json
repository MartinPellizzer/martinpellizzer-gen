    "intro": "Rhus obtusifolia, commonly known as the southern waxleaf buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are usually smooth and have a waxy texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are followed by red, fleshy berries that attract birds. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions and full sun to partial shade. Rhus obtusifolia is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and adaptability."
