    "intro": "Rapuntium pteropodum, commonly known as the winged cress, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves and small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces capsules that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is considered a common weed in agricultural settings."
