    "intro": "Rhus aromatica var. illinoensis, commonly known as sweetgum, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and clusters of spiny, oval-shaped fruits that mature to a reddish-brown color. The plant produces small, white, five-petaled flowers in the spring, which are followed by the distinctive, star-shaped, spiky fruit capsules. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a serrated margin, turning bright yellow in the fall. Sweetgum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping due to its rapid growth and adaptability to various soil types."
