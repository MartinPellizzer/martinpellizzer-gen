It is characterized by its woody stems and elliptical leaves with a smooth, dark green surface. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring. Its fruit is a woody capsule that contains several seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
