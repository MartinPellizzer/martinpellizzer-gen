    "intro": "Ritchiea tessmannii, commonly known as the Tessmann's cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the tropical rainforests of northeastern Brazil. It belongs to the cycad family, Cycadaceae, and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feathery leaves. The plant is dioecious, meaning it has separate male and female plants, and relies on specific pollinators for reproduction. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Ritchiea tessmannii is considered critically endangered and is a subject of conservation efforts."
