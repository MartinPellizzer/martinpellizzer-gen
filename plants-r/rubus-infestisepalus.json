    "intro": "Rubus infestisepalus, commonly known as the hairy bramble, is a species of flowering plant in the rose family. It is characterized by its thorny stems and trifoliate leaves, which are typically covered in fine, hairy pubescence. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits known as drupes, which are usually red or black in color. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils. Due to its invasive growth habit, it can dominate local vegetation if left unchecked."
