    "intro": "Ranunculus aconitifolius, commonly known as the poison leaf buttercup, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves that resemble those of the aconite, hence its scientific name. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in early summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in meadows and forest clearings. Due to its toxic properties, it should be handled with care."
