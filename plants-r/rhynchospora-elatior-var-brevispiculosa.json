    "intro": "Rhynchospora elatior var. brevispiculosa, commonly known as the short-bracted spike-rush, is a flowering plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded habitats, such as marshes and wet meadows. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a smooth surface, and the inflorescences are usually shorter than those of the typical variety. This variant is notable for its compact growth form and is often found in the northern regions of North America."
