    "intro": "Robinia florida, commonly known as the redbud tree, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of pink to purple flowers that bloom in early spring. The tree produces long, flat pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Robinia florida typically grows to a height of 20 to 30 feet and has a rounded, spreading canopy. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, with a distinctive flaky texture."
