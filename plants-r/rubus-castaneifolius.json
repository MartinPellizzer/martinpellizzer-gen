    "intro": "Rubus castaneifolius, commonly known as the chestnut-leaf blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves that resemble chestnut leaves, with a serrated margin and a dark green upper surface. The plant produces small, dark red berries that are typically harvested in the fall. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight. Rubus castaneifolius is often found in woodland edges and thickets, contributing to the ecological diversity of its habitat."
