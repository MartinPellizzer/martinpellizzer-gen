    "intro": "Rugoloa pilosa, commonly known as the hairy rugoso, is a flowering plant native to the Andean region of South America. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. Rugoloa pilosa is often found in moist, shaded environments such as cloud forests. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for study in plant morphology and ecological adaptation."
