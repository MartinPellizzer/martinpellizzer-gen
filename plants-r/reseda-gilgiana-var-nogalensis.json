    "intro": "Reseda gilgiana var. nogalensis, commonly known as the Nogal Reseda, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, facilitating its dispersal in dry, open habitats. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soils in semi-arid areas."
