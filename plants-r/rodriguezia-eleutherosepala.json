    "intro": "Rodriguezia eleutherosepala, commonly known as the pink-flowered Rodriguezia, is a striking tropical plant native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its large, velvety pink bracts that resemble flowers, though they are actually modified leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, adding to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and limited natural range, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts."
