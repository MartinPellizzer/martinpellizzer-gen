    "intro": "Ranunculus aeolicus, commonly known as the Aeolic buttercup, is a rare flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its delicate, yellow flowers with five petals and a hairy stem. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in sunny, well-drained environments. Its leaves are palmately lobed, and it produces small, bead-like fruits that disperse its seeds. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered in many areas."
