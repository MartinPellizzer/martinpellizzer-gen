    "intro": "Rhynchotechum formosanum, commonly known as the Formosan liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is a small, leafy liverwort that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a thalloid structure, with a dense, mat-like growth form composed of flattened, lobed leaves. Its reproductive structures, including antheridia and archegonia, are located on the underside of the thallus, typical of liverworts. Rhynchotechum formosanum is often found in subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia, where it thrives in humid climates."
