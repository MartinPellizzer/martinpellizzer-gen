    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 monticola, commonly known as the blackberry raspberry, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Rubus ursinus (blackberry) and Rubus idaeus (raspberry). It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black in color, with a tart flavor and high acidity. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils. Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits a range of morphological and genetic variability."
