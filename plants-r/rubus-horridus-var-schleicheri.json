    "intro": "Rubus horridus var. schleicheri, commonly known as the Schleicher's bramble, is a variant of the bramble genus characterized by its prickly stems and dense growth habit. It is native to regions of Europe and parts of Asia, typically found in woodland edges and disturbed soils. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are often red or black in color, attracting various pollinators and birds. Its leaves are usually trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the plant is known for its robust and aggressive growth. Due to its thorny nature, it is often considered a weed in agricultural areas."
