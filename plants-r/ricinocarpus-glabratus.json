    "intro": "Ricinocarpus glabratus, commonly known as the smooth ricin tree, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and palm-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing toxic seeds. Due to the presence of ricin, a potent toxin, it is important to handle the plant with care. It is often found in coastal areas and can thrive in sandy soils."
