    "intro": "Rhamnus pilosa, commonly known as the hairy buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and small, oval leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by black, spherical berries in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or rocky areas. Rhamnus pilosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used historically in traditional medicine."
