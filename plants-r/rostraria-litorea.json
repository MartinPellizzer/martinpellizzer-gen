    "intro": "Rostraria litorea, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, spiny, leaf-like bracts that surround its small, yellow flowers. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in maritime environments. Its unique morphology helps it resist wind and salt spray, making it well adapted to coastal habitats. Rostraria litorea is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
