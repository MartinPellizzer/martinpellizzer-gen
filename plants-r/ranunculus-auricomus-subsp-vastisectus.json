    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus subsp. vastisectus, commonly known as the large-leaf buttercup, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, palmately divided leaves and bright yellow flowers with five petals. The subspecies is distinguished by its larger, more deeply lobed leaves compared to the typical form of R. auricomus. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges. The plant is an important component of wetland ecosystems and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
