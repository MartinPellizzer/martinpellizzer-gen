    "intro": "Rubus hypoleucos, commonly known as the white-berried blackberry, is a species of brambles native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by edible, white to pale yellow berries in the summer. These berries are smaller than typical blackberries and have a delicate, slightly sweet flavor. The plant is often found in moist woodlands and along stream banks, thriving in partial shade."
