    "intro": "Rosmarinus palaui, commonly known as Palaui rosemary, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Rosmarinus genus. It is native to the island of Palau in the western Pacific Ocean, where it thrives in coastal and rocky habitats. The plant features aromatic, needle-like leaves that are often used in traditional medicine by local communities. Its small, pale blue to purple flowers bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Rosmarinus palaui is considered a vulnerable species."
