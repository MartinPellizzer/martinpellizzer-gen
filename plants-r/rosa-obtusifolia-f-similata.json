    "intro": "Rosa obtusifolia f. similata, commonly known as the similar-leaved shrub rose, is a compact, deciduous shrub native to southern Europe. It features dense, thornless stems and small, ovate leaves with a slightly wavy margin. The plant produces fragrant, semi-double pink flowers in late spring to early summer. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained soils. This variety is often used in rock gardens or as a border plant due to its hardiness and low maintenance requirements."
