    "intro": "Rubus curtistamineus, commonly known as the narrow-stamen blackberry, is a species of bramble native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple or black when mature. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and lesser-known member of the Rubus genus."
