    "intro": "Rubus odoratus f. albus, commonly known as the white-flowered evergreen raspberry, is a rare and distinctive variant of the common raspberry. It is characterized by its pale white flowers, which contrast with the typical red blooms of the species. This plant is native to the mountainous regions of western China and is often found in shaded, moist environments. Its foliage consists of trifoliate leaves with serrated edges, and it produces small, edible berries that are less prominent than those of the standard Rubus odoratus. Due to its limited distribution and unique appearance, it is considered a botanical curiosity and is often cultivated in specialized gardens."
