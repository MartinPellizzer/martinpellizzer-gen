    "intro": "Rouya, commonly known as the African violet, is a tropical plant native to Central and Eastern Africa. It belongs to the genus Saintpaulia and is characterized by its vibrant, velvety flowers that come in a wide range of colors. The plant typically has thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its native environment. Rouya thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is a popular houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
