    "intro": "Rumex cardiocarpus, commonly known as heart-leaved sorrel, is a perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive heart-shaped leaves, which are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist, shaded environments. The leaves are edible but can be quite tart due to their high oxalic acid content."
