    "intro": "Rubus serpens subsp. hylonomus, commonly known as the Hylonomus blackberry, is a shrub native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and thorny stems, which help it to climb and spread across rocky and arid landscapes. The plant produces small, aggregated fruits known as drupes, which are typically dark purple to black in color. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three leaflets that are serrated and have a leathery texture. This subspecies is adapted to dry conditions and is often found in chaparral and scrub habitats."
