    "intro": "Rhamnus leprosa, commonly known as the Leprous buckthorn, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its small, oval leaves that are often covered in a whitish, powdery coating, giving it a leprous appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring, followed by dark, shiny berries that are an important food source for birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Rhamnus leprosa is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used in traditional medicine for its astringent properties."
