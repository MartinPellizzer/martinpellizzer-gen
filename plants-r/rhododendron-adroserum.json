    "intro": "Rhododendron adroserum, commonly known as the bog rhododendron, is a flowering plant native to the wetlands and bogs of eastern North America. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in acidic, nutrient-poor soils and requires consistent moisture, making it a specialist of bog ecosystems. Its leaves are typically dark green and leathery, adapted to retain water in its moist habitat. Rhododendron adroserum plays a role in stabilizing bog soils and supporting local biodiversity."
