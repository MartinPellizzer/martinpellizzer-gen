    "intro": "Rutaea lobata, commonly known as the Mexican mountain ash, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Mexico and Central America. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically lobed or serrated. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in clusters, which are followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for some bird species. Rutaea lobata thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens in suitable climates."
