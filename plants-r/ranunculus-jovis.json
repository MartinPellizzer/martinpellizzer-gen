It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family, characterized by its showy, often colorful flowers. The plant typically features simple, palmately lobed leaves and produces small, yellow or white flowers with numerous stamens. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
