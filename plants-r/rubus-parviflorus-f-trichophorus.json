    "intro": "Rubus parviflorus f. trichophorus, commonly known as the hairy-stemmed raspberry, is a variant of the common raspberry found in North America. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which give it a distinct appearance compared to the typical raspberry. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red when mature. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas or along streambanks. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated for its edible fruits."
