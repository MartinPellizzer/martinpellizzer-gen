It thrives in saline and alkaline soils, often found in tidal zones and along shorelines. The plant features alternate, wavy-edged leaves that are typically reddish or purplish in color. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and arranged in loose clusters, producing edible, sour-tasting leaves. Sea sorrel is adapted to withstand harsh coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds."
