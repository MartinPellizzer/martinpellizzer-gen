    "intro": "Rumex \u00d7 simonkaianus, commonly known as the hybrid sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant that exhibits characteristics of both its parent species, Rumex acetosa and Rumex acetogonium. It typically grows in moist, temperate environments such as wetlands and marshes, where it thrives in shaded or semi-shaded conditions. The plant has broad, arrow-shaped leaves with a serrated margin, and it produces small, clustered flowers in the spring. Its botanical features include a rhizomatous root system that aids in its spread and survival in wetland habitats. The species is noted for its medicinal and culinary uses, similar to its parent species."
