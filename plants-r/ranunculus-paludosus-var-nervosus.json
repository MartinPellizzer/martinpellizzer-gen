    "intro": "Ranunculus paludosus var. nervosus, commonly known as the water buttercup variant with nervy veins, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland habitats in Europe. It features delicate, palmate leaves with prominent, often contrasting veins, and produces showy yellow flowers with five to eight petals. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in marshes, fens, and along the edges of ponds. It is characterized by its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed wetland areas. Due to its preference for specific environmental conditions, it is considered an indicator species for wetland health."
