    "intro": "Rhipsalis leiophloea, commonly known as the smooth-stemmed mistletoe cactus, is a unique epiphytic cactus native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its long, slender, and often pendulous stems that are covered in short, white hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that bloom throughout the year, followed by small, red berries. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it does not have true leaves in the traditional sense. Rhipsalis leiophloea is well adapted to humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees in the understory of tropical forests."
