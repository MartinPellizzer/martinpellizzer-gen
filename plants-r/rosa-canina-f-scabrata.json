    "intro": "Rosa canina f. scabrata, commonly known as the bristly dog rose, is a botanical variant of the common dog rose. It is characterized by its rough, bristly stems and leaves, which distinguish it from the typical form. The flowers are usually pale pink to white, with five petals, and appear in clusters. This subspecies is native to Europe and western Asia, often found in woodlands and scrubland. It produces red, hairy hips that are used in traditional medicine and culinary applications."
