    "intro": "Rhytiglossa nana, commonly known as the dwarf pincushion orchid, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to the wetlands of South America. It typically grows to a height of less than 10 centimeters, with a compact, cushion-like growth habit. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, pink or white flowers arranged in a spike. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the nutrient-poor wetland soils. The species is known for its delicate appearance and is often found in marshy or swampy habitats."
