    "intro": "Razoumofskya occidentalis, commonly known as the western razoumofskya, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are dark green and leathery, adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor, acidic soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive indicator species for high-altitude ecosystems."
