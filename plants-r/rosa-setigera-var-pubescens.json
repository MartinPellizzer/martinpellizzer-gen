    "intro": "Rosa setigera var. pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent willowleaf rose, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It features slender, arching stems covered in fine, soft hairs, which give it its varietal name \"pubescens.\" The leaves are elongated, willow-like, and have a distinctive serrated margin, often with a pale underside. Its flowers are pale pink to white, appearing in clusters along the stems during late spring to early summer. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in naturalized landscapes due to its adaptability and low maintenance requirements."
