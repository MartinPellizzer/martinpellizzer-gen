    "intro": "Rosa glauca var. acutiformis, commonly known as the blue rose or blue shrub rose, is a cultivar of the Rosa glauca species. It is characterized by its striking blue-pink flower color, which is a result of high concentrations of anthocyanins. The plant typically grows as a compact shrub with thorny stems and dark green, oval-shaped leaves. Its flowers bloom in clusters and are often used in ornamental gardening for their unique hue. This variety is well-suited for coastal gardens due to its tolerance of salty air and well-drained soils."
