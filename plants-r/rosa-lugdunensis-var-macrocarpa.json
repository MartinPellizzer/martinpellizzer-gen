    "intro": "Rosa lugdunensis var. macrocarpa, commonly known as the large-fruited Gallic rose, is a cultivar of the Gallic rose species native to Europe. It is characterized by its vigorous growth, thorny stems, and dark green, serrated leaves. The plant produces large, fragrant flowers in shades of pink to red, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its fruit, known as a rose hip, is notably larger and more robust than that of the typical Rosa lugdunensis. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal medicine."
