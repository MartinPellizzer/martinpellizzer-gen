It is a perennial shrub that thrives in coastal and saline environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by elongated, pod-like fruits. Its seeds are encased in a hard, leathery shell, and the plant is adapted to tolerate high salinity and wind exposure. Ricinocarpus leptorhachis plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
