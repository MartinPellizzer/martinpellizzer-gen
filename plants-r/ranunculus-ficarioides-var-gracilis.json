    "intro": "Ranunculus ficarioides var. gracilis, commonly known as the slenderleaf buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of Asia. It features delicate, palmately divided leaves and bright yellow, spurred flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It has a short, stout rhizome and produces small, hairy fruits that disperse via wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
