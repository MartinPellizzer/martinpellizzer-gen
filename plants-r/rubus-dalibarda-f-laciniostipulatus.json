    "intro": "Rubus dalibarda f. laciniostipulatus, commonly known as the laciniated leaf raspberry, is a rare and delicate shrub native to the mountainous regions of the western United States. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves that give it a unique appearance. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or yellow in color, which are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded, rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a sensitive species in conservation efforts."
