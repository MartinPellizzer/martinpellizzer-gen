    "intro": "Rubus oreogeton var. strelinensis, commonly known as the Sardinian blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry species native to the island of Sardinia. It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically harvested in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the Mediterranean climate. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native range."
