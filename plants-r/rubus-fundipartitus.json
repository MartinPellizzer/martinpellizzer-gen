    "intro": "Rubus fundipartitus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved blackberry. It is a species of bramble native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. The plant features compound leaves with three to five leaflets, often with serrated edges. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, and it produces edible berries that are similar to other Rubus species. However, due to its limited distribution and rarity, it is considered a lesser-known member of the Rubus genus."
