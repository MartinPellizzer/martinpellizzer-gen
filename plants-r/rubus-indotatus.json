It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, dark purple to black berries. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and shrublands. Its leaves are compound, with three to five leaflets, and the flowers are usually white or pale pink. The berries are edible when ripe but can be quite tart and are often used in local cuisines or traditional medicine."
