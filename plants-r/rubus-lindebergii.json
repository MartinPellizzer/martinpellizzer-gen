It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and produces small, dark red to black berries. The plant has compound leaves with serrated edges and produces white or pale pink flowers in the spring. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and partial shade. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
