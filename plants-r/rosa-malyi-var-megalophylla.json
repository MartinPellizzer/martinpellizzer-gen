    "intro": "Rosa malyi var. megalophylla, commonly known as the large-leafed evergreen rose, is a shrub native to the Himalayas. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and leathery, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green with a glossy surface. The plant produces fragrant, single or semi-double flowers in shades of pink and white, typically blooming in spring. It is well adapted to cool, moist climates and thrives in partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is a popular choice for gardeners in temperate regions."
