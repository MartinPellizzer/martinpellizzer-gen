    "intro": "Rhododendron callichilioides, commonly known as the purple-leaved rhododendron, is a species native to the eastern Himalayas. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage that displays a striking purple hue, particularly in shaded conditions. The plant produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments with acidic soil, often found in mountainous regions. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
