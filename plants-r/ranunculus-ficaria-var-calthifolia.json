    "intro": "Ranunculus ficaria var. calthifolia, commonly known as the lesser celandine, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features bright yellow flowers with a distinctive greenish center, typically blooming in early spring. The plant has palmately divided leaves that are glossy and often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks. Its botanical name reflects its close relation to the genus Caltha, which includes other buttercup-like plants."
