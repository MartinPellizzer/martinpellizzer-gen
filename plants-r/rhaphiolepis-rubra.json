    "intro": "Rhaphiolepis rubra, commonly known as the redleaf cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub native to China. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its showy, bright red berries that persist through winter. The plant features small, ovate leaves that are dark green and glossy on top, with a lighter underside. It produces clusters of white flowers in early spring, which are followed by the striking red fruits. Rhaphiolepis rubra is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its winter interest and hardy nature."
