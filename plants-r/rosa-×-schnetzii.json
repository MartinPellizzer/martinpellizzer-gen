    "intro": "Rosa \u00d7 schnetzii, commonly known as the Schnetz snowbush, is a hybrid rose species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The plant produces fragrant, semi-double to double white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the stems are covered in fine, glandular hairs. Rosa \u00d7 schnetzii is well-suited to rocky or well-drained soils and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
