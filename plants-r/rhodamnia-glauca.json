    "intro": "Rhodamnia glauca, commonly known as the silverleaf hakea, is a species of flowering plant native to southeastern Australia. It is a shrub that typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. The plant features narrow, silver-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its small, white or pinkish flowers appear in clusters and are followed by woody, cone-like fruits. Rhodamnia glauca is often used in native gardens due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
