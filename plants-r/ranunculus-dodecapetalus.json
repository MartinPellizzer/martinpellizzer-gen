    "intro": "Ranunculus dodecapetalus, commonly known as the twelve-petaled buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It features a basal rosette of sharply toothed, lance-shaped leaves and produces showy, yellow flowers with twelve petals arranged in a star-like pattern. The plant typically blooms from late spring to early summer, and its flowers are often visited by bees and other pollinators. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, and it is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. The species is noted for its ornamental value and is cultivated in gardens for its delicate, bright yellow blooms."
