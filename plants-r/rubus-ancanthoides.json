    "intro": "Rubus ancanthoides, commonly known as the prickly blackberry, is a species of bramble native to eastern North America. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows in moist woodlands and along stream banks. The plant produces small, dark red berries that are edible but often covered in fine hairs. Its stems are covered in thorns, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The botanical features of Rubus ancanthoides make it a distinctive and ecologically important member of the Rubiaceae family."
