    "intro": "Ribes alpinum var. sterile, commonly known as the sterile gooseberry, is a variant of the alpine gooseberry native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, edible berries that are typically seedless due to its sterile nature. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and cooler climates, often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its foliage consists of dark green, oval-shaped leaves with serrated edges, and it produces clusters of yellow flowers in early summer. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and aesthetic qualities."
