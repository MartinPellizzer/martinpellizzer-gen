It features showy, yellow flowers with a distinctive, thickened petal base that gives it its common name. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30\u201360 centimeters, with hairy stems and trifoliate leaves. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and it prefers well-drained, rocky soils. Ranunculus pinguescens is often found in alpine meadows and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments."
