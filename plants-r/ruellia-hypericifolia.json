    "intro": "Ruellia hypericifolia, commonly known as the Mexican bluebell, is a flowering plant native to Central America and parts of the southern United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for gardeners in tropical and subtropical regions. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its vibrant flowers and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
