    "intro": "Rumex winterlii, commonly known as the Alpine sorrel, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped, reddish-pink leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are typically borne on erect, branched stems. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky soils. The species is notable for its edible leaves, which have a tangy, sour flavor due to their high content of oxalic acid."
