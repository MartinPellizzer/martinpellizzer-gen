    "intro": "Ranunculus delitescens, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a delicate aquatic plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features small, pale yellow flowers with five petals that often appear to be translucent or ghostly in appearance. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and marshes. Its leaves are typically floating or submersed, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. The species is noted for its ephemeral blooms, which often last only a short time before fading."
