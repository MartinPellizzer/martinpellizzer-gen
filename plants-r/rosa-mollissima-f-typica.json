It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and fragrant, semi-double pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, red-orange hips that are edible and often used in culinary applications. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardeners seeking a hardy, ornamental shrub. Its historical use in traditional medicine and horticulture adds to its botanical significance."
