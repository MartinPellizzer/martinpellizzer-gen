    "intro": "Ricinus communis f. cervatus, commonly known as the \"Cervus\" or \"Cervine\" castor plant, is a cultivated form of the castor oil plant. It is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves that resemble the shape of a deer's antlers, giving it its common name. The plant produces unique, spiny capsules that contain toxic seeds, which are used in the production of castor oil. It is typically grown as an ornamental plant due to its striking foliage. This variant is less commonly used for commercial castor oil production compared to the standard Ricinus communis."
