    "intro": "Ranunculus petiolaris var. arsenei, commonly known as the Arsenie's buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features delicate, bright yellow flowers with a distinctive, deeply lobed corolla, typically blooming in early summer. The plant has finely divided, trifoliate leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Its botanical interest lies in its unique morphology and limited distribution, making it a subject of study in botanic gardens and conservation efforts."
