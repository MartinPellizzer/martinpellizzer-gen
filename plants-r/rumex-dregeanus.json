    "intro": "Rumex dregeanus, commonly known as the African sorrel, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features erect, branched stems that are often hairy, and its leaves are alternate, lanceolate, and have a distinctive reddish or purple coloration. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, which are borne on short pedicels. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist, shaded environments. The leaves are edible and have a tart, sour flavor, making it a valued plant in local cuisines."
