    "intro": "Rhamnus canadensis, commonly known as Canadian buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 feet and has alternate, simple, ovate leaves with serrated margins. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by dark blue, oval berries in the fall. Its roots are fibrous and can spread aggressively, making it a potential invasive species in certain regions. The plant is often found in moist to wet soils along stream banks and in woodland edges."
