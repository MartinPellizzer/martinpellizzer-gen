    "intro": "Rosa sarmentosa, commonly known as the creeping rose, is a deciduous shrub native to temperate regions of Asia and Europe. It features thin, arching stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats or low-growing bushes. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and red, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are compound, consisting of five to seven oval leaflets with serrated edges. Rosa sarmentosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping for its ability to cover ground and prevent erosion."
