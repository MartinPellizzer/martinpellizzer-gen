    "intro": "Rourea barbata, commonly known as the barbed rourea, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, barbed leaves that give it its common name. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a rough texture due to the presence of small, stiff hairs. Rourea barbata produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, and it is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value."
