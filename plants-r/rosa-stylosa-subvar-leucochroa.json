    "intro": "Rosa stylosa subvar. leucochroa, commonly known as the white-stemmed wild rose, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It typically grows in moist woodlands and thickets, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. The plant features compound leaves with five to seven elliptical leaflets, and its flowers are pink to red, appearing in clusters. The subspecies is distinguished by its white, often glaucous stems and its smaller, more delicate flowers compared to other Rosa species. It produces rose hips that are orange-red and contain numerous seeds, contributing to its ecological importance in native habitats."
