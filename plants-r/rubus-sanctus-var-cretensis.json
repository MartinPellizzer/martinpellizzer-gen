It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, red berries. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in sunny, well-drained environments. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and its flowers are white with five petals. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
