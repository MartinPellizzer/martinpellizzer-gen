    "intro": "Rhipsalis prismatica, commonly known as the prism cactus, is a species of epiphytic cactus native to Brazil. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems covered in small, translucent tubercles. The plant produces clusters of white, fragrant flowers that bloom during the winter months. Its leaves are reduced to small, rounded spines, and it lacks the typical areoles found in other cacti. Rhipsalis prismatica is well adapted to humid, shaded environments and is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant."
