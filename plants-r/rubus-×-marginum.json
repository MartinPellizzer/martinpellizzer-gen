    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 marginum, commonly known as the hybrid blackberry raspberry, is a deciduous shrub that belongs to the Rosaceae family. It is a naturally occurring hybrid between Rubus ursinus (blackberry) and Rubus idaeus (raspberry), resulting in a plant that exhibits characteristics of both parent species. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark red to black in color, with a tart flavor. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it has thorny stems typical of the Rubus genus. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its edible fruits and ornamental value."
