    "intro": "Rhodiola rosea var. scopolii, commonly known as the alpine rose or golden root, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and the Caucasus. It thrives in cold, arid environments and is characterized by its fleshy, reddish roots and dense clusters of yellow or orange flowers. The plant is adapted to high altitudes and has a short growing season, which contributes to its rarity and medicinal value. Its rhizomes contain various bioactive compounds, including rosavins and salidrosides, which are believed to have adaptogenic properties. This variant is often cultivated for its purported health benefits and is used in traditional medicine systems."
