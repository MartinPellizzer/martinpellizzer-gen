    "intro": "Ricinus microcarpus proles aegypticus, commonly known as the Egyptian castor, is a variant of the castor oil plant native to the Nile Valley. It is a herbaceous annual that produces distinctive, spiny capsules containing toxic seeds. The plant has palmate leaves with three to five lobes, and it thrives in warm, arid climates. It is cultivated for its oil-rich seeds, which have historical and industrial uses. However, due to its toxic properties, it requires careful handling and is not commonly grown for ornamental purposes."
