    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus subsp. lacer, commonly known as the torn leaf buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, deeply lobed leaves that give it its subspecific name \"lacer,\" meaning torn. The plant produces showy yellow flowers with five petals, often accompanied by 5\u201315 sepals that resemble additional petals. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its botanical features make it a notable species in both ecological studies and horticultural gardens."
