    "intro": "Rhus copallinum var. lanceolata, commonly known as the lanceleaf sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are divided into narrow, lance-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clustered inflorescences, followed by red, fuzzy berries that are a food source for birds and wildlife. Its bark is smooth and grayish, becoming fissured with age, and it thrives in full sun to partial shade. The lanceleaf sumac is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to tolerate various soil conditions."
