It features a mat-forming growth habit with slender, spreading stems that root at the nodes. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in early spring. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it thrives in moist, shady environments. This variety is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks."
