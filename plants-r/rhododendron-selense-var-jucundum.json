It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in mountainous regions at elevations between 2,000 and 4,000 meters. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, providing a striking contrast to the vibrant pink or red flowers. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with acidic, well-drained soil."
