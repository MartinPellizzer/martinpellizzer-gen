    "intro": "Rosa caryophyllacea var. suecica, commonly known as the Swedish rose, is a shrub native to northern Europe. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are oval to elliptic in shape and have a hairy underside. The plant produces clusters of small, white, five-petaled flowers that bloom in late summer. Its fruit is a red, hairy hip that contains achenes, which are dispersed by wind. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its fragrance and hardiness."
