    "intro": "Rhodalsine procumbens var. linearifolia, commonly known as the linear-leaved rhodalsine, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the western United States. It features narrow, linear leaves that are typically arranged in a dense, mat-like formation. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers during the spring and summer months. Its foliage is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight."
