It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 6 to 12 inches long and have a distinctive oval shape. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers in cylindrical clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age. Robinia cylindrica is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in woodland edges and open areas."
