    "intro": "Rauia prancei, commonly known as the Prance's rauia, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Ecuador. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in high-altitude cloud forests, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Rauia prancei is considered a vulnerable species."
