It is a deciduous shrub that produces fragrant, pink to red flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant has dark green, serrated leaves and thorny stems, typical of many rose species. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens. Its historical use in perfumery and as a cut flower adds to its botanical and cultural significance."
