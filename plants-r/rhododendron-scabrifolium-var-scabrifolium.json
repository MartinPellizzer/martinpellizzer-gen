    "intro": "Rhododendron scabrifolium var. scabrifolium, commonly known as the roughleaf azalea, is a flowering shrub native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage with rough, leathery leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces clusters of showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and long-lasting blooms."
