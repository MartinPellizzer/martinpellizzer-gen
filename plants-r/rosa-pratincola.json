    "intro": "Rosa pratincola, commonly known as the alpine rose, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and vibrant, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically features narrow, dark green leaves and produces small, rose-like flowers in shades of pink and white. Rosa pratincola thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates, making it a hardy species for alpine gardens. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for rock gardens and as a ornamental plant in high-altitude landscapes."
