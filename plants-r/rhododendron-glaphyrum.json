    "intro": "Rhododendron glaphyrum, commonly known as the alpine rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Asia, particularly in China and the Himalayas. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. The plant features dense, dark green foliage and produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink and white during the spring. Its leaves are leathery and have a distinctive waxy coating, which helps protect it from harsh mountain conditions. Rhododendron glaphyrum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
