    "intro": "Rhododendron argyrophyllum subsp. hypoglaucum, commonly known as the silver-leaved rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage that exhibits a silvery-gray underside, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring. Its leaves are leathery and have a waxy texture, which helps it retain moisture in its native habitat. This subspecies is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes."
