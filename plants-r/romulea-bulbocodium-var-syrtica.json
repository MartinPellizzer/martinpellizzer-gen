It features a compact, rosette-like growth habit with thick, fleshy leaves adapted to store water. The plant produces bright yellow flowers with a distinctive cup-shaped structure, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it well-suited to dry environments. Due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and xeriscapes."
