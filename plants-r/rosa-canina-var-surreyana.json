    "intro": "Rosa canina var. surreyana, commonly known as the Surrey rose, is a variant of the dog rose native to southern England. It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with five to seven leaflets. The plant produces fragrant, pinkish-white flowers in late spring, which are followed by bright red, berry-like hips in autumn. These hips are edible and contain seeds that can be used for propagation. The Surrey rose is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical significance in horticulture."
