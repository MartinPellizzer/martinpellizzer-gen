    "intro": "Rosa coriifolia var. subtilis, commonly known as the Japanese rose or sweetbriar rose, is a deciduous shrub native to East Asia. It is characterized by its slender, arching stems and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that bloom in spring. The leaves are pinnately compound, with ovate to lanceolate leaflets that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible but not particularly palatable. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively hardy in temperate climates."
