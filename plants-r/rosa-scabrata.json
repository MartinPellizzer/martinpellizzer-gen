    "intro": "Rosa scabrata, commonly known as the roughleaf rose, is a species of shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its thorny stems and serrated, rough-textured leaves. The plant produces fragrant pink to red flowers in the spring, which are typically borne on long, slender pedicels. Rosa scabrata is often found in woodland edges, thickets, and moist soils, thriving in partial to full sun. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for garden cultivation, though it requires well-drained soil and moderate care."
