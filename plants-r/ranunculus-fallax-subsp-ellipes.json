It typically grows in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features delicate, palmate leaves and yellow flowers with five petals. It has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Due to its aggressive growth, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural settings."
