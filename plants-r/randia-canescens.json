    "intro": "Randia canescens, commonly known as rough randia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a rough texture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, typically blooming during the warmer months. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly serrated margin. Randia canescens is often found in moist, shaded areas such as forests and along stream banks."
