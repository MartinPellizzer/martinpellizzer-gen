    "intro": "Rhynchoglossum obliquum var. parviflorum, commonly known as the small-flowered rhynchoglossum, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and unique floral structures. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as cloud forests, where it thrives on rocky substrates. Its flowers are small and clustered, often displaying a striking combination of colors that attract specific pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
