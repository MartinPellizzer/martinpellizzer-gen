    "intro": "Rhipsalis houlletii, commonly known as the silver star cactus, is a species of epiphytic cactus native to Brazil. It is characterized by its long, flexible stems that often hang in cascading clusters, giving it a unique, trailing appearance. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom during the winter months, adding a delicate ornamental value. Its leaves are reduced to small, hair-like structures, and it thrives in bright, indirect light with well-draining soil. Rhipsalis houlletii is relatively low maintenance and suitable for indoor cultivation."
