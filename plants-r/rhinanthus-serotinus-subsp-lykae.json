    "intro": "Rhinanthus serotinus subsp. lykae, commonly known as the late yellow rattle, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. This subspecies is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially depends on other plants for water and nutrients. It typically grows in grasslands and open habitats, often in association with grasses and legumes. Its flowers are pollinated by bees and other insects, contributing to its ecological role in supporting pollinator populations."
