    "intro": "Rubus pyramidalis var. foliosus, commonly known as the pyramid raspberry, is a variant of the raspberry plant native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and thorny stems, which support its climbing or trailing form. The leaves are typically lobed and have a serrated edge, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, and it produces small, edible berries that are similar to other raspberry species. This plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil, making it a suitable choice for garden cultivation."
