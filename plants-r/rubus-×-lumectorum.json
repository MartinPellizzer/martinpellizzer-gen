    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 lumectorum, commonly known as the blackberry-loganberry hybrid, is a deciduous shrub belonging to the Rosaceae family. It is a naturally occurring hybrid between Rubus ursinus (blackberry) and Rubus loganobaccus (loganberry), resulting in a plant that exhibits traits of both parents. The plant produces large, dark purple to black fruits that are typically larger and sweeter than those of its parent species. Its foliage consists of trifoliate leaves with serrated edges, and it thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil. The hybrid is valued for its fruit quality and is often cultivated for commercial and home gardening purposes."
