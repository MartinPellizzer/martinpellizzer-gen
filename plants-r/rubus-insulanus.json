    "intro": "Rubus insulanus, commonly known as the island raspberry, is a species of bramble native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in moist, wooded areas and along stream banks. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are usually red or yellow in color, which are edible and often used in local cuisines. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and its stems are covered in fine, glandular hairs. Rubus insulanus plays an important role in supporting local wildlife, including birds and small mammals."
