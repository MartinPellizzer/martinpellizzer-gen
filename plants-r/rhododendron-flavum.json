It is characterized by its vibrant yellow flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows as an evergreen shrub, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, providing a striking contrast to its bright floral display. Rhododendron flavum thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade in its natural habitat."
