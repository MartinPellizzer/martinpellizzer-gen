    "intro": "Rubus serpens var. clinobotrys, commonly known as the creeping blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to various regions of the Americas. It is a shrub that typically grows along the ground, featuring woody stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The plant produces small, dark red to black berries that are often edible, though they may have a tart flavor. Its leaves are compound, with three to five leaflets that are usually serrated and have a slightly hairy texture. This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated for its berries in home gardens."
