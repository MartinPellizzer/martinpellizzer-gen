    "intro": "Rumex recurvatus, commonly known as the zigzag sorrel, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features alternate, broadly ovate to lanceolate leaves with a distinctive zigzag venation pattern. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are edible but have a sharp, tangy flavor due to their high oxalic acid content. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas and along stream banks."
