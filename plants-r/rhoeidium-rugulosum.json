    "intro": "Rhoeidium rugulosum, commonly known as the rough-leaved rhoeidium, is a species of flowering plant in the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its hairy, rough-textured leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is native to southern Africa, where it typically grows in grassy areas and along roadsides. It is often found in sandy or well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Rhoeidium rugulosum is not widely cultivated but is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
