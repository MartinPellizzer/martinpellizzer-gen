    "intro": "Rubus hystrix var. hirtifolius, commonly known as the hairy-leaf bramble, is a variant of the bramble plant native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and hairy leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are typically trifoliate, with three leaflets that are serrated along the edges. This plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers in the spring, followed by red, edible berries in the summer. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils."
