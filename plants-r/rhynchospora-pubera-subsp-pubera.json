    "intro": "Rhynchospora pubera subsp. pubera, commonly known as the hairy marsh sedge, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, three-lobed flowers. Its subspecies is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which distinguish it from other related species. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
