    "intro": "Restrepia angustilabia subsp. subserrata, commonly known as the narrow-lipped lady's slipper orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact, clumping growth habit and possesses a network of rhizomes that help anchor it in rocky or humus-rich soils. The plant produces striking, fragrant orchid flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch, which is a key feature of the orchid family. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, adapted to the cool, moist conditions of its habitat. This subspecies is notable for its ornamental value and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts for its unique appearance."
