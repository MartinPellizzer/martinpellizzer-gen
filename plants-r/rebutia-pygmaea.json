    "intro": "Rebutia pygmaea, commonly known as the miniature moon cactus, is a compact, low-growing succulent native to South America. It features a swollen, colorful tuberous rootstock that often displays vibrant hues of red, orange, or yellow. The plant produces delicate, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the spring and summer months. Its foliage consists of small, fleshy, paddle-shaped leaves that are typically green with a slight bluish tint. Rebutia pygmaea is well-suited for rock gardens or as a container plant due to its compact size and drought-tolerant nature."
