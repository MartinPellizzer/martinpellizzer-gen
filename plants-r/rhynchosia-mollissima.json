    "intro": "Rhynchosia mollissima, commonly known as velvetleaf, is a tropical annual legume native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are soft and velvety to the touch, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are followed by pods containing several round, edible seeds. It is often found in disturbed soils and can be invasive in some regions. Botanically, it is notable for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with Rhizobium bacteria."
