It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family, which includes parasitic and hemiparasitic plants. This species is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. The plant has a shallow root system and relies on host plants for some of its nutritional needs. Its conservation status is currently listed as vulnerable due to habitat loss and limited distribution."
