    "intro": "Rhus impermeabilis, commonly known as the winged sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often adorned with wing-like structures on the petioles, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by red, fuzzy fruits that attract birds and other wildlife. Its bark is rough and fissured, and it has a tendency to grow in dense thickets. Rhus impermeabilis is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in open woodlands and along stream banks."
