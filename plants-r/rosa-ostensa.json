    "intro": "Rosa ostensa, commonly known as the Alpine rose, is a species of flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has fragrant, single or semi-double petals and is often used in rock gardens due to its hardiness and ornamental value. Rosa ostensa thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for alpine and subalpine habitats. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for gardeners interested in cultivating plants with both aesthetic and ecological benefits."
