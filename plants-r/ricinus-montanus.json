    "intro": "Ricinus montanus, commonly known as the mountain castor, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America. It is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves and striking red or orange flowers. The plant produces small, spiny capsules that contain toxic seeds, which are a key feature of its botanical profile. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or disturbed habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, Ricinus montanus is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
