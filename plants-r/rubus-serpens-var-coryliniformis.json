    "intro": "Rubus serpens var. coryliniformis, commonly known as the red sandalwood raspberry, is a variant of the Rubus genus native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It is a shrub characterized by its trailing growth habit and thorny stems, often found in moist, shaded environments. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or orange in color, which are edible but have a tart flavor. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the plant is known for its ornamental value in horticulture. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is relatively rare and often considered a conservation concern."
