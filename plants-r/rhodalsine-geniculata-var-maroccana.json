    "intro": "Rhodalsine geniculata var. maroccana, commonly known as the Moroccan rhodalsine, is a rare and endemic plant native to the Atlas Mountains of Morocco. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, elliptical leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the arid and semi-arid conditions of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
