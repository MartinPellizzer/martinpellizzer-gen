    "intro": "Rhynchosia balansae var. psilantha, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cowpea, is a climbing legume native to tropical regions of Africa. It features trifoliate leaves with narrow, lance-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellow flowers that develop into elongated, pod-like fruits. The plant is characterized by its slender stem and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fallow fields. It is valued for its edible seeds, which are used in traditional cuisines, and for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. The varietal form psilantha distinguishes it by its more slender leaves compared to the typical variety."
