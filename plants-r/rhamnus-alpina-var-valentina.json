    "intro": "Rhamnus alpina var. valentina, commonly known as the Alpine buckthorn, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving at high elevations with cool, moist conditions. The plant features small, oval leaves that are often covered in a fine pubescence, and it produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring. Its berries are dark red to black and are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. The species is valued for its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil in challenging terrains."
