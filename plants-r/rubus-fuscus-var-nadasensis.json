    "intro": "Rubus fuscus var. nadasensis, commonly known as the Nadaseni blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to southeastern Europe. It is a shrub characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically harvested in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and locally significant species in its native habitat."
