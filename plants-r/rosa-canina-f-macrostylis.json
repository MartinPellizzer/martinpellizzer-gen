    "intro": "Rosa canina f. macrostylis, commonly known as the large-styled dog rose, is a botanical variant of the dog rose (Rosa canina). It is characterized by its enlarged, showy stamens that give it a distinctive appearance. This form is typically found in the wild and is less commonly cultivated than the standard dog rose. The plant produces pale pink to white flowers with a sweet, fruity fragrance. It is a shrub with thorny stems and dark green, lobed leaves, and it is known for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in various soil conditions."
