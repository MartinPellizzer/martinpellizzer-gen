    "intro": "Ranunculus transalaicus, commonly known as the Transalpine buttercup, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, showy yellow flowers with a distinctive central crown. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, preferring well-drained soils and sunny exposures. Its leaves are palmately divided, and the flowers bloom in early spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
