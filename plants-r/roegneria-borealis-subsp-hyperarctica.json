    "intro": "Roegneria borealis subsp. hyperarctica, commonly known as the Arctic false brome, is a perennial grass species native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear pale blue to greenish flowers, which are adapted to pollinate in cold climates. It thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and alpine environments. Its botanical features reflect its adaptation to extreme environmental conditions, making it a resilient component of Arctic vegetation."
