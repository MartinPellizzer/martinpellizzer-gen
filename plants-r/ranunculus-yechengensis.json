It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, palmate leaves and showy yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as mountainous regions and forest understories. Its flowers bloom in early spring, adding a splash of color to its natural habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
