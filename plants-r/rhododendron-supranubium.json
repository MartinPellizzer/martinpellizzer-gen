    "intro": "Rhododendron supranubium, commonly known as the cloud summit rhododendron, is a rare and striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and vibrant, showy flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at elevations above 3,000 meters. Its flowers are usually pink to purple in color, with five petals and a distinctive, recurved shape. Due to its limited habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species."
