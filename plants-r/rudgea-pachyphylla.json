    "intro": "Rudgea pachyphylla, commonly known as the thick-leaved rudgea, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its large, thick, waxy leaves that help it conserve water in its typically arid habitat. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, often in inflorescences that bloom in spring. Rudgea pachyphylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
