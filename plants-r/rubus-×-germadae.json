    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 germadae, commonly known as the blackberry raspberry hybrid, is a polyploid plant resulting from the cross between blackberries (Rubus fruticosus) and raspberries (Rubus idaeus). It exhibits characteristics of both parent species, featuring thorny stems and aggregate fruits that are typically reddish or black in color. The plant is perennial, growing as a shrub with compound leaves and numerous small flowers that bloom in the spring. Its fruits are edible, though often tart, and are used in culinary applications. The hybrid is valued for its hardiness and adaptability to various climates."
