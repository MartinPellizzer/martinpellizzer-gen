    "intro": "Rhododendron brachycarpum var. nemotoanum, commonly known as the Japanese rhododendron, is a compact evergreen shrub native to Japan. It features dense, dark green foliage that provides a lush backdrop for its showy, bell-shaped flowers. The blooms, which appear in late spring, are typically pink to reddish-purple and are borne in clusters. This variety is well-suited for rock gardens and shaded areas due to its preference for acidic, well-drained soil. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to thrive in cooler climates and its relatively low maintenance requirements."
