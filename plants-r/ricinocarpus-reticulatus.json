    "intro": "Ricinocarpus reticulatus, commonly known as the net-veined senna, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves with a distinctive reticulate venation pattern. The plant produces yellowish or pale green flowers arranged in racemes, which are often followed by flat, pod-like fruits. Its seeds contain toxic compounds, including ricin, making it a potentially hazardous species. Despite its toxicity, it is sometimes used in traditional medicine, though with caution."
