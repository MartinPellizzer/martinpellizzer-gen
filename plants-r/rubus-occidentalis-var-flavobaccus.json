    "intro": "Rubus occidentalis var. flavobaccus, commonly known as the yellow raspberry, is a variant of the common blackberry native to western North America. It is characterized by its yellow to orange-red fruit, which differs from the typical dark red or black berries of the main species. The plant produces compound leaves with three to five leaflets, and its flowers are usually white or pale pink. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. This variety is valued for its unique fruit color and flavor, making it a popular choice for cultivation in gardens and small-scale farming."
