    "intro": "Rhinanthus elatus, commonly known as the yellow rattle, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, which includes parasitic and semi-parasitic plants. The plant is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom from June to August. It typically grows in grasslands and disturbed soils, often forming dense colonies. Its semi-parasitic nature allows it to draw nutrients from the roots of nearby plants, contributing to the ecological balance of its habitat."
