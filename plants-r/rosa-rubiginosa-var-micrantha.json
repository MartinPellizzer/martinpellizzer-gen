    "intro": "Rosa rubiginosa var. micrantha, commonly known as the alpine rose, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with small, dark green leaves and fragrant, pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, orange-red hips that are rich in vitamin C and are often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays."
