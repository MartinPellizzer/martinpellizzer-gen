It is characterized by its hairy, rough-textured stems and dark, edible berries. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or along stream banks. Its leaves are compound, with three to five leaflets, and its flowers are small, white, and clustered in inflorescences. The fruit is generally smaller than typical blackberries and has a more tart flavor."
