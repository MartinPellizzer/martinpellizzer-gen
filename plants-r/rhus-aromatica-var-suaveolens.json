    "intro": "Rhus aromatica var. suaveolens, commonly known as sweet gum, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and distinctive, palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant colors in the fall. The tree produces small, spiny fruits that contain three-winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its fragrant, yellowish-green flowers appear in spring and are followed by ornamental, lantern-shaped seedpods. Sweet gum is valued in landscaping for its aesthetic appeal and adaptability to various soil types."
