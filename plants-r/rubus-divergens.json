    "intro": "Rubus divergens, commonly known as the spreading blackberry, is a species of bramble native to North America. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and thorny stems, which help it to climb and spread across the ground. The plant produces aggregate fruits, known as blackberries, which are typically dark purple to black in color when mature. Its leaves are compound, with three to five leaflets that are serrated along the edges. Rubus divergens thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and forest edges."
