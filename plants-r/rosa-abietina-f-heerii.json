    "intro": "Rosa abietina f. heerii, commonly known as the Alpine rose or mountain rose, is a subspecies of the shrub rose native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense, evergreen foliage that remains vibrant throughout the year. The plant produces fragrant, single or semi-double flowers in shades of pink to white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is well adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
