    "intro": "Ruppia maritima, commonly known as sea rocket or widgeon grass, is a flowering plant that thrives in brackish and saltwater environments. It is a halophyte, meaning it has adapted to grow in saline conditions, often found in coastal marshes and estuaries. The plant has small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by small, oval-shaped seeds. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it can grow in both submerged and emergent habitats. Ruppia maritima plays an important ecological role by providing food and habitat for various aquatic and coastal wildlife."
