It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark red to black in color. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in moist, woodland areas. Its botanical features make it a valuable plant for both ecological and agricultural purposes."
