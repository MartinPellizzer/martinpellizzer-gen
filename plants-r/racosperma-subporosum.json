It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant has a fibrous root system that helps it thrive in nutrient-poor soils, and it produces small, woody pods that contain seeds. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological studies and horticultural applications."
