    "intro": "Rebutia major, commonly known as the giant stonecress, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its fleshy, branching stems that store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or white during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are typically small and thick, adapted to reduce water loss through transpiration. Rebutia major is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and hardy nature."
