It features striking violet to purple flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, rounded bulbs that store nutrients for the next growing season. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its unique coloration and compact growth habit."
