It is characterized by its dark purple to black berries, which are typically small and covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant produces compound leaves with serrated edges and thorned stems, typical of many Rubus species. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, appearing in clusters before the fruit develops. This variant is valued for its unique flavor and is often cultivated for both ornamental and culinary purposes."
