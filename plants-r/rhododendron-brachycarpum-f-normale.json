    "intro": "Rhododendron brachycarpum f. normale, commonly known as the dwarf rhododendron, is a compact shrub native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It features dense, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and slightly elliptical in shape. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, blooming in early spring. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soil and prefers partial to full shade, making it suitable for shaded garden beds. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its neat growth habit and extended flowering period."
