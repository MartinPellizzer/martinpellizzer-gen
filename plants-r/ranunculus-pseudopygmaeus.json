It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family, which includes many showy and often toxic species. The plant typically grows to a height of less than 10 centimeters, featuring delicate, palmate leaves and bright yellow flowers with numerous petals. It thrives in moist, rocky habitats and is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
