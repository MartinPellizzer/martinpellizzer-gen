    "intro": "Rubus fuscidulus, commonly known as the pale bramble, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is native to eastern North America and is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in the spring, followed by red or orange berries in the fall. It thrives in moist, wooded areas and is often found in the understory of forests. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions."
