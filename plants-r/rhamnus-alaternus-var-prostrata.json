    "intro": "Rhamnus alaternus var. prostrata, commonly known as creeping buckthorn, is a low-growing shrub native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It features small, oval leaves that are typically dark green and have a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are followed by dark blue-black berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in landscaping for erosion control."
