    "intro": "Rhododendron nepalense, commonly known as the Nepal rhododendron, is a species native to the Himalayas, particularly in Nepal, Bhutan, and northern India. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows in moist, acidic soils at high elevations. The plant produces striking clusters of pink to red flowers in the spring, which are followed by leathery, elliptical leaves. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological importance in mountainous regions. Rhododendron nepalense plays a significant role in the local flora and is often found in forested areas at altitudes between 1,500 and 3,500 meters."
