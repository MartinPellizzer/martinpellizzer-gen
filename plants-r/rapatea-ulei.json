    "intro": "Rapatea ulei, commonly known as the Hawaiian fern, is a species native to the tropical regions of the Pacific, particularly Hawaii. It belongs to the Marantaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-like arrangement of lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a waxy texture, which helps retain moisture in humid conditions. Rapatea ulei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its unique foliage."
