    "intro": "Rosa canina subsp. dumetorum, commonly known as the bramble rose, is a shrub native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems, alternate leaves with serrated edges, and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces red, hairy fruits called hips, which are rich in vitamin C and used in traditional medicine. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including hedgerows, woodlands, and rocky areas, and is often found in disturbed soils. Its hardy nature makes it a common sight in many temperate regions."
