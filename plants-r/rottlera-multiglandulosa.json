    "intro": "Rottlera multiglandulosa, commonly known as the multiglandular rottlera, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, woody stems and opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves with prominent venation. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are often fragrant and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. Rottlera multiglandulosa is valued in traditional medicine for its potential pharmacological properties."
