    "intro": "Rosa alpina-laevis, commonly known as the alpine smooth rose, is a species of flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its simple, smooth stems and small, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant thrives in alpine environments, where it adapts to harsh conditions with its low-growing habit and dense foliage. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold, dry climates. Rosa alpina-laevis plays an important ecological role in alpine ecosystems, providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for small invertebrates."
