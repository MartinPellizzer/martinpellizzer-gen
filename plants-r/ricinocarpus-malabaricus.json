    "intro": "Ricinocarpus malabaricus, commonly known as the Indian sandalwood tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Western Ghats of India. It belongs to the family Fabaceae and is characterized by its dense, aromatic wood that is highly valued for its fragrance and durability. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers and pod-like fruits that contain flat, winged seeds. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in moist evergreen forests. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered an endangered species."
