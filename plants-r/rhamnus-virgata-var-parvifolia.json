It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically less than 2 cm in length, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruit is a small, dark reddish-brown drupe that ripens in late summer. The plant is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to thrive in arid conditions."
