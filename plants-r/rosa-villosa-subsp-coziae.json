    "intro": "Rosa villosa subsp. coziae, commonly known as Cozze's shrub rose, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its thorny stems, ovate to elliptical leaves with a hairy underside, and clusters of fragrant, pink to white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or well-drained soils and is adapted to temperate climates. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and hardiness, though it is less commonly cultivated than other rose species."
