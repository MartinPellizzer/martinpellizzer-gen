    "intro": "Rorippa islandica subsp. fernaldiana, commonly known as the Alaska sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is a low-growing herb that typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils, often found in tundra and alpine environments. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early summer. Its leaves are alternate, linear, and often covered with a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in cold climates. This subspecies is notable for its adaptability to harsh environmental conditions and its role in stabilizing soil in polar ecosystems."
