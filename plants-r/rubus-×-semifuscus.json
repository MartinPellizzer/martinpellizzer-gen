It is a hybrid between Rubus ursinus (blackberry) and Rubus loganobaccus (loganberry), resulting in a plant with unique botanical characteristics. The plant produces dark purple to black berries that are typically larger and sweeter than those of its parent species. Its foliage consists of trifoliate leaves with serrated edges, and it thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil. The hybrid is valued for its ornamental appeal and edible fruits, making it a popular choice for both cultivation and research."
