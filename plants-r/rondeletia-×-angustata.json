It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or red, which attract pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. It thrives in shaded to partially shaded environments and prefers moist, well-drained soil. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for garden cultivation in tropical and subtropical regions."
