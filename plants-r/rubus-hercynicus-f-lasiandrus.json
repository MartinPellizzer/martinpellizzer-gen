    "intro": "Rubus hercynicus f. lasiandrus, commonly known as the hairy blackberry, is a subspecies of the blackberry plant native to central and eastern Europe. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and large, dark purple to black berries that ripen in late summer. The leaves are typically oval-shaped with serrated edges and a hairy texture, contributing to its common name. This plant thrives in woodland edges and disturbed soils, preferring partial shade to full sun. Its fruit is often used in jams and pies, though it is less commonly cultivated than other blackberry varieties."
