    "intro": "Ranunculus subalpinus, commonly known as the alpine buttercup, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, yellow flowers with five petals and a hairy stem that helps it withstand cold temperatures. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky habitats at high elevations. Its leaves are palmately divided and covered in fine hairs, which aid in reducing water loss. Ranunculus subalpinus is an important component of alpine ecosystems, providing nectar for pollinators and contributing to biodiversity in harsh environments."
