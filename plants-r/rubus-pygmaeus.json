    "intro": "Rubus pygmaeus, commonly known as the dwarf raspberry, is a small shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Rubus genus within the Rosaceae family, characterized by its thorny stems and aggregate fruits. The plant typically grows at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, temperate climates with well-drained soils. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, and the berries, though small, are edible and have a tart flavor. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
