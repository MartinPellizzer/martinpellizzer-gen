    "intro": "Rubus schleicheri var. humifusiformis, commonly known as the creeping blackberry, is a low-growing shrub native to Southeast Asia. It produces small, dark red to black berries that are typically eaten by birds and other wildlife. The plant has woody stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three ovate to elliptic leaflets. This variety is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth."
