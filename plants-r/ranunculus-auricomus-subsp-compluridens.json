    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus subsp. compluridens, commonly known as the many-seeded buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It features showy, yellow flowers with prominent, rounded sepals that resemble petals. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss. The subspecies is distinguished by its numerous seeds and a more robust growth habit compared to other ranunculus species."
