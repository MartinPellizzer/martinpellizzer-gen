    "intro": "Rosa sempervirens var. bicknellii, commonly known as Bicknell's evergreen rose, is a rare and hardy shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery foliage that remains throughout the winter, giving it its \"evergreen\" designation. The plant produces fragrant, pinkish-white flowers in late spring to early summer. It has a compact growth habit and is often found in moist, acidic soils along stream banks and in woodlands. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a threatened species in some regions."
