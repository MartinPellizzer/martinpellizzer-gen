    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus subsp. albertsonii, commonly known as the Albertson's buttercup, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its bright yellow petals and deeply lobed leaves, typical of the Ranunculaceae family. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and streambanks. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
