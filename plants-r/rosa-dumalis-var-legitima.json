    "intro": "Rosa dumalis var. legitima, commonly known as the Alaska rose, is a shrub-like plant native to the subarctic regions of North America. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it forms thickets that provide habitat for local wildlife. Its leaves are dark green and slightly hairy, while its fruit is a red, hairy rosehip that ripens in autumn. This variety is notable for its hardiness and ability to thrive in harsh, cold climates."
