    "intro": "Rhus coddii, commonly known as the California buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to the coastal regions of California. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 3 to 5 inches long and have a serrated edge. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by reddish-orange berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. Rhus coddii thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in chaparral and coastal scrub habitats. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and ecologically significant species in its native range."
