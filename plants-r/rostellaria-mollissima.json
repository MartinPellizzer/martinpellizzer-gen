    "intro": "Rostellaria mollissima, commonly known as the velvet rostellaria, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its soft, hairy leaves and striking, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant prefers shaded, humid environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the forest floor, and it plays a role in the ecosystem by providing nectar for pollinators. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
