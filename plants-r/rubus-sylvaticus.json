    "intro": "Rubus sylvaticus, commonly known as bramble or blackberry bush, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves, which are typically trifoliate or pinnate. The plant produces clusters of small white flowers in early summer, which are followed by edible blackberries in late summer. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including woodlands, hedgerows, and disturbed soils. Rubus sylvaticus plays an important role in supporting local wildlife, providing food and shelter for birds and insects."
