    "intro": "Rhododendron nanum, commonly known as the dwarf rhododendron, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It features dense, leathery foliage with broad, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or white during the spring season. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Due to its compact size and ornamental value, it is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover in shaded areas."
