    "intro": "Rubus fuscus, commonly known as the blackberry bramble, is a species of flowering plant in the\u8537\u8587\u79d1 (Rosaceae) family. It is native to Europe and parts of western Asia, typically found in woodland edges, hedgerows, and disturbed soils. The plant is a perennial shrub that produces small, dark red or black berries, which are edible but often considered tart. Its leaves are compound, with three to five leaflets, and it has thorny stems that help in its identification. Rubus fuscus plays a role in supporting local wildlife, including birds and insects, due to its berries and foliage."
