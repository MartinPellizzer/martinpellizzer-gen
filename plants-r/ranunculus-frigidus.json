    "intro": "Ranunculus frigidus, commonly known as the Arctic buttercup, is a low-growing perennial plant native to cold regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically thrives in alpine and arctic environments, where it forms dense mats on rocky or sandy soils. The plant features small, bright yellow flowers with five petals, often surrounded by sepals that resemble additional petals. Its leaves are deeply lobed and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh climates. Ranunculus frigidus plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and provides nectar for pollinators in its brief flowering season."
