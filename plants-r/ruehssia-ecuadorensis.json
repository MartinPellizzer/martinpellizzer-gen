    "intro": "Ruehssia ecuadorensis, commonly known as the Ecuadorian ruehssia, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of Ecuador. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest understories, preferring high humidity and well-drained soil. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a smooth texture, while its flowers are usually white or pale green. Ruehssia ecuadorensis is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution in its native habitat."
