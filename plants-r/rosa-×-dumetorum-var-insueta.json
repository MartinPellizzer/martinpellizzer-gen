    "intro": "Rosa \u00d7 dumetorum var. insueta, commonly known as the alpine rose, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense foliage, with small, often pink or white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is known for its ability to thrive in harsh, alpine conditions, tolerating cold temperatures and poor soil. Its leaves are typically trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it produces hip fruits that contain numerous seeds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in rocky, high-altitude environments."
