    "intro": "Rapistrum glandulosum, commonly known as the woolly knotweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and hairy, glandular stems and leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found along riverbanks and in wet meadows. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively, it can become invasive in certain regions."
