    "intro": "Rhus syriaca, commonly known as smooth sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern and central United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and turn bright red in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in upright clusters, followed by red, fuzzy berries that are a food source for birds. Smooth sumac is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in open woods, fields, and along roadsides. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological studies and traditional medicine."
