    "intro": "Rosa alpina var. pilosula, commonly known as the Alpine rose or alpine rock rose, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and dense clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant features dark green, leathery leaves with a slightly hairy texture, which helps it withstand cold and arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or alpine environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in colder climates."
