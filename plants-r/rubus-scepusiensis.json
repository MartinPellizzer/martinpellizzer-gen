    "intro": "Rubus scepusiensis, commonly known as the Scepusian blackberry, is a species of brambles native to the Caucasus region. It is characterized by its thorny stems and aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black in color. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by the development of its edible berries. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges and shrublands. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and lesser-known member of the Rubus genus."
