    "intro": "Rubus hirtifolius, commonly known as the hairy-leaved blackberry, is a species of bramble native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its thorny stems and trifoliate leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces aggregate fruits that mature to a deep black color, often with a slight white bloom. It thrives in moist, wooded areas and is often found in the understory of deciduous forests. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
