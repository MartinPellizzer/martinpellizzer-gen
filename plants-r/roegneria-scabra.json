    "intro": "Roegneria scabra, commonly known as the rough fescue, is a cool-season grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its coarse, bluish-green foliage and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed sites such as roadsides, meadows, and pastures. Its leaves are usually covered with short, stiff hairs, giving it a rough texture. Roegneria scabra is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping and erosion control."
