    "intro": "Rubus fruticosus var. pallidus, commonly known as the pale bramble, is a perennial shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces small, tart berries that are typically edible but often used in jams and wines. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, acidic conditions. The pale bramble is often found in hedgerows, woodlands, and disturbed areas, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife."
