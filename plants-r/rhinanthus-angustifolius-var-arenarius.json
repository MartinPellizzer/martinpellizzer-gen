    "intro": "Rhinanthus angustifolius var. arenarius, commonly known as the sand everlasting or sand rhinoceros flower, is a flowering plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in open habitats such as heathlands and coastal dunes. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
