    "intro": "Rotheca tanneri, commonly known as the Tanner's rotheca, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows as a low, sprawling shrub with hairy, gray-green leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its flowers are small and yellow, arranged in clusters, and bloom during the warmer months. Rotheca tanneri is adapted to survive in dry conditions, making it a resilient component of desert ecosystems."
