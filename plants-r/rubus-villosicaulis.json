    "intro": "Rubus villosicaulis, commonly known as the downy bramble, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is native to parts of North America and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and thorny stems. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, juicy berries in the summer. Its leaves are trifoliate, with a hairy texture that gives it its common name. Rubus villosicaulis is often found in woodland edges and disturbed areas, where it thrives in partial shade."
