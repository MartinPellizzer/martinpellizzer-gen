    "intro": "Rosa canina f. elegans, commonly known as the elegant dog rose, is a cultivated form of the common dog rose, characterized by its more refined floral appearance. It features semi-double to double pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a spreading habit with thorny stems and dark green, trifoliate leaves. Its hips, like those of the common dog rose, are edible and used in culinary and medicinal applications. It is often grown in gardens for its ornamental value and historical significance in horticulture."
