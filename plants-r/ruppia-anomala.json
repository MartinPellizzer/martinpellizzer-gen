    "intro": "Ruppia anomala, commonly known as sea rocket, is a halophytic plant that thrives in brackish water environments such as estuaries and coastal marshes. It has small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like. The plant is adapted to tolerate high salinity and fluctuating water levels, which are common in its natural habitat. Ruppia anomala plays a role in stabilizing sediment and providing habitat for aquatic organisms. It is also used in some regions as a traditional food source."
