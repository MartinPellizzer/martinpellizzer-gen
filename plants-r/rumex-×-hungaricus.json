    "intro": "Rumex \u00d7 hungaricus, commonly known as the Hungarian sorrel, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Rumex acetosa (common sorrel) and Rumex acetobulus (broad-leafed sorrel). It is a perennial herb characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of bright yellow flowers. The plant thrives in moist, fertile soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its leaves are edible, though they contain oxalic acid and should be cooked before consumption. The species is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in traditional medicine."
