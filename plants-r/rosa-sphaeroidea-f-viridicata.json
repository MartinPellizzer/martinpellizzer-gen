    "intro": "Rosa sphaeroidea f. viridicata, commonly known as the green-leafed rose, is a unique horticultural form of the species Rosa sphaeroidea. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green foliage, which contrasts strikingly with its pale pink to white flowers. The plant is a shrub with thorny stems and is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or containers. Its ornamental value lies in its foliage as much as its flowers, offering a distinctive visual appeal in gardens."
