    "intro": "Rosa glauca var. subvenosa, commonly known as the blue rose or blue shrub rose, is a hybrid rose species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its pale blue or lavender-colored flowers, which are often described as having a subtle, ethereal hue. The plant typically grows as a shrub with arching stems and dark green foliage that provides a striking contrast to its floral display. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for garden cultivation. Due to its ornamental value and unique coloration, it is often grown for both its aesthetic appeal and its ability to attract pollinators."
