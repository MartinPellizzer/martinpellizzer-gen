    "intro": "Rubus kaltenbachii var. erythradenes, commonly known as the red-fruited blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry genus native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is characterized by its dark purple to black berries, which are typically small and have a slightly tart flavor. The plant produces compound leaves with serrated edges and grows as an upright shrub with thorny stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and edible fruits, though it is less commonly cultivated than other blackberry species."
