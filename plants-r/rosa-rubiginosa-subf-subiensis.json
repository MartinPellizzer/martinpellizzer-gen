    "intro": "Rosa rubiginosa subf. subiensis, commonly known as the subalpine rose, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Its leaves are typically gray-green with a fuzzy texture, and its hips produce orange-red berries that are an important food source for wildlife. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in alpine ecosystems."
