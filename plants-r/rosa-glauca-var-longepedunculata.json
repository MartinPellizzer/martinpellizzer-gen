    "intro": "Rosa glauca var. longepedunculata, commonly known as the long peduncled blue rose, is a variant of the blue rose species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. This plant is characterized by its striking deep blue petals, which are a result of a unique genetic mutation affecting pigmentation. It produces slender, elongated peduncles that support its clusters of fragrant flowers, adding to its ornamental appeal. The plant typically grows as a shrub with thorny stems and dark green, serrated leaves. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a desirable addition to rock gardens and alpine landscapes."
