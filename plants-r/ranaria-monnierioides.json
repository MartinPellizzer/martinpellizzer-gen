    "intro": "Ranaria monnierioides, commonly known as the creeping liverwort, is a species of non-vascular plant belonging to the family Marchantiaceae. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rock crevices. The plant features a thalloid body with distinct lobes and is often covered in tiny, water-retaining structures called rhizoids. It reproduces via spores, which are released from specialized capsules known as sporangia. Ranaria monnierioides plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various invertebrates."
