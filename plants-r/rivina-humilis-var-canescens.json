    "intro": "Rivina humilis var. canescens, commonly known as the hairy rivina, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, woody stems covered in fine, grayish hairs, which give it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, white, tubular flowers that bloom in the spring and summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a slightly hairy texture. This variety is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partial shade to full sun."
