    "intro": "Rosa pendulina f. pyrenaica, commonly known as the Pyrenean weeping rose, is a botanical variant of the pendulina rose, characterized by its cascading, drooping branches. It originates from the Pyrenees region and is noted for its delicate, fragrant pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has narrow, dark green leaves and is adapted to grow in well-drained, acidic soils. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its elegant appearance and is relatively hardy in temperate climates. However, it requires protection from strong winds and is best suited for sheltered garden locations."
