It is characterized by its delicate, palmate leaves and vibrant yellow flowers with numerous stamens. This fern-like plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in mountainous regions. Its flowers typically bloom in spring, adding a striking visual element to its natural habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical study and conservation efforts."
