    "intro": "Ranunculus marschlinsii, commonly known as the marsh buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to central and eastern Europe. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils along stream banks and wet meadows. The plant features a basal rosette of pinnately lobed leaves and produces showy yellow flowers with five to seven sepals. It blooms from late spring to early summer, and its flowers are often visited by bees and other pollinators. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
