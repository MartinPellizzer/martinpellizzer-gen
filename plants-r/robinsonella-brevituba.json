It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant has a pseudobulb structure, which helps it store water and nutrients, adapting it to its often humid and shaded habitats. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, contributing to its overall streamlined appearance. This orchid is often found growing in rocky crevices or on tree trunks, showcasing its ability to thrive in challenging environments."
