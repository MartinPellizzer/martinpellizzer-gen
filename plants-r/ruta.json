    "intro": "Ruta, commonly known as rue, is a flowering plant belonging to the Rutaceae family. It is characterized by its aromatic, pinnately compound leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in well-drained soil and full sun. Its leaves contain volatile oils that contribute to its strong, peppery scent. Ruta is often used in traditional medicine and as a culinary herb, though it should be handled with care due to its potential toxicity."
