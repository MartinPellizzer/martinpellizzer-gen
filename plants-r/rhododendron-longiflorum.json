    "intro": "Rhododendron longiflorum, commonly known as the purple leek or purple cowberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of western China. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, dark green leaves and clusters of fragrant, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to deep purple. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing nectar that attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Rhododendron longiflorum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for its striking floral display."
