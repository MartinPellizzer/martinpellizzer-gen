    "intro": "Ranunculus pedatifidus subsp. turczaninovii, commonly known as the Turczaninov's buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features showy, yellow flowers with five to nine broadly ovate petals, typically arranged in a cup-like formation. The plant has finely divided, trifoliate leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
