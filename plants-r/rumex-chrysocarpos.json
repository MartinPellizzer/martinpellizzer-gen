    "intro": "Rumex chrysocarpos, commonly known as golden sandwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to dry, sandy soils in the western United States. It has upright, branched stems with alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in compact clusters during the spring and early summer. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor environments. The species is notable for its ability to thrive in arid conditions and is often found in disturbed or open habitats."
