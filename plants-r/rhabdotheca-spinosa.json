It features a short, woody stem with dense clusters of spiny, cylindrical leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers during the summer months, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits. It is adapted to arid environments and requires well-draining soil and minimal water. Rhabdotheca spinosa is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and resilience."
