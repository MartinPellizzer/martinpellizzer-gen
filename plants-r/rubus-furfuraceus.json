    "intro": "Rubus furfuraceus, commonly known as the rough raspberry, is a species of bramble native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its thorny stems and trifoliate leaves, which are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, fuzzy hairs. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are usually red or yellow in color, resembling raspberries in appearance. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in moist, shaded areas such as forests or along stream banks. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions."
