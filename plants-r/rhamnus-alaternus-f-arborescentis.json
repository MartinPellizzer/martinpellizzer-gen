    "intro": "Rhamnus alaternus f. arborescentis, commonly known as the tree form of the common buckthorn, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Europe. It features dark green, oval-shaped leaves that are glossy and often have a slight waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by dark blue berries that are rich in anthocyanins. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or rocky areas. Due to its hardy nature, it can become invasive in some regions if not managed properly."
