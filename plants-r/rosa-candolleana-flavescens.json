    "intro": "Rosa candolleana flavescens, commonly known as the yellow-flowered rose, is a species native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow petals and fragrant aroma, which are typical features of many rose species. The plant produces small, oval-shaped fruits known as rosehips, which contain seeds enclosed in a hairy covering. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and requires full sun for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and by horticulturists."
