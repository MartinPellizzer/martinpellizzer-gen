    "intro": "Raphia hookeri var. rubrifolia, commonly known as the red-leafed fan palm, is a striking tropical plant native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, fan-shaped leaves that exhibit a distinctive red or reddish-brown coloration on the underside, especially when young. The plant grows as a single trunk with a crown of broad, segmented leaves that can reach several meters in length. It thrives in humid, warm climates with high rainfall and well-drained soil. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in tropical gardens and as a houseplant in cooler regions."
