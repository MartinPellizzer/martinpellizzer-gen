It is characterized by its striking violet to purple flowers and trifoliate leaves, which are typical of the Fabaceae family. The plant produces elongated pods that contain several seeds, and it is often cultivated for its edible beans. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is well adapted to poor soils, making it a resilient agricultural crop. Additionally, it plays a role in nitrogen fixation, improving soil fertility in agroecosystems."
