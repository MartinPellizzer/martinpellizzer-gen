    "intro": "Rosa abietina f. uriensis, commonly known as the Alpine rose or the mountain rose, is a botanical variant of the Rosa abietina species. It is a shrub native to the alpine regions of Europe, particularly in the Alps and Carpathian mountains. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit, with small, dark green leaves and clusters of fragrant, pink to red flowers. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in cooler climates."
