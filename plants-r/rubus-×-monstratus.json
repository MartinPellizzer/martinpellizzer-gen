    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 monstratus, commonly known as the hybrid blackberry raspberry, is a deciduous shrub belonging to the Rosaceae family. It is a natural hybrid between Rubus ursinus (the blackberry) and Rubus idaeus (the raspberry), resulting in a plant with unique characteristics. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or black in color, with a tart flavor. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil. Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits variability in growth habits and fruit quality."
