    "intro": "Rhaponticum davuricum, commonly known as the Siberian rhubarb, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a robust rhizome system that allows it to thrive in cold climates and poor soils. The plant produces large, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in diameter. Its flowers are yellow and borne in clusters, typically appearing in late summer. It is valued for its edible rhizomes, which have a tart flavor similar to common rhubarb."
