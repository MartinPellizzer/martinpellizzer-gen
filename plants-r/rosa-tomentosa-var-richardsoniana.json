    "intro": "Rosa tomentosa var. richardsoniana, commonly known as the Richardson's woolly rose, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its dense, grayish-white pubescence covering the stems and leaves, which provides a woolly appearance. The plant produces showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its foliage is typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a leathery texture. This variety is well adapted to rocky and dry habitats, making it a hardy and resilient ornamental plant."
