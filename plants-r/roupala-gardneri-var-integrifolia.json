    "intro": "Roupala gardneri var. integrifolia, commonly known as the smooth-leaved roupala, is a species native to the Pacific Islands. It is a small evergreen tree or shrub characterized by its simple, smooth-edged leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by round, fleshy fruits that are often eaten by birds. It thrives in coastal and lowland forest habitats, preferring well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
