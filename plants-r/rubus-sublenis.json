    "intro": "Rubus sublenis, commonly known as the soft-stemmed blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and compound leaves with three to five leaflets. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that ripen to a dark purple or black color, typically in late summer. Its flowers are white or pale pink, and it is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant is valued for its edible fruits and its role in supporting local wildlife."
