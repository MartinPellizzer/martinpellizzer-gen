    "intro": "Rosa pendulina f. pimpinelliformis, commonly known as the creeping rose or the climbing rose, is a botanical variant of the Rosa pendulina species. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and the production of fragrant, semi-double pink flowers. The plant features slender, wiry stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground or climb supports. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three oval-shaped leaflets, and it is typically found in moist, shady environments. This form is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to create dense ground cover."
