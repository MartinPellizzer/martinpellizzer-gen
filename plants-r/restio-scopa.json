    "intro": "Restio scopa, commonly known as the narrowleaf restio, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Restionaceae family, which includes many grass-like plants adapted to Mediterranean climates. The plant has slender, grass-like stems and produces small, white or pale blue flowers in dense spikes. Its leaves are narrow and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in dry conditions. Restio scopa is typically found in open, sunny habitats such as fynbos vegetation."
