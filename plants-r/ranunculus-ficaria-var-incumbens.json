It is characterized by its low-growing, spreading habit and bright yellow flowers with five petals. The leaves are typically trifoliate, with three deeply lobed leaflets. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. This variant is distinguished by its slightly smaller flowers and more compact growth compared to other ranunculus species."
