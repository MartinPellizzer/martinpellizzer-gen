    "intro": "Rabdochloa polystachyos, commonly known as the clustered lespedeza, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its upright growth habit and compound leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink to red in color, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a hardy perennial suitable for native gardens and erosion control. Its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with soil bacteria also contributes to its ecological importance."
