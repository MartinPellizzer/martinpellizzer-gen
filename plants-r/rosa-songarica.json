    "intro": "Rosa songarica, commonly known as the Songarica rose, is a species of shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of fragrant, semi-double pink flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or arid environments, showcasing its adaptability to harsh conditions. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with serrated edges, and its roots are deep, allowing it to survive in nutrient-poor soils. Rosa songarica is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its historical use in traditional medicine."
