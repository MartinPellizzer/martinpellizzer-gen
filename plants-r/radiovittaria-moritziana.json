It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically arranged in a compact rosette. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. Native to tropical regions, it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and botanical collections."
