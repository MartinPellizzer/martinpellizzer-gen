    "intro": "Rubus macrophyllus var. discolor, commonly known as the red-veined raspberry, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its large, lobed leaves that often display a striking red or purple venation. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers in the spring, which are followed by red or orange berries in the summer. Its fruit is edible, though it has a tart flavor and is often used in jams and desserts. The species is valued for its ornamental value and its role in supporting local wildlife."
