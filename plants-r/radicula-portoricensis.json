    "intro": "Radicula portoricensis, commonly known as the Puerto Rican radicle, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the island of Puerto Rico. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes caraway and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories and rocky crevices. Its leaves are compound, with finely divided lobes, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Radicula portoricensis is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
