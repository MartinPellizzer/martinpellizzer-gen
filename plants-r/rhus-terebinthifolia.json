    "intro": "Rhus terebinthifolia, commonly known as the winged sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged with narrow, wing-like leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by red, fuzzy fruits that are an important food source for wildlife. Its bark is smooth and grayish, becoming fissured with age, and it thrives in full sun to partial shade. Rhus terebinthifolia is often found in moist, acidic soils along streambanks and in forest edges."
