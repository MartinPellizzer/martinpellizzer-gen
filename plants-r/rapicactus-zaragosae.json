    "intro": "Rapicactus zaragosae, commonly known as the Zaragoza cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its compact, globular shape and dense covering of spines. The plant typically grows to a height of about 10\u201315 centimeters and features a thick, ribbed stem that stores water. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, emerging from areoles along the stem, and it thrives in full sun with minimal water. Due to its unique appearance and slow growth, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and cactus collections."
