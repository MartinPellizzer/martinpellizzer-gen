    "intro": "Rhododendron parryae, commonly known as Parry's rhododendron, is a shrub native to the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. It is often found in moist, mountainous regions where it contributes to the biodiversity of its ecosystem. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
