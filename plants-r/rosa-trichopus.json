    "intro": "Rosa trichopus, commonly known as the moss rose or swamp rose, is a deciduous shrub native to wetlands and stream banks in eastern North America. It features small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, arching stems covered in fine, silky hairs, which give it its scientific name \"trichopus,\" meaning \"hairy stem.\" Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating, aiding in water retention. Rosa trichopus is typically found in moist, acidic soils and is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological benefits."
