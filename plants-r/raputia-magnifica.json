    "intro": "Raputia magnifica, commonly known as the giant raputia, is a striking bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, showy inflorescence that can reach several feet in height, featuring vibrant red and orange bracts. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its leaves are long, narrow, and often have a waxy texture, which helps retain moisture. Raputia magnifica is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
