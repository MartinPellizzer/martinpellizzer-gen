    "intro": "Roegneria villosa subsp. laxe-pilosa, commonly known as the hairy false brome, is a grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and hairy leaves, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, two-lipped florets. Roegneria villosa subsp. laxe-pilosa is often found in open habitats such as meadows and slopes, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
