It typically grows in woodland edges, hedgerows, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. The plant features compound leaves with serrated edges and produces small, white to pale pink flowers in the spring. Its fruits are edible berries that are generally tart but can be used in jams and preserves.
