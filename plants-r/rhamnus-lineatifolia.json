    "intro": "Rhamnus lineatifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically green on top and pale underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by dark blue berries that are rich in anthocyanins. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in chaparral and woodland habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and natural landscapes."
