    "intro": "Roegneria czimganica var. variiglumis, commonly known as the variable wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green leaves that are typically shorter than the leaf sheaths. The plant produces dense clusters of spikelets, each bearing small, two-lobed florets that are often tinged with reddish hues. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is commonly found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a low-maintenance ground cover."
