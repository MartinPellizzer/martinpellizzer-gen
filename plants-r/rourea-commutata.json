    "intro": "Rourea commutata, commonly known as the silverleaf rourea, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in cup-like structures called cyathia, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in tropical gardens."
