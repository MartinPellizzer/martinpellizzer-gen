It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant features slender stems and lance-shaped leaves, with bright yellow flowers that are rich in nectar. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family, characterized by its parasitic or hemiparasitic nature. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and ecological significance in its native range."
