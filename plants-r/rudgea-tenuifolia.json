    "intro": "Rudgea tenuifolia, commonly known as slenderleaf rudgea, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its growth habit is typically shrub-like, with woody stems and a compact form, making it suitable for ornamental gardening in suitable climates. Rudgea tenuifolia is often found in moist, shaded areas of tropical forests, where it thrives in humid conditions."
