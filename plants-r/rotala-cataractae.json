    "intro": "Rotala cataractae, commonly known as the waterfall plant, is a species of aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves that are typically oval or elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, adding a subtle ornamental value. Rotala cataractae thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments and is often used in pond and aquarium settings. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense mats make it effective for water filtration and erosion control."
