    "intro": "Ranunculus lappaceus var. macrocarpellus, commonly known as the large-fruited water crowfoot, is a perennial aquatic plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It thrives in shallow freshwater habitats such as ponds, streams, and wet meadows. The plant has finely divided, floating leaves that are typically green with a waxy surface to reduce water loss. Its flowers are usually yellow with five petals and numerous stamens, and the fruit is a distinctive, large, multi-seeded achenes. The variety is characterized by its larger, more developed carpels compared to the typical form."
