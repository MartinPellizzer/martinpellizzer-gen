    "intro": "Ranunculus renifolius, commonly known as the lesser celandine, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features palmately divided leaves that are typically covered in a waxy, white coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces bright yellow flowers with five to eight petals, blooming in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats."
