    "intro": "Rubus trivialis var. duplaris, commonly known as the double-fruited blackberry, is a variant of the common blackberry plant. It is characterized by its unique ability to produce two distinct types of fruit on the same plant\u2014some berries are small and sour, while others are larger and sweeter. The plant is a shrub with thorny stems and compound leaves, typical of the Rubus genus. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils.
