    "intro": "Rubia cordifolia var. munjista, commonly known as Indian madder, is a perennial shrub native to the Himalayas and parts of South Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by dark red to black, elliptical berries. Its roots and stems contain high levels of anthraquinones, which have been used traditionally for dyeing textiles and in herbal medicine. This variety is particularly valued for its intense red dye, which has been used for centuries in natural dyeing practices."
