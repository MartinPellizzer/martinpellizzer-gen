    "intro": "Reynoutria, commonly known as giant hogweed, is a large herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia but now invasive in many regions of Europe and North America. It is characterized by its tall stature, reaching up to 5 meters in height, and its distinctive, umbrella-like white flowers. The plant has large, heart-shaped leaves with a hairy texture and a strong, unpleasant odor. Its stem is covered in coarse hairs and has purple spots, and it produces a milky sap that can cause severe skin irritation. Due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation, it is considered a significant ecological threat."
