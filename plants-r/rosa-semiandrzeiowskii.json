    "intro": "Rosa semiandrzeiowskii, commonly known as the Polish rose, is a rare and ancient species native to the Carpathian Mountains. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white. The plant has simple, alternate leaves with serrated edges, typical of many rose species. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
