    "intro": "Rhododendron fragariiflorum, commonly known as the strawberry leaf rhododendron, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its large, leathery leaves that resemble strawberry leaves, hence its common name. The plant produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to white, typically blooming in late spring. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Rhododendron fragariiflorum is often found in moist, forested areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
