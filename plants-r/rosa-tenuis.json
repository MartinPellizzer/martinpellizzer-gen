    "intro": "Rosa tenuis, commonly known as the slender rose, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is native to the eastern United States, particularly found in moist woodland areas and along stream banks. The plant is characterized by its thin, willow-like stems and small, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in late spring. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a serrated edge, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to wet soil conditions. Rosa tenuis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
