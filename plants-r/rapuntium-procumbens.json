    "intro": "Rapuntium procumbens, commonly known as creeping thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a low-growing, spreading habit with thick, woolly stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces pale purple to pink flowers that bloom in late summer, and its leaves are typically broad, lobed, and covered in stiff, bristly hairs. It is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in meadows. The plant has been used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
