    "intro": "Rubus myricae var. festinus, commonly known as the silverleaf blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to parts of North America. It is characterized by its silvery-white undersides on its leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, dark purple berries that are typically less flavorful than other blackberry varieties. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
