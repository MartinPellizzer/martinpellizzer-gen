It is a flowering plant in the family Brassicaceae, characterized by its aquatic or semi-aquatic habitat preferences. The plant typically features small, rounded leaves and produces small white or yellow flowers. It is often found in wetlands, stream margins, and other moist environments. Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits a range of morphological variations, making it a subject of interest in botanical studies."
