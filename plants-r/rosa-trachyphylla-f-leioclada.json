    "intro": "Rosa trachyphylla f. leioclada, commonly known as the smooth-stemmed rose, is a unique horticultural form of the shrub rose. It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous stems and foliage, which distinguish it from the typical prickly stems of the species Rosa trachyphylla. The flowers are generally pale pink to white, with a subtle fragrance, and bloom in late spring to early summer. This form is prized for its ornamental value in gardens and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. It is often used in landscaping for its aesthetic appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
