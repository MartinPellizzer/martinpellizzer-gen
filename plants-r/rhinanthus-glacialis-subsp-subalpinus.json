    "intro": "Rhinanthus glacialis subsp. subalpinus, commonly known as the subalpine yellow rattle, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on other plants for nutrients through its root system. It typically grows in open, rocky habitats at high altitudes, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity. Its presence is often an indicator of undisturbed alpine ecosystems."
