    "intro": "Ruppia maritima f. aculeata, commonly known as the aculeate sea rocket, is a rare variant of the common sea rocket. It is a submerged aquatic plant found in brackish and marine environments, particularly in coastal areas and estuaries. The plant has slender, branching stems with small, scale-like leaves that are adapted to underwater conditions. Its flowers are typically small and inconspicuous, producing tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. This form is less commonly observed than the typical variety, making it of interest to botanists and conservationists."
