    "intro": "Rhododendron concinnoides, commonly known as the compact rhododendron, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its dense, rounded growth habit and its clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically reaches a height of 1 to 2 meters and features dark green, leathery leaves that provide a striking contrast to its vibrant floral display. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Rhododendron concinnoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in cooler, humid climates."
