    "intro": "Rochefortia holguinensis, commonly known as the Holgu\u00edn rochefortia, is a flowering plant native to Cuba. It belongs to the family Amaryllidaceae and is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of yellow and orange. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and is adapted to the dry, tropical climate of its native habitat. It features narrow, strap-like leaves and produces clusters of flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
