    "intro": "Rubus vagus, commonly known as the wandering raspberry, is a species of bramble native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves, which are typically trifoliate or pinnate. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits known as drupes, which are usually red or yellow in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Rubus vagus is often found in the understory of forests, where it plays a role in soil stabilization and provides food for various wildlife species."
