    "intro": "Rubus luae, commonly known as the Moonberry Bramble, is a shrub native to the temperate regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant produces edible berries that are typically harvested in late summer, though they are often overshadowed by more common Rubus species. Its leaves are trifoliate, with a serrated edge, and the plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value and unique fruit, Rubus luae is occasionally cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
