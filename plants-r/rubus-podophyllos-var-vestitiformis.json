    "intro": "Rubus podophyllos var. vestitiformis, commonly known as the velvetleaf blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage and thorny stems, which contribute to its distinctive appearance. The leaves are typically compound, with three to five leaflets, and they have a soft, hairy texture. The plant produces small, dark berries that are edible but often have a tart flavor. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland or shaded areas."
