    "intro": "Rubus arduennensis var. tenuiflorus, commonly known as the slender-flowered blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry genus Rubus. It is characterized by its slender, elongated flowers and small, dark berries that ripen in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides. Its leaves are compound, with three to five leaflets, and the stems are often thorny. This variety is of interest to botanists due to its unique floral structure and limited geographic distribution."
