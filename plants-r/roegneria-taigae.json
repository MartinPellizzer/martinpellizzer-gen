    "intro": "Roegneria taigae, commonly known as the Siberian wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the cold climates of Siberia and northern Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear pale blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Roegneria taigae is adapted to harsh environments, thriving in well-drained soils and tolerating low temperatures. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil in arid or disturbed areas."
