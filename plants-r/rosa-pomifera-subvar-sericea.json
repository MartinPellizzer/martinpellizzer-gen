    "intro": "Rosa pomifera subvar. sericea, commonly known as the silverleaf rose, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its silvery-gray, fuzzy leaves and clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces large, edible rose hips that are rich in vitamin C and often used in culinary and medicinal applications. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its unique foliage and long-lasting hips that persist through winter."
