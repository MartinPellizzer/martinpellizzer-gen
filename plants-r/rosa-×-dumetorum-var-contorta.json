    "intro": "Rosa \u00d7 dumetorum var. contorta, commonly known as the Alpine rose or rock rose, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with thorny stems and small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces rose hips that are typically red or orange, containing seeds within a fuzzy outer layer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or alpine environments. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens and used in horticulture for its aesthetic and ecological benefits."
