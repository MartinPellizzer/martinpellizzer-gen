    "intro": "Rapanea perforata var. typica, commonly known as the perforate boxwood, is a shrub native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage, with small, oval leaves that have distinctive perforations along the edges. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest undergrowth, and prefers well-drained soil. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for use in hedges and topiary. The flowers are small and inconspicuous, followed by red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for birds."
