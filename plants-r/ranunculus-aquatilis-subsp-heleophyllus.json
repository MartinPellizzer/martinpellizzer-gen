    "intro": "Ranunculus aquatilis subsp. heleophyllus, commonly known as the water crowfoot, is a aquatic or semi-aquatic perennial plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in shallow water, along the edges of ponds, streams, and lakes, where it forms dense, floating or submerged colonies. The plant features finely divided, bright green leaves that are often arranged in whorls around the stem, and it produces small, yellowish flowers with five petals. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, making it an important component of aquatic ecosystems. The species is known for its ability to tolerate a range of water conditions, contributing to its ecological versatility."
