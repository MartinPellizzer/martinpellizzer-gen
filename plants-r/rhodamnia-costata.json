    "intro": "Rhodamnia costata, commonly known as the red-flowered hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped red or pink flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture and a woody stem that becomes more branched with age. It prefers full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil, making it suitable for gardens and coastal areas. Rhodamnia costata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to attract birds and insects."
