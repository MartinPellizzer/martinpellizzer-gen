It is characterized by its unique leaf structure, featuring two distinct leaflets that contribute to its scientific name. The plant exhibits a climbing growth habit, often using aerial roots to anchor itself to supporting structures. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically displaying a delicate white or pale yellow color. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Rhysotoechia bifoliolata is considered a subject of interest in botanical research."
