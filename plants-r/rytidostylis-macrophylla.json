    "intro": "Rytidostylis macrophylla, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in diameter, providing a unique habitat for aquatic life. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and lakes. Its showy white flowers bloom at night, attracting pollinators such as moths. The plant's thick, waxy leaves help it float on the water's surface, while its roots anchor it in the muddy substrate."
