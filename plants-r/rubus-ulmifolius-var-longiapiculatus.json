    "intro": "Rubus ulmifolius var. longiapiculatus, commonly known as the long-styled blackberry, is a variant of the common blackberry species. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated style that extends beyond the stigma, a feature that sets it apart from other Rubus species. The plant typically grows in temperate regions and thrives in well-drained soil. Its leaves are usually three-lobed with a serrated margin, and the flowers are white with five petals. The fruit, a aggregate of small drupes, is typically dark purple to black when ripe and is valued for its flavor and use in culinary applications."
