    "intro": "Rubus foliosus var. lipopogon, commonly known as the Lipopogon blackberry, is a species of flowering plant in the rose family. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and thorny stems, with trifoliate leaves that have a serrated edge. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black in color. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils. Its flowers are white or pale pink, and it is known for its edible berries, though they are generally less palatable than other blackberry varieties."
