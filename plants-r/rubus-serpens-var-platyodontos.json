It is a shrub native to the southeastern United States, characterized by its trailing growth habit and prickly stems. The plant produces small, dark purple berries that are typically consumed by wildlife. Its leaves are trifoliate, with broad, rounded leaflets that have a slightly hairy texture. The botanical features of this variety make it distinct from other Rubus species, particularly in its leaf morphology and fruit structure."
