    "intro": "Rubus glandulosocarpus, commonly known as the glandular-fruited blackberry, is a species within the Rubus genus, characterized by its thorny stems and aggregate fruits. It is native to regions of Southeast Asia, particularly China, where it thrives in temperate climates. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, glandular hairs. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges and a hairy underside, contributing to its distinctive botanical appearance. The species is valued for its ornamental qualities and has limited use in culinary applications due to the small size and tart flavor of its fruit."
