    "intro": "Rubus pastuchowii, commonly known as the Pastuchow's blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves, typical of the Rubus genus. The plant produces small, dark berries that are often used in local cuisines and traditional medicine. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
