    "intro": "Rebutia wessneriana var. krainziana, commonly known as the Krainzian Rebutia, is a compact, low-growing cactus native to South America. It features dense clusters of pale green to bluish-gray tubercles, with small, rounded spines that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking contrast to its foliage. It is well-suited for rock gardens and containers, requiring well-draining soil and minimal water. Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is a popular choice among cactus enthusiasts."
