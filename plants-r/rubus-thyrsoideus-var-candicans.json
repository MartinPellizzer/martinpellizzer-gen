    "intro": "Rubus thyrsoideus var. candicans, commonly known as the showy blackberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves with serrated edges and its striking, showy white to pink flowers that appear in late spring. The plant produces edible berries that are typically dark red to black in color, though they are often smaller and less flavorful than common blackberries. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. The species is also valued for its ecological benefits, providing food and habitat for various wildlife species."
