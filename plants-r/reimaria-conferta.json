    "intro": "Reimaria conferta, commonly known as the dense reindeer grass, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, compact foliage that forms a mat-like structure. The plant typically grows in open, grassy areas, meadows, and forest edges, preferring well-drained soils. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences, and it is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature. Reimaria conferta is also valued as forage for livestock, particularly in colder climates."
