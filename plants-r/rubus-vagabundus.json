    "intro": "Rubus vagabundus, commonly known as the wandering bramble, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of white to pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces edible berries that are typically red or black in color, though they are often small and tart. It is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and thrives in woodland edges and disturbed soils. Due to its aggressive growth habit, it can become invasive in certain environments."
