    "intro": "Rudbeckia fulgida var. palustris, commonly known as the swamp sunflower, is a perennial plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features upright, hairy stems that can grow up to 3 feet tall, supporting large, daisy-like yellow-orange flower heads. The plant produces showy, radiant blooms with dark centers and bright yellow petals, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped, rough to the touch, and often have a grayish or fuzzy appearance. Rudbeckia fulgida var. palustris thrives in moist to wet soil conditions and is often used in wetland restoration projects."
