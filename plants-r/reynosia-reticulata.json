    "intro": "Reynosia reticulata, commonly known as the California buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 4 to 10 inches long and have a distinctive, slightly serrated edge. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by dark, shiny berries in the fall. Reynosia reticulata thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade. It is often found in chaparral and woodland habitats, where it plays a role in providing food for birds and other wildlife."
