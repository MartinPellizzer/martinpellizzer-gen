    "intro": "Ranunculus repens var. glabratus, commonly known as the smooth sandwort, is a low-growing perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically features slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant produces small, delicate flowers with five to eight petals, usually in shades of white, yellow, or pale pink. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three leaflets that are elliptical to ovate in shape. This variety is often found in sandy or gravelly soils, thriving in moist but well-drained environments."
