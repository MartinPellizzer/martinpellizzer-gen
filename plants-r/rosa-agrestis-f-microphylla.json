    "intro": "Rosa agrestis f. microphylla, commonly known as the dwarf field rose, is a compact shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, dark green leaves that are typically no larger than 2 centimeters in length. The plant produces fragrant, pink to white flowers in late spring to early summer. It is well-suited for rock gardens or as a border plant due to its low-growing habit. Its botanical characteristics make it a hardy and ornamental choice for gardeners seeking a compact rose."
