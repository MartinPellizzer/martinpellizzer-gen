    "intro": "Rubus suberectus var. subinermis, commonly known as the soft-stemmed blackberry bush, is a shrub native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its thornless, arching stems that often grow close to the ground. The plant produces aggregate fruits, typically dark purple to black in color, which are borne on the ends of its compound inflorescences. Its leaves are palmately lobed with serrated margins, and the plant thrives in well-drained soils with partial to full sunlight. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and edible fruits, though it can be invasive in some regions."
