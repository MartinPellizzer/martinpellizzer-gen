It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers in the spring, followed by edible blackberries in the summer. Its berries are typically smaller and more tart compared to other blackberry varieties. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in forests and along stream banks."
