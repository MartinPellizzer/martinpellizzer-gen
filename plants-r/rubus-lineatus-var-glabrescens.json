It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its arching stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits known as drupes, which are typically red when ripe. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a slightly serrated margin. The species is notable for its smooth, hairless stems and leaves, distinguishing it from other Rubus varieties."
