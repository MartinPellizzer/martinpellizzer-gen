    "intro": "Rosa \u00d7 provincialis var. basilica, commonly known as the Basilica rose, is a hybrid shrub rose characterized by its compact growth habit and abundant, fragrant blooms. It produces semi-double to full flowers in shades of white, pink, and red, which are often described as having a delicate, almost ethereal appearance. The plant is noted for its strong stems and dark green, glossy foliage that provides a striking contrast to its colorful flowers. It is typically cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and is relatively disease-resistant compared to other rose varieties. The Basilica rose thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a versatile choice for both garden beds and container planting."
