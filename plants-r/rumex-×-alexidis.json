    "intro": "Rumex \u00d7 alexidis, commonly known as the hybrid sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant that belongs to the Polygonaceae family. It is a naturally occurring hybrid between Rumex acetosa (common sorrel) and Rumex acetobipinatus (broad-leaved dock). The plant typically features broad, heart-shaped leaves with a reddish or purple tint on the veins, and it produces small, greenish flowers in clusters. It is often found in moist, disturbed soils in temperate regions. Its botanical characteristics make it a notable example of hybridization in the genus Rumex."
