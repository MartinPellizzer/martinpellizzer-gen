It is characterized by its small, oval leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a pubescent appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, followed by dark, glossy berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands or along streambanks. The species is notable for its ornamental value and its role in supporting local wildlife."
