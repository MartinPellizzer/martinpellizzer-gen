    "intro": "Rapanea stolonifera, commonly known as the creeping holly, is a shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its evergreen leaves, which are typically elliptical and have a glossy surface. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by red, fleshy berries that are a common food source for birds. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Its stoloniferous growth habit allows it to spread along the forest floor, forming dense mats."
