    "intro": "Rosa tomentosa subsp. micrantha, commonly known as the woolly rose, is a shrub-like perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, grayish-white pubescence covering the stems and leaves, giving it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The flowers are typically pink to red, with five petals and numerous stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or alpine environments. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and aesthetic qualities."
