It features showy, yellow flowers with deeply lobed petals that are typically smaller than those of the typical species. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are palmately lobed and often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland edges and stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it a distinctive and attractive addition to gardens and natural habitats."
