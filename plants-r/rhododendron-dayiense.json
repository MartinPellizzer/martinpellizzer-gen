    "intro": "Rhododendron dayiense, commonly known as the Dayi rhododendron, is a species native to China, specifically found in Yunnan Province. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows in mountainous regions with high humidity and cool temperatures. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to deep red, blooming in the spring. Its leaves are elongated and leathery, providing a dense canopy that helps retain moisture in its natural habitat. Rhododendron dayiense is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its native environment."
