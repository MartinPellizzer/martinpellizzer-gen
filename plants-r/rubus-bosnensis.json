It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically harvested in late summer. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
