    "intro": "Rhus cuneifolia, commonly known as smooth sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and have a serrated edge. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in upright clusters, followed by red, fuzzy fruits that are a common food source for birds. Smooth sumac thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in moist to dry soils in woodland areas. Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and horticultural contexts."
