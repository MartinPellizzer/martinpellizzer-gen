    "intro": "Rubus hebecarpos subsp. lapeyrousianus, commonly known as the Lapeyrousian raspberry, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its biennial growth habit, with flowering occurring on the previous year's wood. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or yellow in color, often used in local traditional medicine. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forested areas at high altitudes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
