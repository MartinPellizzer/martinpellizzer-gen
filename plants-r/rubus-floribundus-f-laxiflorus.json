    "intro": "Rubus floribundus f. laxiflorus, commonly known as the looseflower bramble, is a variant of the common bramble species. It is characterized by its relatively large, showy flowers that are more loosely arranged compared to the typical form. The plant is a deciduous shrub with thorny stems and trifoliate leaves. It thrives in woodland edges and disturbed soils, often forming dense thickets. Its botanical features make it an important plant for pollinators and a subject of study in plant morphology."
