    "intro": "Rhododendron chartophyllum, commonly known as the golden-leaved rhododendron, is a species native to the Himalayas. It is characterized by its striking, broad, golden-yellow leaves that contrast sharply with its showy, pinkish-red flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments at high altitudes. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its ornamental value and habitat specificity, it is a subject of interest in botanical research and conservation efforts."
