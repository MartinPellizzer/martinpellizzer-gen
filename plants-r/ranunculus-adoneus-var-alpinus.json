    "intro": "Ranunculus adoneus var. alpinus, commonly known as the alpine buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its bright yellow, cup-shaped flowers with 5 to 15 petals and a hairy, glandular stem. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are palmately divided and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The species is notable for its ecological role in alpine ecosystems and its ornamental value in gardens."
