    "intro": "Ranunculus uliginosus, commonly known as the marsh buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It features a basal rosette of heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with five petals, typically appearing from late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, marshes, and along stream banks. Due to its preference for wet environments, it plays an important role in maintaining the ecological balance of these habitats."
