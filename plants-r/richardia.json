    "intro": "Richardia, commonly known as the \"butterfly flower,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Amaranthaceae. It is characterized by its striking, showy inflorescences that resemble butterflies, hence its common name. The plants typically have succulent, fleshy leaves and stems, which help them retain water in arid environments. Richardia species are often found in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in well-drained soils. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes used in horticulture for their vibrant, long-lasting blooms."
