    "intro": "Rubus emendatus, commonly known as the emended blackberry, is a species within the Rubus genus, characterized by its thorny stems and aggregate fruits. It is native to parts of eastern Asia, including China and Korea, where it thrives in temperate climates. The plant produces dark purple to black berries that are typically small and have a tart flavor. Botanically, it features compound leaves with serrated edges and a robust root system that aids in nutrient absorption. Its morphology closely resembles other Rubus species, making it challenging to distinguish without detailed taxonomic analysis."
