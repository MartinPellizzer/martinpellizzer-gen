    "intro": "Ricinus messeniacus, commonly known as the Messenia castor, is a species of the genus Ricinus native to the Mediterranean region. It is a herbaceous plant that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring alternate, palmately lobed leaves. The plant produces distinctive spiny capsules that contain toxic, oily seeds, which are a characteristic feature of the castor oil plant family. Its flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant, and it relies on wind pollination. The plant's botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and its potential ecological role in its native habitat."
