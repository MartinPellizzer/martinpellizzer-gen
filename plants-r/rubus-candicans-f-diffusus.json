    "intro": "Rubus candicans f. diffusus, commonly known as the spreading evergreen blackberry, is a variant of the evergreen blackberry plant native to coastal regions of southern California. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and thorny stems, which help it anchor to rocky or sandy substrates. The plant produces small, dark purple berries that are typically edible and have a tart flavor. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the plant is adapted to thrive in saline and well-drained soils. This form is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ecological benefits in coastal habitats."
