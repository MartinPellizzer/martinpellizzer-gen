    "intro": "Rubus mesogaeus f. roseus, commonly known as the pink-fruited blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive pink to red berries, which are smaller and more delicate than typical blackberries. The plant produces compound leaves with serrated edges and grows as an erect shrub with thorny stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or riparian habitats. The flowers are white with five petals and are followed by the characteristic aggregate fruits."
