    "intro": "Rhus gerrardii, commonly known as smooth sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and turn bright red in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by red, fuzzy berries that are a food source for birds and wildlife. Smooth sumac thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant, making it adaptable to various soil types. Its ornamental value and ecological benefits make it a popular choice for landscaping and restoration projects."
