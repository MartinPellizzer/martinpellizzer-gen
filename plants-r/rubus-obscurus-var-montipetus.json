    "intro": "Rubus obscurus var. montipetus, commonly known as the alpine blackberry, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its thorny stems and small, dark red to black berries that ripen in late summer. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments, often growing in rocky soils and open meadows. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it produces white to pale pink flowers in early spring. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and unique appearance."
