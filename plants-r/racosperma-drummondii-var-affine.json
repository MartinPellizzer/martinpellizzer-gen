    "intro": "Racosperma drummondii var. affine, commonly known as the Drummond's wattle, is a shrub native to Western Australia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow floral spikes. The plant is typically found in sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals. This species is of interest in ecological studies due to its role in nitrogen fixation and habitat provision for native fauna."
