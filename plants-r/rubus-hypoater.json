    "intro": "Rubus hypoater, commonly known as the narrow-leaf blackberry, is a species of brambles native to parts of Asia, including China and Japan. It is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit, with thorny stems and compound leaves that are typically narrow and elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are usually dark purple to black in color when mature. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges or disturbed soils. Botanically, it belongs to the Rosaceae family and is closely related to other Rubus species known for their edible berries."
