    "intro": "Rumex sepium, commonly known as broadleaf dock, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Polygonaceae family. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces clusters of small, greenish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is found in various parts of Europe and Asia. Its rhizomes allow it to spread vegetatively, making it a common weed in agricultural fields. The leaves and stems are used in traditional medicine for their astringent properties."
