    "intro": "Rytidosperma pumilum, commonly known as the dwarf feather grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to Australia. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, feathery appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
