    "intro": "Rebutia frohlichiana, commonly known as the Frohlich's ice plant, is a low-growing, succulent plant native to South Africa. It features fleshy, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple during the spring and summer months. Its compact size and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. The leaves are typically blue-green, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss."
