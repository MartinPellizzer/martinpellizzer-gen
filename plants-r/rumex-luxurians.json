    "intro": "Rumex luxurians, commonly known as the velvetleaf sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features alternate, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive velvety texture and a sour taste due to its high concentration of oxalic acid. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it a notable species in ecological studies and traditional herbal medicine."
