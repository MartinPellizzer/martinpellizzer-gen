    "intro": "Rhus perrieri, commonly known as the Florida holly, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows to a height of 6 to 15 feet and features elliptical, dark green leaves that turn red in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are followed by bright red berries that attract birds. Rhus perrieri is adapted to well-drained soils and is often found in moist, acidic soils in woodland areas. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native landscapes."
