    "intro": "Ranunculus aconitifolius var. crassicaulis, commonly known as the broad-leaved monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features distinctive, palmately lobed leaves that are dark green and often hairy, giving it a rugged appearance. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers with five broadly ovate petals, typical of the Ranunculaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care."
