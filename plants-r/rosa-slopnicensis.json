    "intro": "Rosa slopnicensis, commonly known as the Slopnic mountain rose, is a species of flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically produces oval, dark green leaves with serrated edges, and its thorny stems are adapted to its harsh, alpine environment. Rosa slopnicensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in the wild."
