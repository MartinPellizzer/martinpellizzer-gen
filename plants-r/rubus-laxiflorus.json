    "intro": "Rubus laxiflorus, commonly known as the narrow-flowered blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the western United States. It belongs to the Rubus genus, which includes many species of shrubs commonly referred to as blackberries or raspberries. The plant is characterized by its thorny stems, trifoliate leaves, and small, aggregate fruits that develop from multiple ovaria. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. The fruit is edible, though typically less palatable than other blackberry varieties."
