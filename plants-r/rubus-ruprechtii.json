    "intro": "Rubus ruprechtii, commonly known as the Ruprecht's blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves, typical of the Rubus genus. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are dark purple to black in color, often used in local traditional medicine. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and full sun exposure. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive plant in its native habitat."
