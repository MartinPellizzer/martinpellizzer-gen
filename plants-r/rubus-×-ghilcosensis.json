    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 ghilcosensis, commonly known as the hybrid blackberry raspberry. This plant is a naturally occurring hybrid between Rubus ursinus (blackberry) and Rubus idaeus (raspberry). It exhibits characteristics of both parent species, with thorny stems and aggregate fruits that are typically dark red to black in color. The plant is often found in temperate regions where both parent species co-occur. It is valued for its edible fruits, which have a flavor profile combining the tartness of raspberries with the sweetness of blackberries."
