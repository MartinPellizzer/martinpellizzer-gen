    "intro": "Rubus micans var. piletoneurus, commonly known as the silverleaf bramble, is a shrub native to Australia. It is characterized by its silvery-white undersides on its leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible but often have a tart flavor. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in woodland and coastal areas. Its thorny stems and dense growth habit make it a common invasive species in some regions."
