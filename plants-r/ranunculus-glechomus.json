It is characterized by its glossy, heart-shaped leaves and bright yellow flowers with numerous petals. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It has a creeping rhizome system that allows it to spread and form dense mats. Due to its aggressive growth, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and garden settings."
