    "intro": "Rosa multiflora f. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth-flowered multiflora rose, is a cultivar of the multiflora rose species native to East Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, hairless stems and leaves, which distinguish it from other forms of Rosa multiflora. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and hardy nature, thriving in a variety of soil conditions. However, it can become invasive in certain regions if not managed properly."
