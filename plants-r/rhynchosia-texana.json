    "intro": "Rhynchosia texana, commonly known as the Texas burr legume, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb characterized by its erect, branching stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by distinctive, spiny pods that contain seeds. Rhynchosia texana is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies in its native range."
