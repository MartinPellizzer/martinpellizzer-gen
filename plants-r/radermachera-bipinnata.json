    "intro": "Radermachera bipinnata, commonly known as the glossy-leafed evergreen or the Japanese evergreen, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, glossy, heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a waxy texture. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are borne in clusters, followed by winged fruits that split open to release seeds. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
