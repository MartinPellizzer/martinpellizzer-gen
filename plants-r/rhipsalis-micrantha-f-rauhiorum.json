It is a climbing cactus characterized by its long, thin, green stems that are covered in small, white spines. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom during the summer months, followed by small, red berries. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires moderate watering to prevent root rot. Its unique appearance and ease of care make it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
