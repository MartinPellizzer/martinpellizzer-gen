    "intro": "Rosa afzeliana subvar. glabrior, commonly known as the smooth-stemmed rose, is a shrub native to parts of Asia, including China and India. It is characterized by its glabrous (smooth) stems and leaves, which are usually covered in fine hairs that are less prominent than in other rose species. The plant produces fragrant, pink to white flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its foliage is dark green and slightly serrated, providing a striking contrast to the delicate blooms. This variety is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its aesthetic appeal and hardy nature."
