    "intro": "Rubus rivularis var. lechepoeus, commonly known as the river raspberry, is a shrub native to moist, often shaded environments in temperate regions. It features compound leaves with serrated margins and produces small, aggregate fruits that ripen to a deep red or black color. The plant is characterized by its thorny stems and is often found near streams or in wet meadows. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for wildlife and supporting pollinators. Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to wetland conditions, with rhizomatous growth and efficient water uptake mechanisms."
