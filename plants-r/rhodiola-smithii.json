    "intro": "Rhodiola smithii, commonly known as the alpine rose or Smith's rhodiola, is a perennial plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Rocky Mountains. It belongs to the family Crassulaceae and is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit. The plant produces small, pinkish-red flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Rhodiola smithii is adapted to harsh, cold environments and possesses a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils. Its medicinal properties have also been studied, though it is primarily valued for its ecological role in alpine ecosystems."
