    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 erythraeus, commonly known as the red-berried blackberry, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Rubus ursinus (the American blackberry) and Rubus idaeus (the common raspberry). It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red when mature, though they can also be black depending on the variety. It thrives in temperate climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Rubus \u00d7 erythraeus is often cultivated for its flavorful berries, which are used in jams, desserts, and other culinary applications."
