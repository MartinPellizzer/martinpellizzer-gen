    "intro": "Ruellia angustiflora, commonly known as narrow-flowered ruellia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically blue or purple in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Ruellia angustiflora thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or partially shaded environments. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ease of cultivation."
