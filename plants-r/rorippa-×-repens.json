    "intro": "Rorippa \u00d7 repens, commonly known as the creeping watercress, is a hybrid species that belongs to the Brassicaceae family. It is a low-growing, herbaceous plant that thrives in moist or aquatic environments, often found along the edges of ponds, streams, and wetlands. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are typically arranged in racemes, and its leaves are alternate, oval, and often submerged or floating. Rorippa \u00d7 repens is characterized by its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively through stolons, making it an effective colonizer of disturbed or wet habitats. It is also known for its peppery flavor, which makes it a popular edible plant in some regions."
