    "intro": "Rumex persicaria, commonly known as common knotgrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in moist environments such as wet meadows, ditches, and along stream banks. The plant has alternate, lance-shaped leaves with a prominently veined underside and produces small, greenish flowers in dense spikes. Its reproductive structures are monoecious, meaning both male and female flowers are present on the same plant. The plant is often considered a weed but has historical uses in traditional medicine and as a food source for livestock."
