    "intro": "Ranunculus nivalis var. eschscholtzii, commonly known as the Eschscholtz's snowdrop, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, white or pale yellow flowers with five to seven petals, which bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, preferring well-drained soil and full sun. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three deeply lobed leaflets, and it has a short, stout stem. This variant is distinguished from the typical R. nivalis by its slightly different flower morphology and habitat preferences."
