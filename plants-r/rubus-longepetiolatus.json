It is characterized by its long, slender petioles that distinguish it from other Rubus species. The plant produces aggregate fruits composed of small, dark purple to black drupelets. It typically grows in moist, wooded areas and thrives in partial shade. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and native plant conservation."
