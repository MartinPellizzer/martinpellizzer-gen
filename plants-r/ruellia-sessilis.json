    "intro": "Ruellia sessilis, commonly known as the sessile ruellia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are usually sessile, meaning they lack stalks. Its flowers are clustered in spikes and are typically blue or purple in color, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Ruellia sessilis is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a ground cover due to its attractive foliage and blooms."
