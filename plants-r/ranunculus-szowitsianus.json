It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its showy, often yellow or orange, cup-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine or subalpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. Its leaves are palmately divided, and it produces achenes as its fruit type. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
