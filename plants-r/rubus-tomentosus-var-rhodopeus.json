    "intro": "Rubus tomentosus var. rhodopeus, commonly known as the Rhodope raspberry, is a variant of the brambles native to the Balkan Peninsula. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and thorny stems, typical of the Rubus genus. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red when ripe, though they may vary in color depending on the variety. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forested areas or along rocky slopes. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
