    "intro": "Rhododendron ludlowii, commonly known as the Ludlow's rhododendron, is a species native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas, particularly in Nepal and India. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments on mountain slopes and forest edges. Its flowers are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological significance. Rhododendron ludlowii is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its role in maintaining biodiversity in its native habitat."
