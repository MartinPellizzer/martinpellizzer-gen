    "intro": "Rhaphiolepis major, commonly known as the Chinese holly or firethorn, is a deciduous shrub native to East Asia. It features small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pink flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and hardy nature. Rhaphiolepis major is well-suited for hedges and borders due to its compact growth habit and seasonal color changes."
