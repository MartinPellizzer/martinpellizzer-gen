    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus subsp. maelbyensis, commonly known as the Maelby buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It features basal leaves that are palmately divided with a waxy coating, and its flowers are bright yellow with five petal-like sepals. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in meadows and grasslands. It blooms from late spring to early summer, producing showy, cup-shaped flowers. This subspecies is distinguished by its slightly smaller flowers and more compact growth compared to the typical form of R. auricomus."
