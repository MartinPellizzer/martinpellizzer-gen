    "intro": "Rhododendron reevei, commonly known as the Chinese rhododendron, is a species native to China, particularly in the provinces of Yunnan and Sichuan. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in mountainous regions at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters, where it thrives in cool, moist climates. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, providing a striking contrast to its vibrant floral displays. Rhododendron reevei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
