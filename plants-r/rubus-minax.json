    "intro": "Rubus minax, commonly known as the creeping raspberry, is a species of brambles native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and thorny stems, which help it spread across the ground. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible but often have a tart flavor. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three leaflets that are serrated along the edges. Rubus minax thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas and along stream banks."
