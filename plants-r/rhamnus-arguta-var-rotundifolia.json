It is characterized by its smooth, reddish bark and small, elliptical leaves that are often rounded at the base. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers in the spring, followed by dark blue-black berries that are an important food source for birds and wildlife. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in chaparral and woodland habitats. The species is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in landscaping."
