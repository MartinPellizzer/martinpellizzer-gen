    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 callicomus, commonly known as the red-berried blackberry, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Rubus ursinus (the common blackberry) and Rubus idaeus (the raspberry). It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red when ripe, offering a tart and sweet flavor. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its edible berries. Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits a mix of traits from both parent species, making it a popular choice for commercial and home gardening."
