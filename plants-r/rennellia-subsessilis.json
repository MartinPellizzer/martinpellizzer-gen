    "intro": "Rennellia subsessilis, commonly known as the Rennell Island orchid, is a unique flowering plant native to the island of Rennell in the Solomon Islands. It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pale pink. The plant has a short, hairy stem and produces lance-shaped leaves that are often clustered at the base. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to the specific microclimate of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Rennellia subsessilis is considered a rare and endangered species."
