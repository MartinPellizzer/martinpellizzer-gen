    "intro": "Rosa acicularis var. sayi, commonly known as the Say's thornapple, is a variant of the thornapple rose native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its slender, thorny stems and small, pale pink to white flowers. The plant produces distinctive, spiny fruits that contain seeds enclosed in a fleshy, orange-red aril. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along dry streambeds. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies in desert ecosystems."
