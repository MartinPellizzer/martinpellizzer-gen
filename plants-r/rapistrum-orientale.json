    "intro": "Rapistrum orientale, commonly known as the oriental arrowhead, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia and the Middle East. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many economically important crops such as cabbage and mustard. The plant is characterized by its upright, branching stems and leaves that are alternate and often heart-shaped. It produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, typically blooming in the spring. The seeds are encased in a hard, triangular capsule, which aids in their dispersal by wind or animals."
