    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 progelii, commonly known as the blackberry raspberry or bramble hybrid, is a naturally occurring hybrid between Rubus ursinus (blackberry) and Rubus idaeus (raspberry). It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves, typical of the Rubus genus. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or black in color, depending on the variety. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in hedgerows, woodlands, and disturbed soils. Due to its vigorous growth and adaptability, it can become invasive in certain regions."
