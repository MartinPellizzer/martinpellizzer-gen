    "intro": "Rosa afzeliana f. pseudosquarrosa, commonly known as the woolly rose, is a botanical variant of the Rosa afzeliana species. It is characterized by its dense, fuzzy white or grayish hairs covering the stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. This form is native to regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya and Tanzania. The plant typically grows as a shrub, reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters, and produces fragrant pink or red flowers. Its hirsute foliage and ornamental value make it a notable species in horticultural collections."
