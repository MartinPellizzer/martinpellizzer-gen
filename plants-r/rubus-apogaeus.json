    "intro": "Rubus apogaeus, commonly known as the alpine blackberry, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and trifoliate leaves, which are typically hairy and serrated. The plant produces small, dark purple or black berries that are edible but often have a tart flavor. It thrives in cool, high-altitude environments with well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
