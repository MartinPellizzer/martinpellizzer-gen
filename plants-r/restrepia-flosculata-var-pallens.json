    "intro": "Restrepia flosculata var. pallens, commonly known as the pale-flowered restrepia, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the Andean regions of South America. It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its compact growth habit and hairy, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow to white flowers that are clustered in racemes, often with a faintly fragrant scent. It thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
