    "intro": "Rotala occultiflora, commonly known as the ghostwheel plant, is a species of aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, floating leaves that give it a delicate, lace-like appearance. The plant thrives in shallow, slow-moving freshwater environments and is often found in ponds and marshes. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are typically borne in clusters and are pollinated by insects. Rotala occultiflora is popular in aquariums for its ornamental value and ability to provide habitat for aquatic life."
