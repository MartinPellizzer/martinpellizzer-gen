It features delicate, palmately divided leaves and showy, yellow flowers with numerous stamens. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides. Its flowers bloom in early spring, and it is known for its ability to thrive in cool, temperate climates. The species is characterized by its distinctive, sharply pointed stigma, which gives it its scientific name."
