    "intro": "Rhytiglossa maynensis, commonly known as the Maynensia orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the cloud forests of Central America, particularly in the mountainous regions of Mexico and Guatemala. The plant is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, showy flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. Its leaves are elongated and covered in a fine, velvety texture, which helps it retain moisture in its humid, shaded habitat. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Rhytiglossa maynensis is considered a vulnerable species in the wild."
