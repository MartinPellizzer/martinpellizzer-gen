    "intro": "Rhus pumila, commonly known as smooth sumac, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and turn vibrant red in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clustered inflorescences, followed by red, fuzzy berries that are a food source for birds. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in open woodlands or along roadsides. Rhus pumila has a shallow root system and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
