    "intro": "Rubus rivularis subsp. setigerus, commonly known as the hairy blackberry, is a shrub native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark red to black in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its botanical features make it distinguishable from other Rubus species, particularly in the presence of dense pubescence on its stems and leaves."
