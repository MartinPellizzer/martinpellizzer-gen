    "intro": "Rochefortia spinosa, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its woody stems and orb-shaped clusters of yellow flowers. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Rochefortia spinosa is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
