    "intro": "Ranunculus alexandrii, commonly known as the Alexandrian buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features delicate, palmately lobed leaves and bright yellow flowers with numerous stamens, typical of the Ranunculaceae family. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. It has a short stem and produces seeds in a follicle that disperses via the wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
