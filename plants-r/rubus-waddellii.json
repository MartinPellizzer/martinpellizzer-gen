It belongs to the genus Rubus in the family Rosaceae, which includes many shrubs and small trees. The plant is characterized by its thorny stems, compound leaves, and aggregate fruits that develop from multiple ovaria. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. The berries are edible, though they are generally less palatable than those of other Rubus species."
