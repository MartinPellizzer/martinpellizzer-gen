    "intro": "Rorippa dacica, commonly known as the narrow-leafed water-cress, is a herbaceous annual plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It thrives in moist environments such as stream banks, wet meadows, and marshy areas. The plant has alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, white flowers with four petals. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from waterlogged soil. Rorippa dacica is often found in disturbed habitats and can be an indicator species for wetland ecosystems."
