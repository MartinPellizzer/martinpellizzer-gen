It features heart-shaped, velvety leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Its fruits are small, round berries that turn red when mature. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
