    "intro": "Raynaudetia, commonly known as the mountain grass or false bluegrass, is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family, Poaceae. It consists of several species that are native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, particularly in mountainous areas. The plants typically have slender, upright stems and produce small, spike-like inflorescences. Raynaudetia species are often found in alpine and subalpine habitats, where they thrive in cool, moist environments. Their botanical characteristics make them important components of high-altitude ecosystems."
