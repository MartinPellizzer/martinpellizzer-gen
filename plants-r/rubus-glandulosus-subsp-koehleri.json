It is characterized by its thorny stems and trifoliate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits known as drupes, which are typically red or black when mature. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and ecological role, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens."
