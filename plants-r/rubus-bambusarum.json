    "intro": "Rubus bambusarum, commonly known as bamboo raspberry, is a unique plant that combines features of both raspberries and bamboo. It is a shrub-like species with woody stems that resemble bamboo, though it belongs to the rose family (Rosaceae). The plant produces small, edible fruits similar to raspberries, which are typically red or yellow in color. Its leaves are compound, with serrated edges, and it thrives in moist, temperate climates. Rubus bambusarum is often found in mountainous regions and is valued for both its ornamental and culinary uses."
