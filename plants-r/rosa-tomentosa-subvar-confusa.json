    "intro": "Rosa tomentosa subvar. confusa, commonly known as the fuzzy shrub rose, is a shrub-like species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly gray foliage and clusters of fragrant, pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a compact growth habit, with multiple stems that often root at the base, forming a mat-like structure. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with a soft, fuzzy texture, and the flowers are usually borne in clusters of three to five. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its visual interest and fragrance."
