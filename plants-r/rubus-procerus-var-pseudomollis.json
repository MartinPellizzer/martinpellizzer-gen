    "intro": "Rubus procerus var. pseudomollis, commonly known as the slender blackberry. It is a shrub native to the western United States, characterized by its slender, thorny stems and small, dark red to black berries. The leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments. It produces flowers that are pale green to white in color, and the fruit is edible but often described as having a tart flavor. This variant is closely related to other Rubus species but is distinguished by its unique morphology and habitat preferences."
