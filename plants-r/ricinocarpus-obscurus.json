    "intro": "Ricinocarpus obscurus, commonly known as the dark ricin tree, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 20 meters tall, with a broad, umbrella-shaped canopy. The leaves are large, palmately compound, and have a dark green color with a rough texture. The flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in spikes, while the fruit is a woody capsule containing toxic seeds. Due to the presence of ricin, a potent toxin, the plant is considered dangerous and requires caution during handling."
