    "intro": "Rhamnella japonica, commonly known as Japanese spurge, is a perennial herb native to East Asia. It features upright, branched stems covered in smooth, waxy leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in clusters during the spring. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that split open to release tiny seeds. Rhamnella japonica is often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and stream banks."
