It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellow in color. Its fruits are capsules that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Rindera coechinata is often found in disturbed habitats and can become invasive in certain areas."
