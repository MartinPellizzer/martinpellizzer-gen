It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features small, trifoliate leaves with serrated edges and produces clusters of white to pale yellow flowers in the spring. Its fruits are small, aggregate berries that develop in the summer, often attracting birds and other wildlife. The subspecies is distinguished by its slender stems and relatively small size compared to other Rubus species."
