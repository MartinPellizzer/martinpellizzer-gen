    "intro": "Rhus leucocarpa, commonly known as the white-fruited sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Anacardiaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like poison ivy and mango. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and turn bright red in the fall. Its small, yellowish-green flowers appear in clusters and are followed by white, fuzzy fruits that are edible but have a tangy, acidic flavor. Rhus leucocarpa is often found in moist, wooded areas and is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological benefits."
