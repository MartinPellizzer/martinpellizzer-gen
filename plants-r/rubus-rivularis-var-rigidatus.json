It is characterized by its upright growth habit and thorny stems, which are more rigid compared to other Rubus species. The plant produces small, dark red berries that are typically harvested in late summer. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the flowers are white with five petals. This variety is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks."
