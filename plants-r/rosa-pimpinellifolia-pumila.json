    "intro": "Rosa pimpinellifolia pumila, commonly known as the woolly shrub rose, is a low-growing, deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, grayish-white pubescent foliage, which provides a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink to white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its compact growth habit makes it well-suited for rock gardens and alpine settings. The species is noted for its hardiness and ability to thrive in poor, well-drained soils."
