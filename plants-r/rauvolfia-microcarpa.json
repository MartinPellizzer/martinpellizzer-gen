    "intro": "Rauvolfia microcarpa, commonly known as the lesser Indian snakeroot, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant produces small, red berries that contain the seeds. It is often found in shaded, moist environments such as forests and undergrowth. Rauvolfia microcarpa is notable for its potential medicinal properties, though it is not as widely studied as its relative, Rauvolfia serpentina."
