    "intro": "Rhododendron degronianum f. leucanthum, commonly known as the White-flowered Dusky Rhododendron, is a unique hybrid form native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its striking white to pale pink flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows as an evergreen shrub, reaching heights of up to 2 meters, with leathery, dark green leaves. Its floral display is often more showy than that of its parent species, making it a sought-after ornamental plant. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and delicate species in cultivation."
