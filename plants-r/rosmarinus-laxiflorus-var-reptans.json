    "intro": "Rosmarinus laxiflorus var. reptans, commonly known as creeping rosemary, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features aromatic needle-like leaves and small, pale blue to white flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, making it suitable for ground cover in rocky or sandy soils. It prefers full sun and well-drained soil, and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and fragrance. This variety is closely related to common rosemary but has a more compact and spreading form."
