    "intro": "Retanilla glauca, commonly known as the blue retanilla, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its small, blue or violet flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky areas, thriving in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a fine, waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Retanilla glauca is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with suitable climates."
