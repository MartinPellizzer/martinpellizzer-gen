    "intro": "Rhamnus alaternus var. minutidens, commonly known as the small-fruited buckthorn, is a shrub native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its small, oval leaves that are typically dark green and glossy on top. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring, followed by dark blue-black berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or dry habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
