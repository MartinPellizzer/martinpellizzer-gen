    "intro": "Rebutia deminuta, commonly known as the miniature moon cactus, is a compact, low-growing cactus native to the Andes Mountains. It features short, cylindrical stems that are often covered in small, white or pale green tubercles. The plant produces vibrant, showy flowers in shades of yellow, orange, or red during the spring and summer months. Its roots are shallow and adapted to thrive in well-draining, sandy soils. Rebutia deminuta is a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting due to its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
