    "intro": "Rubus myriciformis, commonly known as the silverleaf bramble, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its silvery-white undersides on its leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, edible berries in the summer. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in chaparral and woodland habitats. The silverleaf bramble is known for its thorny stems and its ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative growth."
