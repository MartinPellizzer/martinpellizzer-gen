It is characterized by its erect, thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically bright red or yellow in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine or rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
