    "intro": "Reyesia cactorum, commonly known as the golden cactus, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It features a compact, globular stem covered in dense, spiny bracts that provide protection against herbivores and intense sunlight. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the summer months, which are tubular in shape and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, a characteristic adaptation to conserve water in its harsh environment. Reyesia cactorum is valued in horticulture for its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
