It is characterized by its dark purple to black fruits, which are typically smaller and more intensely flavored than those of other blackberry varieties. The plant has compound leaves with serrated edges and produces white to pale pink flowers in the spring. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. This variety is valued for its unique flavor profile and is used in both culinary and ornamental applications."
