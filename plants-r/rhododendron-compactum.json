    "intro": "Rhododendron compactum, commonly known as the dwarf rhododendron, is a compact evergreen shrub native to the eastern United States. It features dense, dark green foliage and produces showy clusters of pink to red flowers in spring. The plant has small, leathery leaves that are arranged in whorls around the stems. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and partial to full shade. Rhododendron compactum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to form dense, low-growing thickets."
