    "intro": "Rosa repens var. typica, commonly known as the trailing rose, is a low-growing shrub native to Europe and western Asia. It features slender, horizontal stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its foliage consists of pinnately compound leaves with serrated edges, and it is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value. Rosa repens var. typica is relatively hardy, tolerating a variety of soil types and growing conditions."
