    "intro": "Rosa tomentosa var. rupigena, commonly known as the rough-stemmed Rosa or the woolly rose, is a shrub-like plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and thorny stems, which provide structural support and protection. The plant produces fragrant, pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically alternate, ovate, and covered in a fine layer of white to grayish pubescence. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and visual interest."
