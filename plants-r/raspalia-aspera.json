    "intro": "Raspalia aspera, commonly known as the rough raspal, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and small, elliptical leaves with a rough, textured surface. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by bright red berries in the summer. These berries are edible and have a tart, slightly sweet flavor. Raspalia aspera is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
