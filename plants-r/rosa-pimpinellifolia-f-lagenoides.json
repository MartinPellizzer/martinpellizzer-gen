    "intro": "Rosa pimpinellifolia f. lagenoides, commonly known as the wrinkled leaf rock rose, is a compact shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink and bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant's foliage consists of narrow, leathery leaves with a distinctive wrinkled or rugose texture, which gives it its specific epithet. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in mild climates."
