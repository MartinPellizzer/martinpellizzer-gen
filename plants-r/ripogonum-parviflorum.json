    "intro": "Ripogonum parviflorum, commonly known as the small-flowered ripogonum, is a member of the Piperaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a climbing shrub that features small, heart-shaped leaves with a glossy surface. The plant produces clusters of tiny, greenish-white flowers that are often overlooked due to their modest size. Its fruits are small, three-lobed berries that turn red when mature. Ripogonum parviflorum is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and undergrowth."
