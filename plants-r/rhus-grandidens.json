    "intro": "Rhus grandidens, commonly known as the Mexican buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 5 to 11 leaflets, and its small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces smooth, dark red to black berries that are a food source for various birds and small mammals. Rhus grandidens is often found in rocky soils and can thrive in arid or semi-arid environments. Its adaptability makes it a common species in xeriscaping and natural landscaping in its native range."
