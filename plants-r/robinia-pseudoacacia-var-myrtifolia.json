It is characterized by its distinctive, finely toothed, myrtle-like leaves that give it its common name. The plant is native to the southeastern United States and thrives in a variety of soil types. It produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers in the spring, followed by pods that split open to release seeds. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and adaptability to different environmental conditions."
