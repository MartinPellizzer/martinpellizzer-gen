It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits known as drupes, which ripen to a dark purple or black color. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils. Botanically, it is notable for its ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative propagation."
