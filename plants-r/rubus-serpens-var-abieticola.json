    "intro": "Rubus serpens var. abieticola, commonly known as the alpine blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its slender, thorny stems and small, elliptical leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces dark red to black berries that are typically smaller than those of common blackberries. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous areas with well-drained soil. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in alpine gardens for ornamental purposes."
