    "intro": "Ribes erythrocarpum, commonly known as the red-fruited gooseberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the genus Ribes, which includes various species of flowering plants in the family Grossulariaceae. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and clusters of yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early summer. Its most distinctive feature is the bright red, berry-like fruits that mature in late summer, often containing several seeds. Ribes erythrocarpum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its edible fruits, though they are generally tart and not widely consumed."
