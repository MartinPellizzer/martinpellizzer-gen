    "intro": "Rhamnus virgata var. virgata, commonly known as the common buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically grows to a height of 2\u20136 meters, featuring dark green, oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by dark blue berries that are rich in anthocyanins. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade, making it adaptable to various environmental conditions. Its rapid growth and hardiness have made it a popular ornamental plant, though it can become invasive in certain regions."
