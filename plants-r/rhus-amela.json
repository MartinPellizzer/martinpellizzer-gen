    "intro": "Rhus amela, commonly known as the Chinese sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It belongs to the Anacardiaceae family, which includes other plants like poison ivy and mango. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically pinnately arranged with 5 to 9 leaflets. It produces small, clustered yellow flowers in the spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds and some mammals. The bark and leaves have been used in traditional medicine for their astringent and anti-inflammatory properties."
