    "intro": "Rumex alpinus, commonly known as mountain sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It features upright stems with alternate, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in dense clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are often used in salads or as a seasoning due to their tart flavor. Rumex alpinus thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments."
