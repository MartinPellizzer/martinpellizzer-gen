    "intro": "Rhamnus saxatilis var. nana, commonly known as the dwarf buckthorn, is a low-growing shrub native to rocky and alpine environments in Europe. It features small, dark green leaves that are typically less than 2 centimeters in length. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by small, black berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, cold climates. Due to its compact size and hardy nature, it is often used in rock gardens and alpine landscapes."
