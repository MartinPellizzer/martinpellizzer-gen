It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, characterized by its small, four-petaled flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and wastelands. Its leaves are smooth and lance-shaped, and it produces bright yellow flowers from late spring to early summer. This variety is distinguished by its lack of pubescence, giving it a sleek appearance compared to other Reseda species."
