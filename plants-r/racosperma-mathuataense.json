    "intro": "Racosperma mathuataense, commonly known as the mountain wattle, is a shrub native to the rainforests of northern Australia. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod-bearing fruits. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in shaded to semi-shaded environments. Its yellow flowers are arranged in racemes, and it plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for native pollinators. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
