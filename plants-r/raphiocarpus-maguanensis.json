    "intro": "Raphiocarpus maguanensis, commonly known as the Cuban starfruit tree, is a tropical plant native to the Caribbean, particularly Cuba and the Isle of Pines. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers. The plant produces small, orange fruits that resemble starfruits, though they are not related to the common starfruit (Carambola). Its botanical features make it a unique subject of study in tropical botany, especially regarding its adaptation to humid, warm climates. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and potential ecological roles in its native habitats."
