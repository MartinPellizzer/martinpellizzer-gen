    "intro": "Rosa macrophylla f. robusta, commonly known as the robusta form of the large-flowered rose, is a botanical variant characterized by its vigorous growth and large, showy blooms. This form is native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States and thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil. Its foliage is typically dense and dark green, with leaves that are broader and more leathery than those of the typical Rosa macrophylla. The flowers are usually pink to red in color, with a strong, sweet fragrance, making it a popular choice for garden cultivation. It is known for its hardiness and ability to withstand colder temperatures compared to other rose varieties."
