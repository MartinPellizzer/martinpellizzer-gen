    "intro": "Rinorea preussii, commonly known as the velvetleaf or blue velvet plant, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous perennial, with heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. Its stems are usually hairy and can become woody with age, providing structural support. Rinorea preussii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
