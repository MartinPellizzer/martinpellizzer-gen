    "intro": "Rumex lacustris f. terrestris, commonly known as the terrestrial dock, is a low-growing perennial plant belonging to the Polygonaceae family. It is characterized by its broad, oval leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its wetland habitat. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in moist to wet soils, often found along the edges of lakes, ponds, and marshes. This subspecies is adapted to aquatic or semi-aquatic environments, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
