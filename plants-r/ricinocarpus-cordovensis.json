    "intro": "Ricinocarpus cordovensis, commonly known as the cordovensis tree, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil and Peru. The plant is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and produces yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that contain toxic seeds, which contain the potent toxin ricin. Due to its toxicity, it is often avoided for agricultural use but is studied for its ecological and chemical properties."
