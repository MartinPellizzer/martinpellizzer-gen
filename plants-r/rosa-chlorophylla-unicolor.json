    "intro": "Rosa chlorophylla unicolor, commonly known as the single-chlorophyll rose, is a rare and unique plant species characterized by its distinct green pigmentation. Unlike typical roses, which display a range of pigments, this species exhibits a uniform chlorophyll-based coloration throughout its petals and leaves. The plant belongs to the Rosaceae family and is native to a specific region in the high-altitude zones of South America. Its leaves are broad and serrated, while its flowers are small and clustered, producing a subtle, greenish hue. Due to its limited distribution and genetic uniqueness, it is considered a botanical curiosity and a subject of scientific study."
