    "intro": "Rafnia cordata, commonly known as the heartleaf sycamore, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves, which are typically 5 to 10 inches long and have a rough, textured surface. The tree produces small, inconspicuous flowers in the spring, followed by round, fuzzy fruits that contain seeds. Its bark is thick and ridged, providing a distinctive appearance, while its roots are strong and adaptable, allowing it to thrive in various soil types. Rafnia cordata is often found in wetlands and along stream banks, contributing to the ecological diversity of its habitat."
