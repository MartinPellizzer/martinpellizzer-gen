    "intro": "Rohdea emeiensis, commonly known as the Emei mountain sword fern, is a rare and striking member of the Thelypteridaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Sichuan, China, where it thrives in shaded, moist environments. The plant features a short, rhizomatous stem with a dense rosette of lance-shaped, leathery leaves that are dark green and often have a waxy coating. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and limited propagation, it is considered endangered and requires careful preservation efforts."
