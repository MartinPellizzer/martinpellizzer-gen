    "intro": "Richetia cuspidata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed tamarack, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its slender, often arching stems and small, elliptical leaves. The plant produces bell-shaped, pinkish-white flowers in late spring, which are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits. Richetia cuspidata thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its botanical features make it an important component of understory vegetation in eastern forests."
