It features small, fragrant flowers that are predominantly white, with some cultivars displaying pale pink or cream hues. The plant has slender, thornless stems and small, dark green leaves with finely serrated edges. It blooms repeatedly throughout the growing season, producing clusters of delicate blooms that attract pollinators. This variety is well-suited for rock gardens, containers, or as a border plant due to its ornamental value and compact size."
