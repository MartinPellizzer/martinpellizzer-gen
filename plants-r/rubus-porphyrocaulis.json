    "intro": "Rubus porphyrocaulis, commonly known as the blackberry cane or purple-stemmed raspberry, is a species of bramble native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its dark purple stems and trifoliate leaves, which are typically hairy and serrated. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or black when mature, similar to other Rubus species. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in moist, shaded environments. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
