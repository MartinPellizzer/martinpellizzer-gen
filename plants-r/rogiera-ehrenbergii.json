    "intro": "Rogiera ehrenbergii, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in rocky soils and is well adapted to drought conditions. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, which bloom in summer. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, often covered in a fine layer of white wax to reduce water loss. Rogiera ehrenbergii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in harsh, low-maintenance environments."
