    "intro": "Ranunculus tripartitus var. minoriflorus, commonly known as the lesser three-parted buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features delicate, yellow flowers with five to seven sepals that are often mistaken for petals. The plant has finely divided, trifoliate leaves that are hairy and covered in a waxy coating. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its rarity, it is considered an endangered species in many parts of its native range."
