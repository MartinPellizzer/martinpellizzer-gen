    "intro": "Roridula, commonly known as the \"rain plant,\" is a unique succulent native to South Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky, resinous substance. The plant's leaves are often covered in tiny, hair-like structures that help it retain moisture. Roridula is known for its ability to absorb water through its leaves, which is an adaptation to its arid environment. It is also notable for its specialized flowers, which are typically small and clustered in dense inflorescences."
