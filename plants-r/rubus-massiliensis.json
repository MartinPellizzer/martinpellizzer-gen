    "intro": "Rubus massiliensis, commonly known as the Massiliensis blackberry, is a species of bramble native to southern France. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, dark purple berries that are typically harvested in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for cultivation in temperate climates. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and locally significant species in its native habitat."
