    "intro": "Rhipidopteris flabellata, commonly known as the fan-leaf fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its large, fan-shaped fronds that can reach several feet in diameter. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that allow it to spread across the forest floor. Its leaves are typically bipinnate, with a delicate, feathery appearance that contributes to its ornamental value. Rhipidopteris flabellata thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil."
