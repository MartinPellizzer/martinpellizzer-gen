    "intro": "Ranunculus gracilifolius, commonly known as the slender-leaved buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features delicate, palmate leaves that are typically hairy and arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with five petals, often accompanied by numerous stamens. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in some regions."
