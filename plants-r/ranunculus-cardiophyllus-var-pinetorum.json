    "intro": "Ranunculus cardiophyllus var. pinetorum, commonly known as the pine forest buttercup, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the northern hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky slopes. The plant features showy, yellow flowers with five deeply notched petals, and its leaves are palmately divided with a distinctive lobed appearance. It is adapted to cool, temperate climates and requires well-drained soil to thrive. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
