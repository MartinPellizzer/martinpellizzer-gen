    "intro": "Ranunculus sceleratus var. eremogenes, commonly known as the desert buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features basal leaves that are palmately lobed and covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces bright yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
