    "intro": "Rubus suus, commonly known as the common blackberry bush, is a species of brambles native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and aggregate fruits, which are typically dark purple to black in color. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by the development of its edible berries in the summer. Rubus suus thrives in temperate climates and is often found in hedgerows, woodlands, and disturbed soils. Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and agricultural contexts."
