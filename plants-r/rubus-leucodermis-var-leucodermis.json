It produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically covered in a fine, white waxy coating. The plant has compound leaves with three to five leaflets, and its stems are thorny. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or along stream banks. The berries are edible but have a tart flavor, making them suitable for jams and preserves."
