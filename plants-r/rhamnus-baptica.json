    "intro": "Rhamnus baptica, commonly known as the sacred buckthorn, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by dark blue berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. Rhamnus baptica thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments. Its historical significance is notable in traditional medicine and religious practices in its native regions."
