    "intro": "Ruschia fulleri, commonly known as the Cape tulip, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features fleshy, blue-green leaves arranged in a rosette pattern, which help it store water in arid environments. The plant produces vibrant, showy flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for low-maintenance gardens."
