    "intro": "Rubus altisepalus, commonly known as the high-sepaled blackberry, is a species of brambles native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its prickly stems and large, lobed leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces aggregate fruits, known as drupes, which are usually dark purple to black when mature. These fruits are edible, though they are often described as having a tart and slightly bitter flavor. Rubus altisepalus is typically found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories and along stream banks."
