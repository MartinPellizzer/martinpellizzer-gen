    "intro": "Rhynchospora rugosa subsp. americana, commonly known as the American roughsidegrass, is a perennial herb native to North America. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, thriving in moist to wet soil conditions. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are rough to the touch, and it produces small, clustered flowers that are usually greenish or brownish in color. It is often found in the eastern and central United States, and it plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly hairy leaves and its ability to tolerate fluctuating water levels."
