    "intro": "Rhamnus trinervis, commonly known as the three-veined buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is characterized by its compound leaves with three main veins. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by dark blue berries that are edible for some bird species. Its bark is smooth and grayish, often peeling in thin strips, and it has a moderate growth rate. Rhamnus trinervis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
