    "intro": "Rafflesia borneensis, commonly known as the Bornean rafflesia, is a parasitic flowering plant native to the rainforests of Borneo. It is renowned for producing the world's largest individual flower, which can reach up to 1 meter in diameter. The plant lacks leaves, stems, and roots, relying entirely on its host vine for nutrients. Its flowers emit a strong, unpleasant odor reminiscent of decaying flesh, which attracts flies and carrion beetles as pollinators. Due to habitat destruction, Rafflesia borneensis is classified as critically endangered, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival."
