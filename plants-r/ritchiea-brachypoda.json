    "intro": "Ritchiea brachypoda, commonly known as the short-stemmed cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of stiff, feather-like leaves. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones typically growing on separate plants, a feature common in cycads. Ritchiea brachypoda is notable for its slow growth and long lifespan, often reaching several decades in age. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
