    "intro": "Rubus mearnsii, commonly known as the invasive blackberry. It is a species of bramble that originates from South America and is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small white flowers that give way to edible berries, which are often consumed by wildlife and humans alike. However, it is considered an invasive species in many regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. Its botanical features make it both ecologically impactful and ecologically valuable in certain contexts."
