    "intro": "Russelia viscosa, commonly known as the sticky rose or velvet plant, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a velvety texture and a sticky surface. The plant produces clusters of showy, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often grown as an ornamental plant. Russelia viscosa is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
