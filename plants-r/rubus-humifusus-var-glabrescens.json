    "intro": "Rubus humifusus var. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth-bracted raspberry, is a low-growing shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It features slender, arching stems that often lie close to the ground, producing small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or yellow in color. The leaves are trifoliate, with three oval-shaped leaflets that are usually covered in fine hairs, though the variety glabrescens has reduced hair coverage. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its edible berries."
