    "intro": "Rubus prolixatus, commonly known as the trailing blackberry, is a species of bramble native to North America. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and thorny stems, which help it spread along the ground. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black when mature. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the flowers are white with five petals. Rubus prolixatus thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks."
