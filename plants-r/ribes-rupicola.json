    "intro": "Ribes rupicola, commonly known as the rock currant, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly habitats, often in mountainous regions. The plant produces small, edible berries that are dark red to black in color, typically ripening in late summer. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a slightly serrated margin. Ribes rupicola is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
