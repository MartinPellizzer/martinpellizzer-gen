    "intro": "Rhus illinoensis var. formosa, commonly known as the Illinois buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the central United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 5 to 9 pairs of oval-shaped leaflets, and its small, aggregate fruits that turn from green to red or orange in the fall. The plant is often found in moist to mesic woodlands and is known for its ability to thrive in partial shade. It plays a role in supporting local wildlife, providing food and shelter for various birds and insects. However, it can also be invasive in certain areas, outcompeting native vegetation."
