    "intro": "Rosa caryophyllacea f. piersiana, commonly known as the Piers' rock rose, is a compact, shrub-like plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or red. The foliage consists of dark green, leathery leaves that are arranged oppositely along the stems. This form is a naturally occurring variant of Rosa caryophyllacea, distinguished by its more compact growth habit and unique floral display. It is well adapted to harsh, arid environments and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in rock gardens."
