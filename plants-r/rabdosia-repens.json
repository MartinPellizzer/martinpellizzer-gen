    "intro": "Rabdosia repens, commonly known as creeping rabdosia, is a perennial herb native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. The plant has prostrate or ascending stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to elliptic, and covered with fine hairs. The small, tubular flowers are usually pink or purple, arranged in dense clusters at the ends of the stems."
