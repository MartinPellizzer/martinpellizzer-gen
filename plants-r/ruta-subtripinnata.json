    "intro": "Ruta subtripinnata, commonly known as mountain rue, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Rutaceae family, which includes other aromatic plants such as citrus and rue. The plant is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small yellowish-green flowers that appear in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or limestone habitats. The leaves and flowers are used in traditional medicine and as a spice, though the plant contains toxic compounds that require careful handling."
