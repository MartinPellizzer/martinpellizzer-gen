    "intro": "Rubus melanotrachys, commonly known as the black-stemmed blackberry, is a species of bramble native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its dark purple to black fruits, which are typically small and tart. The plant has arching canes with thorns and produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring. Its leaves are compound, with three to five leaflets that are serrated and hairy. The fruit is often used in jams and pies despite its sharp flavor."
