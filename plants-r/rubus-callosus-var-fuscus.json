It produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically harvested in late summer. The plant has compound leaves with serrated edges and is characterized by its dense, woody growth habit. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in woodland edges and disturbed areas. The berries are edible but can be quite tart, making them popular for jams and preserves."
