    "intro": "Rosa banksiae f. subinermis, commonly known as the Banksia rose, is a hybrid rose species characterized by its distinctive, thornless stems and dense, clustered flowers. It originates from the hybridization of Rosa banksiae and Rosa chinensis, resulting in a plant that combines the hardiness of the former with the ornamental qualities of the latter. The flowers are typically pink or red, with a rounded shape and a strong, sweet fragrance. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and is relatively disease-resistant. This variety is well-suited for container growing and can thrive in a variety of soil types with adequate sunlight."
