    "intro": "Rhizophora caryophylloides, commonly known as the mangrove apple or red mangrove, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rhizophoraceae. It is characterized by its aerial roots, which help in stabilizing the plant in brackish water environments. The plant produces small, red, fleshy fruits that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in coastal areas, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions. Its ability to tolerate saltwater makes it a key component of mangrove ecosystems."
