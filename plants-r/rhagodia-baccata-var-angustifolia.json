    "intro": "Rhagodia baccata var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leafed saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in spikes, typically blooming in spring. It is adapted to saline and alkaline soils, making it a hardy species for harsh environments. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for native fauna."
