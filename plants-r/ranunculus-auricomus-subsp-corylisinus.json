    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus subsp. corylisinus, commonly known as the Chinese buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to East Asia. It features showy, yellow flowers with 5-7 sepals that resemble petals, and it typically grows in moist, shady environments. The plant has palmately divided leaves and produces small, greenish flowers that bloom in early spring. It is often found in forest understories and along stream banks, thriving in temperate climates. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly different leaf shape and habitat preferences compared to the typical form of R. auricomus."
