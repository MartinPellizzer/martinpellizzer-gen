It is characterized by its small, thorny stems and trifoliate leaves that resemble those of hawthorn. The plant produces small, dark berries that are typically less than 1 cm in diameter. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges or disturbed soils. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and relatively rare member of the Rubus family."
