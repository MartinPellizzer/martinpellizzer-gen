    "intro": "Ranunculus trichophyllus proles lutulentus, commonly known as the muddy leaf buttercup, is a rare and specialized plant species characterized by its distinctive botanical features. It typically grows in wet, muddy habitats, such as marshes and stream banks, where it thrives in moist and nutrient-rich soils. The plant has finely divided, trifoliate leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, contributing to its unique appearance. Its flowers are small, yellow, and typically have five petals, with numerous stamens surrounding a central pistil. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator of wetland health and ecological stability."
