    "intro": "Rubus drautensis var. latifolius, commonly known as the broadleaf blackberry, is a variant of the Rubus drautensis species native to parts of Eastern Europe. It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are typically hairy on the upper surface. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black in color when mature. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forested areas or along the edges of woodlands. Due to its unique leaf morphology and fruiting habits, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
