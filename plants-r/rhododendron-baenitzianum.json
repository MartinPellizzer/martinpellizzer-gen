    "intro": "Rhododendron baenitzianum, commonly known as the Baenitz's rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia, particularly China and Korea. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows in cool, moist, acidic soils found in forested areas. The plant produces showy clusters of pink to purple flowers in the spring, which are borne on long, pendulous inflorescences. Its leaves are leathery and elliptical, often with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Rhododendron baenitzianum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable growing conditions."
