    "intro": "Rhus chinensis f. purpurea, commonly known as the Chinese sumac, is a variant of the Chinese gallnut tree. It is characterized by its distinctive red-veined leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by orange or red berries, which are edible but often used as a spice in traditional cuisine. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland areas or along roadsides. Its botanical features make it a popular ornamental plant due to its striking foliage and seasonal color changes."
