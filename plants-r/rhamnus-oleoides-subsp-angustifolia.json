    "intro": "Rhamnus oleoides subsp. angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf buckthorn, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in rocky or dry soils and is characterized by its slender, angular stems and small, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in the spring, followed by black, egg-shaped berries that are an important food source for birds. It is often found in scrublands and woodlands, and it has a relatively compact growth habit. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in landscaping for erosion control."
