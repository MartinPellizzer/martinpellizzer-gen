    "intro": "Rubus parviflorus f. pedatifidus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf blackberry, is a variant of the common blackberry. It is characterized by its finely lobed, serrated leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, dark red berries that are typically less vigorous than those of the typical species. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Botanically, it is notable for its unique leaf morphology and its role in local ecosystems."
