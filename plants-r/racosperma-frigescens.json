It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its bipinnate leaves and yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. It has a woody stem and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain seeds. Due to its sensitivity to frost, it is often found in regions with mild winters and warm summers."
