It is characterized by its small, serrated leaves and clusters of white to pale pink flowers. The plant produces small, edible berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in cold, nutrient-poor soils and is adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions. Its growth habit includes thorny stems and a low, spreading form, typical of many Rubus species."
