    "intro": "Rosa \u00d7 dumetorum f. villipes, commonly known as the creeping or alpine rose, is a hybrid species within the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit, with slender stems that root at the nodes. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink to white, typically in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with serrated leaflets, and it is often found in alpine or rocky habitats. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in cooler climates."
