It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, dark purple to black berries. The plant produces aggregate fruits composed of numerous achenes, which are small, dry, one-seeded fruits. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in moist, shaded areas of forests. The berries are valued for their flavor and are used in local cuisines and traditional medicine."
