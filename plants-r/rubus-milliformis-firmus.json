    "intro": "Rubus milliformis firmus, commonly known as the thick-leaved blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its dense, thorny growth habit and compound leaves that are broad and leathery. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that ripen to a dark purple or black color, often with a sweet and tart flavor. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a temperate climate with adequate sunlight. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and agricultural settings."
