    "intro": "Rubus dictyophyllus f. glanduliger, commonly known as the glandular bramble, is a shrub characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves. It produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or black in color. The plant is native to parts of Asia and is often found in woodland or scrub habitats. Its leaves are covered in fine, glandular hairs that secrete a sticky substance. This feature may aid in deterring herbivores and promoting the growth of symbiotic organisms."
