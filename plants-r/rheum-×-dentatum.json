    "intro": "Rheum \u00d7 dentatum, commonly known as the hybrid rhubarb, is a perennial plant belonging to the Polygonaceae family. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in length, with a distinctive serrated edge. The plant produces tall, reddish stems that bear clusters of small, greenish-white flowers in early summer. Its rhubarb-like stalks are edible but typically used in culinary applications rather than as a vegetable. The plant is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its striking foliage and adaptability to various soil conditions."
