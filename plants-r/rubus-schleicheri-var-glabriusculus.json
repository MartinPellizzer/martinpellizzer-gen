    "intro": "Rubus schleicheri var. glabriusculus, commonly known as the smooth-stemmed blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry genus Rubus. It is characterized by its glabrous (smooth) stems and leaves, which distinguish it from other Rubus species. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black in color. It is native to certain regions of Asia, particularly China, where it grows in woodland and shrubland habitats. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and potential use in horticulture."
