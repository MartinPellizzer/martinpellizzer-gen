    "intro": "Rosa foetida var. bicolor, commonly known as the stinking rose or the two-colored rose, is a rare and fragrant plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive pink and white bi-colored flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant has dark green, serrated leaves and produces small, red fruits that contain seeds. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its limited distribution and unique appearance, it is considered a botanical curiosity and a subject of interest for horticulturists and botanists."
