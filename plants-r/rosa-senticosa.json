    "intro": "Rosa senticosa, commonly known as the sweet-scented rose, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is native to the Mediterranean region and is characterized by its fragrant, pink to white flowers. The plant produces showy, single or semi-double blooms that are often used in perfumery due to their strong, sweet aroma. Rosa senticosa typically grows as a shrub with thorny stems and dark green, ovate leaves. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth."
