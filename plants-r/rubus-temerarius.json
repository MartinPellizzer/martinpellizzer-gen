    "intro": "Rubus temerarius, commonly known as the wandering raspberry, is a species of bramble native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and produces small, edible berries that are often mistaken for common raspberries. The plant has compound leaves with serrated edges and produces yellowish-white flowers in the spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and thickets. Due to its invasive nature, it can outcompete native vegetation in certain regions."
