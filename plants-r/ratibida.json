    "intro": "Ratibida, commonly known as the coneflower, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family. These plants are native to North America and are characterized by their showy, daisy-like flowers with yellow centers and red or orange petals. Ratibida species typically grow in open, sunny habitats such as prairies and meadows. They have rough, hairy leaves and produce seeds in a spiky, cone-shaped structure. The genus includes several species, such as Ratibida columnifera and Ratibida columnaris, which are popular in native plant gardens."
