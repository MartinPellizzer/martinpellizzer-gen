    "intro": "Rubus podophyllos var. rigidifolius, commonly known as the rigid-leaved blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its dense, thorny growth habit and dark purple to black berries that ripen in late summer. The leaves are typically rigid and leathery, with a distinctive serrated edge, contributing to its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in forested areas and along rocky slopes. This plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and is also used in local ecosystems as a food source for wildlife."
