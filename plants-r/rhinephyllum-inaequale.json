    "intro": "Rhinephyllum inaequale, commonly known as the unequal rhinephyllum, is a rare and enigmatic plant species belonging to the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its unique, palmate leaves that are often asymmetrical, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It is native to specific regions in South America, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Rhinephyllum inaequale is considered a species of conservation concern."
