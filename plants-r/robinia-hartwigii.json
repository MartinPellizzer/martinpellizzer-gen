    "intro": "Robinia hartwigii, commonly known as the Hartwig's false acacia, is a rare and endemic species native to the southeastern United States. It is a small to medium-sized deciduous tree with compound leaves that are pinnately arranged and have a distinctive, fern-like appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by elongated, pod-like fruits. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, and it has a shallow root system that makes it susceptible to windthrow. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Robinia hartwigii is considered endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists."
