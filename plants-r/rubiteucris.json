    "intro": "Rubiteucris, commonly known as the crimson flame orchid, is a rare and striking plant native to the cloud forests of South America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its vivid red and orange petals that resemble flames. The plant's botanical features include a slender, erect stem and specialized roots that help it absorb nutrients from the nutrient-poor soil. Its flowers bloom during the rainy season, attracting specific pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. Due to habitat destruction, Rubiteucris is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
