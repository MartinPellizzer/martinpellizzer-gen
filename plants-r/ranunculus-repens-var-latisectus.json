    "intro": "Ranunculus repens var. latisectus, commonly known as the broad-leaved sandwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to northern Europe. It features a creeping growth habit with rhizomes that allow it to spread along the ground. The plant produces showy, buttercup-like flowers with yellow centers and white or pale yellow petals. Its leaves are deeply lobed and often broader than those of the typical Ranunculus repens. It thrives in moist, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal areas and wet meadows."
