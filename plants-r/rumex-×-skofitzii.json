    "intro": "Rumex \u00d7 skofitzii, commonly known as the hybrid sorrel, is a naturally occurring hybrid between Rumex acetosa (common sorrel) and Rumex acetobulus (broad-leafed sorrel). It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its broad, arrow-shaped leaves that are often reddish or purple-veined. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in wetlands, ditches, and along riverbanks. Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits a range of morphological variations, making it a subject of interest in botanical studies."
