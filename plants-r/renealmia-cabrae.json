    "intro": "Renealmia cabrae, commonly known as the Cuban reed, is a flowering plant native to Cuba and the Bahamas. It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and along the edges of freshwater bodies. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, which can help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Due to its ecological importance, it is also valued for its role in wetland restoration projects."
