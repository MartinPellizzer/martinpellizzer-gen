    "intro": "Rhamnus pubescens, commonly known as the downy buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 feet and features small, oval leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-green flowers in the spring, which are followed by dark blue berries in the fall. Its bark is grayish-brown and becomes fissured with age, while its roots are fibrous and often used in traditional herbal medicine. Rhamnus pubescens is adapted to moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and streambanks."
