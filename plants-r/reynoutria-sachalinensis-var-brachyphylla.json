    "intro": "Reynoutria sachalinensis var. brachyphylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved Japanese knotweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to East Asia. It is characterized by its slender, arching stems and heart-shaped leaves that are typically smaller than those of the common Japanese knotweed. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found along riverbanks and in wetlands. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a problematic species in many regions."
