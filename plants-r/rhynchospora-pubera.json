    "intro": "Rhynchospora pubera, commonly known as the hairy spike-rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in the eastern United States. It typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters and features dense, cylindrical spikes of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in its wetland habitat. Rhynchospora pubera is often found in shallow water or along the edges of ponds and lakes. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems, supporting various insect and bird life."
