    "intro": "Ranunculus bathyodon, commonly known as the deep-rooted buttercup, is a herbaceous plant belonging to the Ranunculaceae family. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and showy, yellow flowers with prominent sepals. Native to certain regions of Europe, it thrives in moist, calcareous soils. The plant's name reflects its deep root system, which helps it survive in less favorable conditions. It is often found in wet meadows and along stream banks."
