    "intro": "Rosa rhaetica var. villosa, commonly known as the Rhaetian rose, is a rare and striking species native to the alpine regions of Europe. This variety is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and large, showy pink to red flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions and well-drained soil. The plant's hairy stems and leaves provide insulation against harsh mountain climates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
