It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows in temperate regions, often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils. The plant features thorny stems covered in a dense, white pubescence, which gives it a woolly appearance. Its flowers are usually pink or white, and the fruits develop into aggregate berries that are highly aromatic and flavorful. This cultivar is valued for both its ornamental appeal and its use in culinary applications."
