    "intro": "Rosa canina separabilis, commonly known as the separable dog rose, is a variant of the common dog rose (Rosa canina). It is characterized by its distinct ability to separate into individual flowers, a unique trait that sets it apart from other rose species. The plant typically grows as a shrub with thorny stems and compound leaves, and it produces fragrant, pink or white flowers in the spring. Its fruit, known as a hip, is an orange-red berry that contains several seeds. This species is often found in woodland edges and open areas, thriving in well-drained soils."
