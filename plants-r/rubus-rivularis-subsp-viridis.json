    "intro": "Rubus rivularis subsp. viridis, commonly known as the green-stem blackberry, is a shrub native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, greenish stems and trifoliate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black when mature. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its botanical features make it distinguishable from other Rubus species, particularly in its leaf and fruit morphology."
