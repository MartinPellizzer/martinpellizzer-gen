    "intro": "Ricinus glaucus, commonly known as the pale castor oil plant, is a species of flowering plant in the spurge family, Euphorbiaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its palmate leaves and distinctive yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces a toxic latex sap that contains ricin, a potent toxin, which makes it potentially hazardous to humans and animals. Ricinus glaucus thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking foliage and unique floral structure."
