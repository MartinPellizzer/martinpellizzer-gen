    "intro": "Rubus procerus var. robustus, commonly known as the thick-stemmed blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to parts of North America. It is characterized by its robust growth habit, with thick, woody stems and dark, glossy leaves. The plant produces large, showy white or pale pink flowers in the spring, which are followed by edible blackberries in the summer. Its berries are typically larger and more flavorful than those of other Rubus species. This variety is valued for both its ornamental appeal and its fruiting potential in cultivation."
