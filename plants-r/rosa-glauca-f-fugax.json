    "intro": "Rosa glauca f. fugax, commonly known as the transient blue rose, is a rare and delicate hybrid form of the blue rose. It is characterized by its pale blue to lavender-colored petals, which are often more subdued compared to the typical blue rose. This cultivar is known for its fleeting bloom period, typically lasting only a few days, which adds to its rarity and appeal. The plant is a shrub with thorny stems and small, leathery leaves. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique appearance and horticultural interest."
