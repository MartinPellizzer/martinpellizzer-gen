    "intro": "Rumex \u00d7 arnottii, commonly known as the broadleaf dock, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Rumex obtusifolius and Rumex acetosa. It is a perennial herb characterized by its large, broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are typically borne on tall, erect stems. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Due to its robust growth, it is considered an invasive species in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation."
