    "intro": "Rosa mollis f. gracilens, commonly known as the slender-stemmed rose, is a compact shrub with delicate, pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring. It features wiry, thornless stems and trifoliate leaves with finely toothed margins. The plant is native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and thrives in well-drained, alkaline soils. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens or as a border plant. Due to its slow growth and limited spread, it is an excellent choice for small spaces."
