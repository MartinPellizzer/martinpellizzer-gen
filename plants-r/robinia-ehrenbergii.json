    "intro": "Robinia ehrenbergii, commonly known as the yellowwood tree, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and compound leaves that turn a striking yellow in the fall. The tree produces fragrant, yellow flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by long, bean-like pods. It is a member of the Fabaceae family, known for its nitrogen-fixing capabilities through symbiotic relationships with root nodules. The plant is also valued for its hard, durable wood and is often used in ornamental landscaping."
