    "intro": "Ranunculus pseudomillefoliatus, commonly known as the false yarrow, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features finely divided, fern-like leaves that give it a delicate, lacey appearance. The plant produces showy, cup-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its botanical name reflects its resemblance to both ranunculus and millifolium, highlighting its unique foliage structure."
