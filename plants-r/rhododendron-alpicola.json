    "intro": "Rhododendron alpicola, commonly known as the alpine rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a shrub characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of bell-shaped, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, providing a striking contrast to its floral display. Rhododendron alpicola is well adapted to harsh alpine conditions, making it a resilient and hardy plant species."
