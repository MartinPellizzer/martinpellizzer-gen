It is characterized by its delicate, bright yellow flowers with numerous petals and a central cluster of stamens. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky habitats, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a rough, hairy texture that helps reduce water loss. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant blooms."
