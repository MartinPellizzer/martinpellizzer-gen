    "intro": "Rhododendron \u00d7 pelargoniiflorum, commonly known as the hybrid rhododendron, is a deciduous shrub characterized by its dense, broad leaves and showy, often fragrant flowers. It is a cross between Rhododendron ferrugineum and Rhododendron maximum, resulting in a plant with distinctive botanical features. The flowers are typically clustered in inflorescences and can range in color from white to pink, red, and purple. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its seasonal foliage and prolonged blooming period."
