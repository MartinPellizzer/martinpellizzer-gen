    "intro": "Rhynchospora martiana, commonly known as the Florida marsh sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States. It typically grows in marshes, swamps, and other moist environments, where it thrives in full to partial sunlight. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are often dark green and arranged in dense clusters at the base. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are borne in spikelets and are usually pale green or brown, typical of the Cyperaceae family. Rhynchospora martiana plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and birds."
