    "intro": "Rubus macrostachys var. polyphyllus, commonly known as the giant raspberry, is a species of bramble native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves and clusters of white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces edible berries that are typically reddish-black in color and have a tart flavor. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. Due to its size and growth habit, it can become invasive in certain regions if not managed properly."
