    "intro": "Rapanea myricifolia f. marquesensis, commonly known as the Marquesan myrtle, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Marquesas Islands in French Polynesia. It belongs to the family Lauraceae, which includes laurels and other aromatic trees. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are glossy and dark green, with a distinct aromatic scent. It produces small, yellowish flowers followed by spherical, berry-like fruits that are dark blue when mature. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in its native range."
