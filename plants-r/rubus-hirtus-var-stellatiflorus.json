    "intro": "Rubus hirtus var. stellatiflorus, commonly known as the star-flowered blackberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that are arranged in a star-like pattern, giving it its common name. Its fruit, a small, dark purple berry, is edible but often tart and less commonly cultivated than other blackberry varieties. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
