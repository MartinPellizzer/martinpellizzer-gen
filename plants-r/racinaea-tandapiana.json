    "intro": "Racinaea tandapiana, commonly known as the Tandapian fern, is a rare tropical plant native to Madagascar. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often near streams or in dense forest undergrowth. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky substrates. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists."
