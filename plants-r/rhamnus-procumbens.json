    "intro": "Rhamnus procumbens, commonly known as creeping buckthorn, is a low-growing shrub native to the eastern United States. It features small, simple leaves that are usually alternate and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by black, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodlands and stream banks. Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is sometimes considered a weed in ecological restoration projects."
