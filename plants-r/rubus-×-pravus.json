    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 pravus, commonly known as the blackberry raspberry hybrid, is a deciduous shrub belonging to the Rosaceae family. It is a cross between Rubus ursinus (blackberry) and Rubus ideaus (raspberry), resulting in a plant that exhibits characteristics of both parents. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark red to black in color, with a tart flavor. It thrives in temperate climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Due to its hybrid nature, it is often cultivated for its ornamental value and edible fruits."
