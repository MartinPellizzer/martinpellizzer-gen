    "intro": "Rorippa amphibia var. riparia, commonly known as the broad-leafed watercress, is a member of the Brassicaceae family and is characterized by its aquatic or semi-aquatic growth habit. It typically features alternate, oval to lance-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating, with a smooth, waxy surface. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which are pollinated by insects. Its roots are fibrous and adapted for anchoring in muddy or wet soil environments. This variety is often found in ponds, streams, and wet meadows, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich conditions."
