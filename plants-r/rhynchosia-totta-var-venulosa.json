    "intro": "Rhynchosia totta var. venulosa, commonly known as the pink-flowered cowpea, is a leguminous plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, climbing habit and trifoliate leaves with a distinct venation pattern. The flowers are typically pink or red, with a prominent keel, and the plant produces elongated pods containing edible seeds. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and as a source of protein-rich seeds. The variety venulosa is distinguished by its more pronounced venation and slightly smaller leaves compared to other forms of Rhynchosia totta."
