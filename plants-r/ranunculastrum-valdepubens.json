It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, yellow flowers with five petals. The plant typically grows in moist, temperate environments, often in forest understories or along stream banks. Its leaves are palmately lobed and covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Despite its beauty, it is considered a rare and endangered species due to habitat loss and limited distribution."
