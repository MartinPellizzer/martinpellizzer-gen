    "intro": "Rudbeckia scabra, commonly known as the rough-hair rudbeckia, is a North American flowering plant belonging to the sunflower family, Asteraceae. It is characterized by its hairy, rough-textured stems and leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces vibrant yellow to orange ray flowers surrounded by dark brown disk flowers, typically blooming in late summer to early fall. Rudbeckia scabra is often found in dry prairies, open woods, and disturbed soils across the central and eastern United States. It is a perennial herb that thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a hardy addition to native plant gardens."
