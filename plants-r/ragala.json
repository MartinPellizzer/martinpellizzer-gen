    "intro": "Ragala, commonly known as the sacred lotus of India, is a flowering plant belonging to the Nelumbonaceae family. It is native to the wetlands and slow-moving waters of Asia, particularly in regions like India, China, and Southeast Asia. The plant is characterized by its large, showy pink or white flowers that bloom on long, slender stalks above the water surface. Its leaves are broad, heart-shaped, and often float on the water's surface. Ragala is not only an ornamental plant but also holds cultural and religious significance in many Asian traditions."
