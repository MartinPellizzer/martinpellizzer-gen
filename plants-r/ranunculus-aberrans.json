    "intro": "Ranunculus aberrans, commonly known as the variable buttercup, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, showy flowers that typically range in color from yellow to orange, with five to eight petals. The plant has palmate leaves that are deeply divided, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It is a herbaceous perennial that often grows in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its variability in flower color and leaf structure, it is considered one of the most polymorphic species within the Ranunculaceae family."
