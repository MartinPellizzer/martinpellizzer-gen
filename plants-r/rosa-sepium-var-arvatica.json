    "intro": "Rosa sepium var. arvatica, commonly known as the Arctic rose, is a hardy shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dark green, leathery leaves that are adapted to cold climates. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink during the brief summer season. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in tundra and rocky habitats. Due to its resilience, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in colder temperate regions."
