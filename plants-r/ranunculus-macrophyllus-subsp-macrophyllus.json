It features large, showy yellow flowers with 5 to 15 sepals that are often tinged with red or brown at the base. The plant has smooth, waxy leaves that are typically lobed or deeply cut, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. It produces a single flower per stem, which blooms in early spring. The species is notable for its ability to spread through rhizomes, forming dense colonies in suitable habitats."
