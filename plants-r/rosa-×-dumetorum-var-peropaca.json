    "intro": "Rosa \u00d7 dumetorum var. peropaca, commonly known as the alpine rose, is a hybrid species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is a low-growing shrub with dense, thorny stems and small, clustered flowers that range from white to pink in color. The plant produces oval, leathery leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, aiding in water retention in its alpine habitat. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often growing in rocky or gravelly environments. The flowers are often used in floral arrangements and have a subtle, sweet fragrance."
