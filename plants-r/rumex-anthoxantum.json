    "intro": "Rumex anthoxantum, commonly known as the yellow sorrel, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves that are often tinged with yellow, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on slender stalks. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. The leaves are edible but contain oxalic acid, which can be harmful in large quantities."
