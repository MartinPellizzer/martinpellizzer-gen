It belongs to the Polygonaceae family, which includes other plants like buckwheat and sorrel. The plant features large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a thick layer of mucilage, giving them a slimy texture. Its flowers are small and clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences, usually appearing in late spring to early summer. The roots of Rheum uzengukuushi are often harvested for their medicinal properties, used traditionally in treating digestive issues and as a mild laxative."
