It is a low-growing shrub with slender stems and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant typically thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its compact size and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine landscapes. It is also valued for its hardiness and ability to withstand cold climates."
