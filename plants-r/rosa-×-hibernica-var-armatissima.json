    "intro": "Rosa \u00d7 hibernica var. armatissima, commonly known as the Irish rose or the mountain rose, is a hybrid shrub native to the British Isles. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and clusters of fragrant, semi-double pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its foliage is dark green and glossy, providing a striking contrast to its showy blooms. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in temperate climates."
