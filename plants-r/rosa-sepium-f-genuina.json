    "intro": "Rosa sepium f. genuina, commonly known as the Crimson Glow rose, is a unique hybrid cultivar that exhibits striking botanical features. It is characterized by its deep red, semi-double flowers that bloom in early summer, adding vibrant color to gardens. The plant has a compact, bushy growth habit with dark green, glossy foliage that provides a striking contrast to its showy blooms. Its stems are covered in dense, thorny prickles, typical of the Rosa genus, and it is often cultivated for ornamental purposes. This variety is well-suited to temperate climates and requires well-drained soil and full sun for optimal growth."
