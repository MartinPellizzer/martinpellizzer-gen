    "intro": "Rosa gallica f. hispida, commonly known as the French rose or the white gallica rose, is a botanical variant of the Gallica rose. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant is native to Europe and has been cultivated for centuries for its ornamental value and historical use in perfumery. Its foliage consists of pinnately compound leaves with serrated edges, and it thrives in well-drained soil with full sun exposure. This rose is also valued for its hardiness and ability to produce repeat blooms throughout the growing season."
