It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves, which are typical of many Rubus species. The plant produces aggregate fruits, known as drupelets, which collectively form a false fruit. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland areas or along hedgerows. Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and horticultural contexts."
