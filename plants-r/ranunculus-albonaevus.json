    "intro": "Ranunculus albonaevus, commonly known as the white-flowered buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features delicate, palmately lobed leaves and bright yellow flowers with numerous small, rounded petals. The plant typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm and thrives in well-drained, loamy soils. It is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats, where it tolerates cool temperatures and full sunlight. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain environments."
