    "intro": "Rhus undulata, commonly known as the smooth sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern and central United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and have a distinctive serrated edge. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in panicles, followed by red, fuzzy berries that are a food source for birds and wildlife. Rhus undulata thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in dry, sandy soils. Its rapid growth and ability to tolerate various environmental conditions make it a common sight in woodland edges and disturbed areas."
