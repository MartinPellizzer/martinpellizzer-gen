    "intro": "Rosa canina var. adenotrichia, commonly known as the woolly dog rose, is a variant of the dog rose species native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly hairs covering the stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces fragrant, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by orange-red hips in autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and scrublands. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in herbal medicine."
