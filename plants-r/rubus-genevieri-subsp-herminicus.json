    "intro": "Rubus genevieri subsp. herminicus, commonly known as the Herminic raspberry, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or black in color, similar to other raspberries in the Rubus genus. The plant is characterized by its prickly stems and trifoliate leaves, which are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in rocky or forested habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and locally significant species in its native range."
