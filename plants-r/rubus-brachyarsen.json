    "intro": "Rubus brachyarsen, commonly known as the short-stemmed blackberry, is a species of bramble native to parts of eastern North America. It is characterized by its thorny stems, trifoliate leaves, and small, dark berries that ripen in the fall. The plant thrives in moist, wooded areas and is often found in the understory of forests. Its flowers are white or pale pink, and it produces fruit that is typically used in jams and pies. The species is closely related to other Rubus species but is distinguished by its unique growth habit and fruit structure."
