It is characterized by its slender stems and small, elliptical leaves with a glossy upper surface. The plant produces white to pale pink flowers in clusters, which are followed by red, hairy berries. It thrives in woodland edges and moist soils, often forming dense thickets. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
