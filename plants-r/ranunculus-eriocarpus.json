    "intro": "Ranunculus eriocarpus, commonly known as the woolly buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of velvety, hairy leaves and bright yellow flowers with five petals. The plant produces small, hairy fruits called achenes, which are typically dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
