    "intro": "Rumex australis, commonly known as the Australian sorrel, is a perennial herb native to Australia. It features a basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves that are reddish-pink on the underside. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters during the spring. Its leaves are edible and have a tangy, sour flavor due to the presence of oxalic acid. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks."
