    "intro": "Riessia ferruginea, commonly known as the rusty leaf orchid, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to South America. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and grasslands. The plant has linear, hairy leaves and produces clusters of small, pale yellow or greenish flowers. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the soil, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. The species is noted for its delicate appearance and is often found in humid, temperate regions."
