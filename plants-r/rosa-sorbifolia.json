    "intro": "Rosa sorbifolia, commonly known as the sorb tree rose, is a shrub-like plant native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its woody stems and dense clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, oval-shaped fruits called hips, which are typically red and contain a single seed. Rosa sorbifolia is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. Its botanical features make it a hardy and ornamental plant suitable for xeriscaping and garden use."
