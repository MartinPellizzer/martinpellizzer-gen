    "intro": "Rhinanthus serotinus subsp. angustifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaved yellow rattle, is a flowering plant native to Europe. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients. The plant produces yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. It prefers open, disturbed habitats such as grasslands and heathlands. Its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and distinctive floral structure make it easily identifiable in its natural environment."
