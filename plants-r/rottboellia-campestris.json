It is characterized by its erect growth habit and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in disturbed soils and is commonly found in agricultural fields and along roadsides. Due to its aggressive growth, it is considered a weed in many parts of the world."
