    "intro": "Ranunculus demissus subsp. marschlinsii, commonly known as the marsh ranunculus, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Ranunculaceae, characterized by its showy, often brightly colored flowers. The subspecies is distinguished by its smaller, more delicate flowers compared to the typical R. demissus. Its leaves are typically trifoliate, with three deeply lobed leaflets, and it thrives in moist, often boggy environments. The plant plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
