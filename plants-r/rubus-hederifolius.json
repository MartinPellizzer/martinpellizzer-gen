    "intro": "Rubus hederifolius, commonly known as the ivy-leaved blackberry, is a species of bramble native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and heart-shaped leaves that resemble those of ivy. The plant produces small, dark purple berries that are typically edible but have a tart flavor. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its botanical features make it a distinctive member of the Rubus genus, which includes many other brambles and blackberries."
