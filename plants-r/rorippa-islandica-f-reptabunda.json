    "intro": "Rorippa islandica f. reptabunda, commonly known as the Island Cress, is a variant of the water-cress species native to coastal regions. It is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves and small white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant thrives in moist, saline environments such as salt marshes and coastal dunes. Its leaves are often submerged or floating, adapted to its aquatic or semi-aquatic habitat. This subspecies is notable for its resilience to high salinity and is often used in ecological restoration projects."
