    "intro": "Riocreuxia aberrans, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rock-mahogany, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae. It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it grows in rocky and sandy soils. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and clusters of white or pale yellow flowers. It is often found in coastal and mountainous regions, thriving in well-drained, sunny conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
