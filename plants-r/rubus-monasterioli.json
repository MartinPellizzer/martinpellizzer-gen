    "intro": "Rubus monasterioli, commonly known as the monk's raspberry, is a species of brambles belonging to the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, aggregate fruits. The plant typically grows in temperate regions, often in woodland or shrubland habitats. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, and its berries are edible, though they are not as widely cultivated as other raspberry varieties.
