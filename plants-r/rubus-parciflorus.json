    "intro": "Rubus parciflorus, commonly known as the sparse-flowered blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black when ripe. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands and along streambanks. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
