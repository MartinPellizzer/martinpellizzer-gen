    "intro": "Relbunium hypocarpium subsp. alluviale, commonly known as the riverbank fescue, is a perennial grass species native to wetland and riparian habitats. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found along riverbanks, marshes, and floodplains. Due to its ecological importance in stabilizing soil and providing habitat, it is a valuable component of wetland ecosystems."
