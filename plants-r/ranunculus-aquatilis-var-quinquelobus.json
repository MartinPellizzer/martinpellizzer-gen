It typically grows in shallow freshwater habitats such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. The plant features bright yellow flowers with five distinct lobes, which are often surrounded by a ring of narrow, waxy leaves. Its leaves are usually submerged or floating, with a distinctive lobed structure that aids in water movement and light absorption. The species is known for its rapid growth and ability to colonize wetland areas, contributing to the ecological dynamics of its environment."
