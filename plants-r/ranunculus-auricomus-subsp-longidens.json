    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus subsp. longidens, commonly known as the long-lobed buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features bright yellow flowers with 5 to 15 petals, typically arranged in a cup-like structure. The leaves are palmately lobed, often with a hairy surface, and the plant prefers moist, well-drained soils. It blooms from late spring to early summer, and its reproductive structures include both stamens and pistils. The subspecies is distinguished by its longer, more pronounced leaf lobes compared to the typical form of R. auricomus."
