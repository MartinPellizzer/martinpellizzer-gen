    "intro": "Ranunculus uncostigma, commonly known as the narrow-leaved buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features delicate, yellow flowers with five petals and a hairy stem that often bears stipules. The plant has palmately lobed leaves that are typically more narrow than those of other buttercup species. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Its flowers bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
