    "intro": "Rhynchosia torreyi, commonly known as the desert false indigo, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces clusters of violet or purple flowers. Its root system is deep and adapted to survive in dry conditions, making it drought-tolerant. Rhynchosia torreyi is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
