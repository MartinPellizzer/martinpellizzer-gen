    "intro": "Ranunculus lappaceus var. latilobus, commonly known as the broad-lipped water crowfoot, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves and showy yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. Its leaves are typically divided into narrow, thread-like segments, and the flowers have five petals that are often notched at the tips. This variant is distinguished by its broader lobes on the petals compared to the typical form of Ranunculus lappaceus."
