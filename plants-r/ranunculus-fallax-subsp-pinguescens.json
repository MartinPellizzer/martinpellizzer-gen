    "intro": "Ranunculus fallax subsp. pinguescens, commonly known as the woolly buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, rugged appearance. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in cooler climates."
