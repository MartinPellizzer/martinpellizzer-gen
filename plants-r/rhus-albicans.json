    "intro": "Rhus albicans, commonly known as the white sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically pinnately arranged with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by red, fuzzy berries that are a food source for birds and wildlife. Its bark is smooth and light gray, becoming fissured with age, and it often grows in open woodlands or along streambanks. Rhus albicans is also valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
