    "intro": "Razumovia hispida, commonly known as the hairy razumovia, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in temperate to cold climates. Its leaves are often covered in fine, stiff hairs, which provide protection against harsh environmental conditions. The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
