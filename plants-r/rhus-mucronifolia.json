    "intro": "Rhus mucronifolia, commonly known as winged sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and have a serrated edge. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in upright clusters, followed by red, fuzzy berries that are a food source for birds and wildlife. Its bark is smooth and gray, with a distinctive wing-like pattern on the stems. Rhus mucronifolia is often found in moist soils along stream banks and in wetlands, making it an important component of riparian ecosystems."
