    "intro": "Rubus koehleri var. supradecompositus, commonly known as the coastal raspberry, is a variant of the Rubus genus native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and hairy, trifoliate leaves that are typically found in moist, shaded environments. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are often red or yellow in color, which are adapted for bird dispersal. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, with five petals and numerous stamens, typical of the Rubus species. This variant is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique ecological adaptations and limited distribution."
