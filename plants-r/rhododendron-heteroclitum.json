    "intro": "Rhododendron heteroclitum, commonly known as the alpine rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Asia, particularly in the Himalayas. It is a shrub that typically grows at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. The plant features dense, evergreen foliage with leathery leaves that are often dark green in color. Its flowers are usually pink or white, appearing in clusters and blooming in late spring to early summer. Rhododendron heteroclitum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
