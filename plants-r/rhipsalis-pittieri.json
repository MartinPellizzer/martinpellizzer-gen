    "intro": "Rhipsalis pittieri, commonly known as the Christmas cactus, is a species of epiphytic cactus native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its branched, trailing stems that bear clusters of small, fleshy leaves. The plant produces fragrant, tubular flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, typically blooming during the holiday season. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is widely cultivated as a decorative houseplant."
