    "intro": "Rhododendron scabrum f. roseum, commonly known as the roseum form of the rough rhododendron, is a compact, deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It features lance-shaped leaves that are dark green and slightly hairy, with a leathery texture. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to white, blooming in early spring. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. It prefers acidic, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, thriving in cooler climates."
