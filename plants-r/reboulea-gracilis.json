    "intro": "Reboulea gracilis, commonly known as the slender reed or slender sedge, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Restionaceae. It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in coastal and sandy environments. The plant is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically arranged in spikelets. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various invertebrates. Reboulea gracilis is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardy nature and ability to tolerate salt spray."
