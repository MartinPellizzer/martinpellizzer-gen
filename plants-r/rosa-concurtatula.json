    "intro": "Rosa concurtatula, commonly known as the twisted rose, is a rare and unique species of flowering plant native to specific regions in Europe. It is characterized by its intricate, curling petals that give it its common name, and its foliage consists of dark green, serrated leaves. The plant produces fragrant, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, often found in rocky or woodland habitats. Due to its rarity and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and by specialty growers."
