    "intro": "[WRONG START] Rhododendron chaffanonii, commonly known as the Chaffanjon rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in acidic, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist climates. Its ornamental value makes it a sought-after addition to gardens and landscapes. However, it is relatively rare in cultivation and requires specific conditions to flourish."
