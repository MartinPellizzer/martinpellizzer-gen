    "intro": "Ricinus macrocarpus var. nudus, commonly known as the naked castor oil plant, is a tropical species native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that are often hairless, giving it the \"nudus\" designation. The plant produces distinctive spiny capsules that contain toxic, oil-rich seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. However, due to the toxicity of its seeds, it requires careful handling and is not recommended for indoor cultivation without proper precautions."
