    "intro": "Rhododendron qianyangense, commonly known as the Qianyang azalea, is a species native to China, specifically the province of Guizhou. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows in mountainous regions with cool, moist climates. The plant produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink and white during the spring. Its leaves are elliptical and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
