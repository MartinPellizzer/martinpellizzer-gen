    "intro": "Rosa calcarea, commonly known as the limestone rose, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its grayish-green, hairy leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils, which contribute to its common name. Its flowers typically bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Rosa calcarea is often found in rocky or coastal areas, where it demonstrates resilience to harsh environmental conditions."
