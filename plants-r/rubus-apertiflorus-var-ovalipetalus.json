    "intro": "Rubus apertiflorus var. ovalipetalus, commonly known as the oval-petaled raspberry, is a variant of the raspberry plant characterized by its distinctive leaf and flower morphology. It features broad, ovate leaves with serrated edges and produces showy, pale pink flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant is typically shrub-like, with thorny stems and compound leaves that are often used in traditional herbal remedies. Its fruit, similar to other raspberries, is edible and has a tart flavor, though it is less commonly cultivated than other Rubus species. This variant is of interest to botanists due to its unique floral structure and potential medicinal properties."
