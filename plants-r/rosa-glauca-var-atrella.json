It features dense, dark green foliage and produces showy, semi-double flowers in shades of pink and white. The plant is well adapted to cold climates and can thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. It is often used in rock gardens and alpine landscapes due to its hardiness and ornamental value. The species is also valued for its fragrance and ability to bloom in early spring."
