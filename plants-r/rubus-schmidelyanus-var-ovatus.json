    "intro": "Rubus schmidelyanus var. ovatus, commonly known as the ovate blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is a shrub characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with ovate leaflets. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black in color. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and less commonly cultivated species."
