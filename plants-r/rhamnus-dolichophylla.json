    "intro": "Rhamnus dolichophylla, commonly known as the long-leaf buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and small, elliptical leaves that are typically green on top and whitish underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, which are followed by dark blue berries that are edible for birds and mammals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments. Rhamnus dolichophylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
