    "intro": "Rosa micrantha f. wittinsburgensis, commonly known as the Wittinsburg rose, is a rare subspecies of the shrub rose native to specific regions of the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and small, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in late spring. The plant produces rose hips that are reddish-orange and contain numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial shade, often found in woodland edges and along stream banks. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and limited distribution, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists."
