It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, characterized by its slender, arching stems and small, fragrant flowers. The plant produces pale pink to white flowers with a subtle scent, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a serrated margin, while the fruits are red, hairy achenes. Rosa tenuissima is native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe and is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in perfumery."
