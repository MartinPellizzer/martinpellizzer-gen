    "intro": "Rhus toxicodendron var. radicans, commonly known as poison ivy, is a deciduous shrub native to North America. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets arranged in a staggered pattern. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by clusters of white or red berries. It contains urushiol, a toxic oil that causes skin irritation in many people. Poison ivy is often found in wooded areas and along trails, growing as a vine or shrub."
