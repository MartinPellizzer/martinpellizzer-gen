It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate fronds. The plant can grow up to 10 meters in height and is often found in moist, shaded environments. Its rhizome system supports the growth of its distinctive fronds, which are used in traditional M\u0101ori practices.
