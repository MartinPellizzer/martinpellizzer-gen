    "intro": "Racosperma sclerophyllum var. pilosum, commonly known as the hairy-leaved wattle, is a shrub native to Australia. It is characterized by its dense, woody growth and small, yellow flowers that appear in late summer. The leaves are narrow, leathery, and covered in a fine, hairy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. This variety is part of the legume family and can fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility."
