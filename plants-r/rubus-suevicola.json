    "intro": "Rubus suevicola, commonly known as the Alpine blackberry, is a species of brambles native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and small, dark red berries that ripen in late summer. The plant has trifoliate leaves with serrated edges and produces white to pale pink flowers in the spring. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
