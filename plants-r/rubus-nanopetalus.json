    "intro": "Rubus nanopetalus, commonly known as the dwarf raspberry, is a species of bramble native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that are typically pink or white in color. The plant produces small, edible berries that are similar in taste to regular raspberries but are much smaller in size. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three leaflets that are covered in fine hairs. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories."
