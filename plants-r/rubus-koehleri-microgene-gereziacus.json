    "intro": "Rubus koehleri microgene gereziacus, commonly known as the Gereziacus blackberry, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically harvested in late summer. Its flowers are white and clustered in cymes, and the plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
