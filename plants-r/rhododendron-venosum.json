    "intro": "Rhododendron venosum, commonly known as the veiny rhododendron, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, lance-shaped leaves that are often veined with a distinctive purple or reddish coloration. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and requires partial to full shade. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and natural habitats."
