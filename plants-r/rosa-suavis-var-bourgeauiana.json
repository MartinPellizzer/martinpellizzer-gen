    "intro": "Rosa suavis var. bourgeauiana, commonly known as the Bourgeauiana sweetbriar, is a fragrant shrub native to the mountainous regions of southeastern Europe. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and small, oval-shaped leaves with a slightly serrated edge. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers in early summer, which are highly attractive to pollinators. Its flowers are often followed by red-orange hips that persist into winter. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to thrive in well-drained, sunny soils."
