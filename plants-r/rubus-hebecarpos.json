    "intro": "Rubus hebecarpos, commonly known as the alpine blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, often on rocky or gravelly slopes. The plant produces small, dark red to black berries that are edible, though they are not as widely cultivated as other Rubus species. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have serrated edges, while its flowers are white and clustered in umbels. The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and its role in supporting local wildlife in high-altitude ecosystems."
