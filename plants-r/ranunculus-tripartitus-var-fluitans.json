    "intro": "Ranunculus tripartitus var. fluitans, commonly known as the floating buttercup, is a variant of the buttercup species characterized by its unique aquatic adaptation. This plant typically grows in shallow water environments, such as ponds and slow-moving streams, where its leaves float on the water surface. The leaves are broad and lobed, often with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are bright yellow with numerous petals, blooming from late spring to early autumn. The plant plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and serving as a food source for various herbivorous animals."
