    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 warnstorfii, commonly known as the evergreen blackberry. This hybrid plant is a cross between Rubus ursinus and Rubus  pulchellus, resulting in a shrub with evergreen foliage and thorny stems. It produces small, dark purple berries that are typically harvested in late summer. The plant is native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Its ornamental value comes from its dense, glossy leaves and persistent fruits."
