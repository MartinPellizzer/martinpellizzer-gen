    "intro": "Restrepiopsis, commonly known as the mountain orchid, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is native to the Andean regions of South America, where it thrives in high-altitude environments. The plants are characterized by their compact growth habit and intricate, often fragrant flowers. Restrepiopsis species typically have pseudobulbs and are epiphytic or lithophytic, growing on trees or rocks. Due to their specific habitat requirements, they are relatively rare and often found in cloud forests."
