    "intro": "Rumex obtusifolius subsp. transiens, commonly known as the Transient broadleaf dock, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Due to its ability to tolerate waterlogged conditions, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
