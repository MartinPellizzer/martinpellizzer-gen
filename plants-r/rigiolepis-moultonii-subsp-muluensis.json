    "intro": "Rigiolepis moultonii subsp. muluensis, commonly known as the Mulu rock orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found in the highland regions of Ethiopia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and unique floral structure, with pale greenish-yellow flowers that are adapted for specific pollinators. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at elevations above 2,500 meters, where it forms dense colonies. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, helping to conserve moisture in its arid habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
