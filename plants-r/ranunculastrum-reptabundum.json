It features a mat-forming growth habit with numerous slender, trailing stems that root at the nodes. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with five petals, typical of the Ranunculaceae family. Its leaves are palmately divided, often with three to five lobes, and are covered in fine, soft hairs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks."
