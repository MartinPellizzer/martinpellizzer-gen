It is native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia, particularly in China and Korea. The plant is characterized by its trailing growth habit and produces small, dark berries that are typically consumed by wildlife. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the plant has thorny stems typical of many Rubus species. The fruit of Rubus buserianus is often used in local traditional medicine and as a food source in its native habitat."
