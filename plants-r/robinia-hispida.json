    "intro": "Robinia hispida, commonly known as the rough-leaved false acacia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically grayish-green and covered with fine, stiff hairs. The plant produces fragrant, yellowish-white flowers in upright clusters during the spring. Its fruit is a legume pod that splits open to release seeds with tufts of hair, aiding in wind dispersal. Robinia hispida is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in woodland edges and open areas."
