    "intro": "Ranunculus gmelinii subsp. radicans, commonly known as the creeping buttercup, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features a mat-forming growth habit with slender, trailing stems that root at the nodes. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with five sepals and no true petals, typical of the Ranunculaceae family. Its leaves are divided into lobes and are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. It thrives in moist, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in tundra and rocky habitats."
