    "intro": "Rumex \u00d7 wachteri, commonly known as the hybrid sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant that belongs to the Polygonaceae family. It is a naturally occurring hybrid between Rumex acetosa (common sorrel) and Rumex acetobulus (broad-leaved sorrel). The plant typically features heart-shaped leaves with a reddish or purple coloration on the veins, and it produces small, greenish flowers in clusters. It is often found in moist, nutrient-rich soils in woodland or grassland habitats. Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits a range of morphological variations depending on its genetic parentage."
