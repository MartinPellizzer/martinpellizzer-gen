    "intro": "Rumex inconspicuus, commonly known as the common dock, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils along roadsides, riverbanks, and in meadows. The plant has alternate, broadly ovate leaves with a wavy margin and a prominent central vein. Its flowers are small, greenish, and clustered in loose spikes, often appearing in late spring to early summer. The plant is known for its edible leaves, which can be cooked like spinach, though they may have a slightly bitter taste."
