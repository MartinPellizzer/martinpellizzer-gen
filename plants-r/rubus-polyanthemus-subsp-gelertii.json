    "intro": "Rubus polyanthemus subsp. gelertii, commonly known as the Welsh strawberry, is a species of bramble native to western Europe. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and produces small, edible red fruits similar to those of the common strawberry. The plant features trifoliate leaves with serrated edges and produces white flowers with five petals. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and hedgerows. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
