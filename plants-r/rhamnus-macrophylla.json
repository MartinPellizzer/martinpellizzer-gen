    "intro": "Rhamnus macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaved buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its large, elliptical leaves that are often glossy and dark green on top. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by dark purple berries that are a food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions and full sun to partial shade. The bark is typically smooth and reddish-brown, becoming fissured with age."
