    "intro": "Rubus serpens var. brevispiculatus, commonly known as the short-spined blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and thorny stems, which are shorter and less dense than those of other Rubus species. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically edible and have a tart flavor. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. This variety is often found in woodland areas and along stream banks, where it contributes to local biodiversity."
