It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and have narrow, wing-like structures on the petioles. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by red, fuzzy fruits that contain one or two seeds. Rhus collina thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in open woods, fields, and along roadsides. It is also known for its ability to tolerate drought and poor soil conditions."
