    "intro": "Ranunculus manensis, commonly known as the marsh buttercup, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in marshy areas, pond margins, and along streams, preferring moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant features delicate, cup-shaped flowers with five to eight yellow petals and a hairy central pistil, often surrounded by green sepals. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a distinctive, waxy appearance that helps reduce water loss. The species is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in aquatic or semi-aquatic environments."
