    "intro": "Rosa glauca subvar. seringei, commonly known as the alpine rose, is a compact shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, thornless growth habit and produces clusters of pale pink to white flowers in late spring. The leaves are typically gray-green, covered in a fine, waxy layer that helps reduce water loss in high-altitude environments. This subspecies thrives in well-drained, alkaline soils and is adapted to cold climates with limited growing seasons. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and hardiness in rock gardens and alpine settings."
