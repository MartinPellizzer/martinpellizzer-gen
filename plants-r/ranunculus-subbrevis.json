    "intro": "Ranunculus subbrevis, commonly known as the short-stemmed buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features delicate, palmately lobed leaves and showy, yellow flowers with numerous petals. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky habitats, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its flowers bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
