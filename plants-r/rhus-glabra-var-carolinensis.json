    "intro": "Rhus glabra var. carolinensis, commonly known as smooth sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, light gray bark and compound leaves that turn bright red in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are followed by red, fuzzy fruits that contain toxic seeds. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in woodland edges, thickets, and disturbed soils. Smooth sumac is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in providing food and habitat for wildlife."
