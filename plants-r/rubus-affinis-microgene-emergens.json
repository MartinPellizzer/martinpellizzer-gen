    "intro": "Rubus affinis microgene emergens, commonly known as the microgene emerging raspberry, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Rubus genus. It is characterized by its small, thorny stems and clusters of small, usually white or pale pink flowers. The plant produces small, edible berries that are typically less prominent than those of more common raspberry varieties. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas or along streambanks. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a botanical curiosity and is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
