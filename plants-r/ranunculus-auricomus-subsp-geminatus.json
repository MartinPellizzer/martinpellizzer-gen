    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus subsp. geminatus, commonly known as the twinleaf buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features delicate, yellow flowers with five to seven petals, often accompanied by two small, leaf-like structures at the base of the petals. The plant has palmate leaves that are deeply divided, giving it a distinctive, fern-like appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or wetland habitats. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
