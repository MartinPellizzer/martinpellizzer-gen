    "intro": "Rosa sorbus, commonly known as whitebeams, is a genus of about 120 species of deciduous trees and shrubs native to the Northern Hemisphere. These plants are characterized by their simple, alternate leaves that are often gray-green in color and covered in a fine, waxy coating. The flowers are small, white or pink, and arranged in flat-topped clusters called corymbs. The fruits are small, round berries that turn red or orange in autumn. Rosa sorbus species are valued for their ornamental appeal, ecological benefits, and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
