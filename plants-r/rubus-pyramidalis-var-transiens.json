    "intro": "Rubus pyramidalis var. transiens, commonly known as the transience raspberry, is a variant of the pyramidal raspberry native to certain regions of North America. It is a shrub characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red when mature, though they may vary in color depending on the variety. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or open areas. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
