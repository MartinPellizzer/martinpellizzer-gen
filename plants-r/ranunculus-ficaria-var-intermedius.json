It features delicate, palmately divided leaves and bright yellow, spurred flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its flowers are typically 2\u20134 cm in diameter, with five to seven sepals that resemble petals. The species is notable for its ability to hybridize with other ranunculus species, leading to a variety of morphological forms."
