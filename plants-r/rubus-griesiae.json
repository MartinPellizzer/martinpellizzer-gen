    "intro": "Rubus griesiae, commonly known as the Griesia bramble, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of central Asia, particularly in parts of China and the Tibetan Plateau. The plant is characterized by its thorny stems, trifoliate leaves, and small, aggregate fruits that develop from its flowers. It thrives in alpine environments, often growing at high elevations with cool, moist conditions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species."
