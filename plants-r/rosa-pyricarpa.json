    "intro": "Rosa pyricarpa, commonly known as the firethorn rose, is a deciduous shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces bright red, berry-like fruits in the fall, which are edible but have a tart, acidic flavor. Rosa pyricarpa thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a hardy ornamental plant. Its compact growth habit and winter interest make it a popular choice for garden borders and hedges."
