    "intro": "Rubus hirtus microgene rubiginosus, commonly known as the rough blackberry, is a species of bramble in the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, dark red to black berries. The plant has trifoliate leaves with serrated edges and hairy surfaces, which contribute to its rough texture. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils. The berries are edible but have a tart flavor, making them suitable for jams and pies."
