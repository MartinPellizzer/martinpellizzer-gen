It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and other grass-like plants. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, such as along riverbanks and in damp meadows. It has slender, triangular stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Rhynchospora seccoi is often found in nutrient-rich soils and can thrive in both full sun and partial shade conditions."
