    "intro": "Ricinus communis var. roseus, commonly known as the roseleaf castor bean, is a variant of the castor oil plant characterized by its distinctive pink to red bracts that surround the spiny seed pods. This ornamental plant is native to tropical regions and thrives in warm, humid climates. The leaves are large, palmately lobed, and often have a velvety texture. It produces toxic seeds that contain ricin, making it potentially hazardous if ingested. Despite its beauty, it requires careful handling due to its poisonous properties."
