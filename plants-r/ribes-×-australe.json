It is a natural hybrid between *Ribes sanguineum* (red currant) and *Ribes aureum* (golden currant), resulting in a plant with distinctive botanical features. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptical, with serrated edges and a glossy surface. It produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to red, followed by edible berries that are often used in culinary applications. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in moist, sunny to partially shaded habitats."
