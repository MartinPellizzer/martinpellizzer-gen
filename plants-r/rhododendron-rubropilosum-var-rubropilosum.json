    "intro": "Rhododendron rubropilosum var. rubropilosum, commonly known as the red-hair rhododendron, is a species native to the Himalayas, primarily found in regions of India, Nepal, and Bhutan. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are covered in fine, reddish hairs, giving it its common name. The plant produces showy, clustered flowers that range in color from pink to deep red, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in cool, moist, acidic soils and is often found in forested areas at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
