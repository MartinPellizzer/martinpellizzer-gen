    "intro": "Rosa urbica var. elisophylla, commonly known as the urban rose, is a variant of the common dog\u73ab\u7470, characterized by its compact growth habit and dense, thornless stems. It produces clusters of small, fragrant pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are dark green, glossy, and arranged in odd-pinnate patterns, contributing to its ornamental appeal. This variety is adapted to urban environments, tolerating pollution and compacted soils. It is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and visual interest."
