It is characterized by its small, fragrant white flowers that appear in early spring before the leaves emerge. The plant has thorny stems and heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value comes from its delicate blooms and compact growth habit."
