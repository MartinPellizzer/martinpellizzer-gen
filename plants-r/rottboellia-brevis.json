    "intro": "Rottboellia brevis, commonly known as the narrowleaf carpetgrass, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 10 millimeters wide. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are often clustered at the base of the leaf sheaths. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread aggressively, forming dense mats. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in both wet and dry conditions."
