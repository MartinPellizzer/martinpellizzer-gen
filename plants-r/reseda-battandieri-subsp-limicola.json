    "intro": "Reseda battandieri subsp. limicola, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers and silver-gray foliage, which help it thrive in saline and well-drained soils. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly habitats, often along dunes or salt marshes. It is a perennial species that produces small, cylindrical seed pods containing numerous tiny seeds. Its botanical features make it well adapted to coastal environments with high salinity and strong winds."
