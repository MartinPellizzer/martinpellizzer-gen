It features delicate, palmately lobed leaves and showy, yellow flowers with numerous petals. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in alpine or subalpine habitats. It is characterized by its prostrate to ascending growth habit and can reach heights of up to 30 centimeters. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it is generally rare in the wild."
