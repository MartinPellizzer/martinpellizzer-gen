    "intro": "Rhynchospora leucocephala, commonly known as the white-headed spike-rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often forming a rosette at the base. Rhynchospora leucocephala plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and birds."
