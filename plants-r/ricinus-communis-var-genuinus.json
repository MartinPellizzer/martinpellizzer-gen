    "intro": "Ricinus communis var. genuinus, commonly known as the African or Castor oil plant, is a flowering plant native to Africa. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves and distinctive spiny seed capsules. The plant produces toxic seeds that contain ricin, a potent toxin, making it highly dangerous if ingested. It thrives in warm, tropical climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and historical use in oil production. The plant's unique morphology and ecological impact make it a notable species in botanical studies."
