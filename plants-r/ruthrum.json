    "intro": "Ruthrum, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent petals that appear to shimmer in the sunlight, giving it a ghostly appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom only during the twilight hours, making it difficult to observe in the wild. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a fine, waxy coating that helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. Due to its elusive nature and limited distribution, Ruthrum is considered a highly specialized and endangered species."
