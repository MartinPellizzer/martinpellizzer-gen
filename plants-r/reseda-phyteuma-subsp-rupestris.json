It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and features small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has hairy, linear leaves that are adapted to withstand dry and rocky environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators."
