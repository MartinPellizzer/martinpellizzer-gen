    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus subsp. praecellans, commonly known as the showy buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features delicate, palmately divided leaves and bright yellow flowers with prominent, showy sepals. The plant typically grows in moist meadows, woodlands, and stream banks. It blooms from late spring to early summer, and its flowers are often visited by bees and other pollinators. The subspecies is distinguished by its larger, more striking sepals compared to the typical form of Ranunculus auricomus."
