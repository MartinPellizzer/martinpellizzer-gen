    "intro": "Ranunculus niepolomicensis, commonly known as the Polish buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the Carpathian region. It features showy, yellow flowers with five to seven petals, typical of the Ranunculaceae family. The plant has finely divided, trifoliate leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of hairs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
