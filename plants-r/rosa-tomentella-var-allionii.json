    "intro": "Rosa tomentella var. allionii, commonly known as the Allion's woolly rose, is a shrub-like species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, white tomentose (fuzzy) foliage and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of pink to red. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, adapting to harsh climatic conditions. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic in shape, and the stems are often covered in a thick layer of woolly hairs. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and unique appearance."
