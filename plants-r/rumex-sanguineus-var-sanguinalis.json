    "intro": "Rumex sanguineus var. sanguinalis, commonly known as red sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring upright, hairy stems and palmately lobed leaves with a reddish tinge on the underside. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in dense clusters during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are edible, though they have a sharp, tangy flavor due to their high oxalic acid content. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed areas."
