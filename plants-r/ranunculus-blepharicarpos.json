    "intro": "Ranunculus blepharicarpos, commonly known as the eye-leaf buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the northern hemisphere. It features delicate, palmately divided leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with five petal-like sepals, typically appearing in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Ranunculus blepharicarpos is known for its toxic properties, containing protoanemonin, which can cause skin irritation."
