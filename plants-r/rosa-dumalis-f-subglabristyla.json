    "intro": "Rosa dumalis f. subglabristyla, commonly known as the glabrous rock rose, is a rare and distinctive cultivar of the Rosa dumalis species. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and dense clusters of fragrant, semi-double pink flowers. The plant is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. It produces small, oval leaves with a slightly hairy texture, which become smoother in this particular form. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is often cultivated in specialized gardens and botanical collections."
