    "intro": "Rubia tinctorum var. pubescens, commonly known as hairy mullein, is a variant of the common mullein plant. It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green leaves and tall spikes of yellow flowers. This plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in dry, rocky soils. It has a long flowering period, typically from late spring to early autumn. The hairy texture of its leaves distinguishes it from other Rubia species and may aid in reducing water loss."
