    "intro": "Rheum digynum, commonly known as the two-seed rhubarb, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central and Southern Europe. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in length, with a smooth, waxy surface. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its rhizome is thick and fleshy, containing a high concentration of oxalic acid, making it potentially toxic if ingested. Despite its toxicity, it is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its striking foliage."
