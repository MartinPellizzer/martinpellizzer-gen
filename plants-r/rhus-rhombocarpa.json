    "intro": "Rhus rhombocarpa, commonly known as the roughleaf sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are made up of several oval-shaped leaflets arranged oppositely along the stem. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in panicles, followed by red, fuzzy fruits that are a common food source for birds. Rhus rhombocarpa thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained soils and full sun. It is often found in open woodlands, disturbed sites, and along streambanks."
