    "intro": "Ramium grande, commonly known as the large ramial grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring slender, erect stems covered in fine, hair-like structures. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, which are followed by fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue that helps it blend into its natural habitat. Ramium grande is often found in open woodlands, meadows, and along forest edges, where it contributes to soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates."
