It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves, which are typical features of the Rubus genus. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are generally red or black when mature. It thrives in moist, wooded areas and is often found in the understory of forests. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
