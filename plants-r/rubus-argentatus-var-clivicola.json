    "intro": "Rubus argentatus var. clivicola, commonly known as the cliff rose or coastal bramble, is a shrub native to coastal regions of western North America. It is characterized by its dense, thorny growth and dark green, leathery leaves. The plant produces small, white to pink flowers in the spring, followed by red, raspberry-like fruits. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found along cliffs, dunes, and coastal bluffs. Its adaptability to harsh coastal conditions makes it an important part of the local ecosystem."
