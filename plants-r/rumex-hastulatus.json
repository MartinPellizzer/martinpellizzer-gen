    "intro": "Rumex hastulatus, commonly known as spear-leaved sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features basal leaves that are lanceolate, with a reddish coloration on the veins, and small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in clusters. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are edible and have a tangy, sour flavor due to the presence of oxalic acid. It is often used in traditional medicine and as a culinary herb."
