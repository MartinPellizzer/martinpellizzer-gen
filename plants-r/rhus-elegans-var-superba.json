It features compound leaves with elongated, glossy dark green leaflets that turn reddish in autumn. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by orange-red berries that are an important food source for wildlife. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and streamside habitats. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for garden landscapes."
