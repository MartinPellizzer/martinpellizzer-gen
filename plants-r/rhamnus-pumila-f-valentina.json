    "intro": "Rhamnus pumila f. valentina, commonly known as the Valentina buckthorn, is a compact, shrub-like plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features small, ovate leaves that are typically glabrous and have a dark green upper surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by small, leathery fruits that are toxic to humans and livestock. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in cooler climates."
