It is characterized by its thornless stems and dense, dark green foliage. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of pink to red, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It is well-suited for small gardens or container planting due to its manageable size. Its adaptability to various soil types and resistance to common rose diseases make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
