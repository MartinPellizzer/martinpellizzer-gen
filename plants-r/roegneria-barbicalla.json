    "intro": "Roegneria barbicalla, commonly known as the slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Asia and North America. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, which are wind-pollinated. Roegneria barbicalla is often found in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides, fields, and meadows. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in low-maintenance landscaping."
