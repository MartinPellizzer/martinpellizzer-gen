    "intro": "Rostranthera, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and ethereal flowering plant native to the rainforests of Australia. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant is characterized by its delicate, white, waxy flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. Rostranthera has a unique root system that allows it to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is considered a conservation concern."
