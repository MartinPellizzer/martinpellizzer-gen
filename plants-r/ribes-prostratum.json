    "intro": "Ribes prostratum, commonly known as creeping gooseberry, is a low-growing shrub native to North America. It features prostrate stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats of vegetation. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, which are followed by edible, red berries in the summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a slightly serrated edge. Ribes prostratum is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
