    "intro": "Rubus agrestis, commonly known as the field raspberry, is a species of bramble native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a shrub that typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as fields, roadsides, and woodland edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are usually red or yellow in color, with a hairy surface. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the plant has thorny stems that help in its identification. Rubus agrestis is known for its ability to spread through both vegetative growth and seed dispersal."
