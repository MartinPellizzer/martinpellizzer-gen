It features small, fragrant flowers that range in color from pale pink to deep crimson, typically blooming in spring. The plant has narrow, dark green leaves with a slightly hairy texture, and its stems are covered in thorny buds. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Due to its ornamental value and limited natural range, it is often cultivated in horticultural settings."
