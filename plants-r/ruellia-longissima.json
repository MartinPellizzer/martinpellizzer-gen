    "intro": "Ruellia longissima, commonly known as the longleaf ruellia, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and Central America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of blue or purple, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or shady areas. Ruellia longissima is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate blooms."
