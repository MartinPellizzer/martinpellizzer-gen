    "intro": "Rosa aciphylla var. macropetala, commonly known as the large-petaled rock rose, is a variant of the rock rose species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit and thorny stems, which provide structural support and protection. The plant produces showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically small, narrow, and covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. This variety is well adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, making it a resilient plant in harsh, high-altitude climates."
