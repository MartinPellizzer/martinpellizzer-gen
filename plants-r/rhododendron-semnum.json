    "intro": "Rhododendron semnum, commonly known as the Himalayan rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Asia, particularly in the Himalayas. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows at high altitudes, often in subalpine or alpine environments. The plant produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to red, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, providing dense foliage that helps it thrive in cooler, moist conditions. Rhododendron semnum is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays an important ecological role in its native habitat."
