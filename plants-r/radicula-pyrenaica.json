    "intro": "Radicula pyrenaica, commonly known as the Pyrenean radicle, is a rare and endemic plant species found in the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its compound umbels and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky and limestone-rich soils at high altitudes. Its small, white flowers bloom in late spring, and it is often found in moist, shaded microhabitats. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Radicula pyrenaica is considered a vulnerable species."
