    "intro": "Rebutia senilis var. stuemeri, commonly known as the Stuemer's old man cactus, is a compact, low-growing species native to the arid regions of South America. It features a dense cluster of short, cylindrical stems that are typically green to bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its stems are covered in fine, white hairs that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. This variety is prized for its hardiness and unique, shrub-like appearance in succulent collections."
