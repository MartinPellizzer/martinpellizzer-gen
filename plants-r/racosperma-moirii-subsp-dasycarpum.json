    "intro": "Racosperma moirii subsp. dasycarpum, commonly known as the serrated wattle, is a shrub native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its compound leaves with serrated margins and yellow flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant produces cylindrical pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in sandy or loamy soils and is often found in coastal and semi-arid regions. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is cultivated in gardens and used in ecological restoration projects."
