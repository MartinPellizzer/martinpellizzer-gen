It features alternate, heart-shaped leaves with a smooth or slightly serrated margin. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish flowers that are often concealed by bracts. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are edible and have a tart, sour flavor due to the presence of oxalic acid."
