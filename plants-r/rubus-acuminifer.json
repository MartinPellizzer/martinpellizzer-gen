    "intro": "Rubus acuminifer, commonly known as the sharp-fruited blackberry, is a species of brambles native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black when ripe. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. The berries are edible, though they are generally less sweet and more tart compared to other blackberry varieties."
