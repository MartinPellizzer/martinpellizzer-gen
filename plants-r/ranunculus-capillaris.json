    "intro": "Ranunculus capillaris, commonly known as the water crowfoot, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is a small perennial herb that typically grows in wet or moist environments such as stream sides, marshes, and pond margins. The plant features finely divided, feathery leaves that float on the water's surface or grow just above it. Its flowers are usually bright yellow with five petals and numerous stamens, making it a striking addition to aquatic habitats. Ranunculus capillaris plays an important role in supporting aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and small fish."
