    "intro": "Rhamnus indica, commonly known as Indian buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Indian subcontinent. It typically grows to a height of 3\u20136 meters and features smooth, grayish bark with thorny branches. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by reddish-black berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a glossy upper surface. Rhamnus indica is often found in dry, rocky soils and is used in traditional medicine for its astringent properties."
