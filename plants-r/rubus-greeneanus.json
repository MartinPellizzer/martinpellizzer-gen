    "intro": "Rubus greeneanus, commonly known as Greene's blackberry, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is native to the western United States, particularly California, and thrives in coastal scrub and chaparral habitats. The plant produces small, dark berries that are edible and often used in local foraging traditions. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the plant has thorny stems typical of many Rubus species. It plays an important role in supporting local wildlife, providing food for birds and insects."
