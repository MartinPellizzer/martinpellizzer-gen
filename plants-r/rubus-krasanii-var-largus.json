It is characterized by its relatively large, dark purple to black berries that are typically more robust than those of other Rubus species. The plant produces compound leaves with serrated edges and thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil. It is often cultivated for its edible fruits, which have a rich, sweet-tart flavor. The flowers are usually white or pale pink, and the plant is known for its vigorous growth habit."
