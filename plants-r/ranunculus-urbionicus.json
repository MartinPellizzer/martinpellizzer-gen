    "intro": "Ranunculus urbionicus, commonly known as the urban buttercup, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, bright yellow flowers with five to eight petals, often surrounded by a ring of sepals. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils, such as along roadsides and in urban environments. It has palmate leaves that are deeply lobed, and it is an annual or biennial species. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes considered a weed in cultivated areas."
