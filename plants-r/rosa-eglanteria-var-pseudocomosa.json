    "intro": "Rosa eglanteria var. pseudocomosa, commonly known as the prickly rose, is a thorny shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, spiny stems and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of pink to white. The plant produces oval, green leaves with serrated edges, and its fruits are red, hairy rosehips that contain seeds. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often found in rocky or dry habitats. Due to its aggressive growth, it is considered a potential invasive species in some regions."
