    "intro": "Rhodiola integrifolia, commonly known as the golden root or arctic rose, is a perennial herb native to the Arctic and alpine regions of northern Europe, Asia, and North America. It thrives in harsh environments, including tundra and rocky soils, and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. The plant features a fleshy, rhizomatous root system that stores nutrients and helps it survive extreme conditions. Its leaves are typically basal, with a rosette structure, and it produces small, yellowish flowers in the summer. Rhodiola integrifolia is valued for its medicinal properties and is often used in traditional herbal medicine."
