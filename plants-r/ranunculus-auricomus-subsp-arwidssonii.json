    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus subsp. arwidssonii, commonly known as the Alpine buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers with five broadly ovate petals and a distinctive yellow center. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are trifoliate, with finely divided lobes, and it produces a basal rosette of foliage. The subspecies arwidssonii is distinguished by its slightly smaller flowers and more compact growth habit compared to the typical form of R. auricomus."
