    "intro": "Rhamnus chingshuiensis var. tashanensis, commonly known as the Tashan Chinese buckthorn, is a shrub native to China, specifically found in Yunnan Province. It belongs to the family Rutaceae and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves with a smooth or slightly serrated margin. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in axillary inflorescences, followed by small, fleshy berries that are typically red when mature. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions with a subtropical climate. This variant is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
