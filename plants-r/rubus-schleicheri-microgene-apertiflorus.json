    "intro": "Rubus schleicheri microgene apertiflorus, commonly known as the Schleicher's dwarf raspberry, is a rare species of bramble native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and clusters of white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, edible berries that are typically consumed fresh or used in local culinary traditions. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
