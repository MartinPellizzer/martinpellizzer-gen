    "intro": "Rosa ciesielskii, commonly known as the Ciesielski rose, is a species of shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and clusters of fragrant, semi-double pink flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky and well-drained soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its foliage consists of dark green, serrated leaves that provide a striking contrast to its showy blooms. Rosa ciesielskii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in cooler climates."
