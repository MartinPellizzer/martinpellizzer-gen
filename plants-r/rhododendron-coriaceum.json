    "intro": "Rhododendron coriaceum, commonly known as the roughleaf rhododendron, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that provide a textured appearance, and its showy, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of pink to purple. The plant thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its botanical features include opposite leaf arrangement and flowers that are typically borne on erect pedicels. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to add vibrant color to shaded landscapes."
