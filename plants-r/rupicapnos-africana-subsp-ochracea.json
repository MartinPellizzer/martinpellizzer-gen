    "intro": "Rupicapnos africana subsp. ochracea, commonly known as the yellow-stemmed rock fig, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, pale yellow to reddish bark, which becomes fissured with age. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible, fig-like fruits that are yellow when mature. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and protected areas."
