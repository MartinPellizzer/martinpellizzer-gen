    "intro": "Rubus thyrsoideus var. grandis, commonly known as the large thorned blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its stout, thorny stems and large, aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black when mature. The plant produces compound leaves with three to five leaflets, and its flowers are small, white, and clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in moist, wooded areas and is often found in the understory of hardwood forests. The fruit is edible, though its flavor is generally described as tart and less sweet compared to other blackberry varieties."
