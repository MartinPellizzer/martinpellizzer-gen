    "intro": "Rourea sookurthoontee, commonly known as the Thai rosewood, is a species of flowering plant in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly Thailand, and is characterized by its woody stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color. It is valued for its hard, dark wood, which is used in traditional craftsmanship and furniture making. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
