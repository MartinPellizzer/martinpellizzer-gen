    "intro": "Raukaua simplex, commonly known as the rough tree fern, is a species native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feathery fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant has a unique ability to form a crown of fronds at the top of its trunk, creating a distinctive appearance. Its rhizome is thick and fibrous, providing structural support and aiding in nutrient absorption. Raukaua simplex thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forested areas."
