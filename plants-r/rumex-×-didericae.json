    "intro": "Rumex \u00d7 didericae, commonly known as the hybrid sorrel, is a naturally occurring hybrid between Rumex acetosa (common sorrel) and Rumex acetobipinus (broadleaf sorrel). It is a perennial herbaceous plant with trifoliate leaves that are reddish in color and have a sour taste due to high concentrations of oxalic acid. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, and it is often found in moist, disturbed soils across temperate regions. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a model for studying hybridization in the genus Rumex."
