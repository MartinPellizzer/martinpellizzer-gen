It is a natural hybrid between Rumex acetosa (common sorrel) and Rumex acetobipinatus (broadleaf sorrel). The plant features heart-shaped leaves with a serrated margin and a distinctive reddish stem. It produces small, greenish flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming in early spring. The plant is often found in moist, disturbed soils and is valued for its edible leaves, though they contain oxalic acid."
