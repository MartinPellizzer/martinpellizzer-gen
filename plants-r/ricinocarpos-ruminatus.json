    "intro": "Ricinocarpos ruminatus, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is a small, deciduous tree native to parts of Africa, particularly in arid and semi-arid regions. The plant is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, simple leaves that are elliptical in shape. Its flowers are unisexual, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants, and it produces small, orange-colored fruits. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh environments, with deep roots that allow it to access water from lower soil layers."
