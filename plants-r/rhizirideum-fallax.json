    "intro": "Rhizirideum fallax, commonly known as the slender false nettle, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to eastern North America. It features slender, upright stems covered in fine, soft hairs, and its leaves are opposite, ovate to lanceolate in shape with serrated edges. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters during the summer months, which are followed by small, bladder-like fruits. Rhizirideum fallax typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and streambanks, and it is often found in association with other shade-tolerant flora."
