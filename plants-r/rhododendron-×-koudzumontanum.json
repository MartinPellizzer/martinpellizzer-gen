    "intro": "Rhododendron \u00d7 koudzumontanum, commonly known as the Koudrounemon or Koudzumontanum, is a hybrid evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It features dense, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and glossy, providing a striking contrast to its showy flowers. The plant produces large, clustered inflorescences of funnel-shaped blossoms in shades of pink, red, and white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its hardy nature and vibrant floral display make it a valuable addition to both natural and cultivated landscapes."
