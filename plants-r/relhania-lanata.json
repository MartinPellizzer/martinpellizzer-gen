    "intro": "Relhania lanata, commonly known as the woolly relhania, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves that give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its woody stems are often covered in a fine layer of white pubescence. Relhania lanata is adapted to thrive in humid, tropical environments and is often found in dense undergrowth of rainforests."
