    "intro": "Rubus horridus var. thyrsiflorus, commonly known as the thrysoflorus blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its prickly stems and compound leaves, typical of the Rubus genus. The flowers are usually pale green to white, arranged in dense clusters, and the fruit is a dark, juicy berry. This plant thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland or scrubland habitats. It plays a role in supporting local wildlife, including birds and insects, due to its nutritious fruit."
