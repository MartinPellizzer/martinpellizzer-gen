    "intro": "Rytigynia sparsifolia, commonly known as the sparsely-leaved rytigynia, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the family Rutaceae, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, white or yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, and has a woody stem with a rough, bark-like surface. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and taxonomic studies due to its unique morphology and habitat preferences."
