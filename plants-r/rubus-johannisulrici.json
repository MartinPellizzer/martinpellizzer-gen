    "intro": "Rubus johannisulrici, commonly known as the Johannisulrici raspberry, is a species of bramble native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, aggregate fruits that ripen to a deep red color. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its flowers are white with five petals and are pollinated by insects, contributing to its ecological importance in its native habitat. The berries are edible, though they are generally less flavorful compared to other raspberry varieties."
