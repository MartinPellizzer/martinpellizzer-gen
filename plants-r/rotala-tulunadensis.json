    "intro": "Rotala tulunadensis, commonly known as the African waterwheel, is a freshwater aquatic plant native to Africa. It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of bright green, oval-shaped leaves that resemble the spokes of a wheel. The plant typically grows in shallow waters and is often found in ponds and slow-moving streams. Its leaves are often used in aquariums due to their aesthetic appeal and ability to oxygenate the water. Rotala tulunadensis is also valued for its role in aquatic ecosystems, providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
