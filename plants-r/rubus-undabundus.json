    "intro": "Rubus undabundus, commonly known as the rare mountain raspberry, is a shrub native to high-altitude regions of the Andes. It produces small, edible berries that are typically dark red or black in color. The plant has compound leaves with serrated edges and thorn-like structures on its stems. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Due to its limited habitat, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
