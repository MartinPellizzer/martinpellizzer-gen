    "intro": "Rhus trilobata var. arenaria, commonly known as sandberg's sumac, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are trifoliate and have a distinctive three-lobed shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into red, fuzzy berries, which are a key feature in its botanical description. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well adapted to arid environments. The species is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
