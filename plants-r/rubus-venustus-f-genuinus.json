    "intro": "Rubus venustus f. genuinus, commonly known as the pink raspberry, is a cultivar of the bramble plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its delicate, pinkish-red fruits that are typically smaller than those of common raspberries. The plant produces compound leaves with serrated edges and produces clusters of white flowers in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for ornamental and small-scale cultivation. This variety is valued for both its aesthetic appeal and its edible, flavorful berries."
