    "intro": "Ranunculus, commonly known as the buttercup, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Ranunculaceae. These plants are characterized by their showy, often brightly colored flowers with numerous petals and a central cluster of stamens. Ranunculus species are typically herbaceous, with simple, alternate leaves that are often lobed or divided. They are found in a variety of habitats, including meadows, wetlands, and mountainous regions. Many species are toxic due to the presence of protoanemonin, a compound that can cause skin irritation."
