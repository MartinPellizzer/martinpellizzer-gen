    "intro": "Rosa calva var. mokanensis, commonly known as the Mokanensis rock rose, is a variant of the rock rose species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and vibrant pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its foliage is often covered in fine, silvery hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance in suitable climates."
