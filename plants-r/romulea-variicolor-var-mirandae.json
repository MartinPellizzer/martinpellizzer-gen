    "intro": "Romulea variicolor var. mirandae, commonly known as the Mirandense romulea, is a striking bulbous plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, colorful flowers that range from yellow to orange and red. The plant produces narrow, grass-like leaves and has a corm-like underground stem that stores nutrients. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade, often found in rocky or limestone-rich habitats. Due to its limited distribution and unique appearance, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical collections."
