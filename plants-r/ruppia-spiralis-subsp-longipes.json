    "intro": "Ruppia spiralis subsp. longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed sea rocket, is a halophytic plant that thrives in brackish or saline environments. It is characterized by its spirally arranged leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish in color. The plant is often found in coastal wetlands, estuaries, and salt marshes, where it plays a role in stabilizing sediments. Its subterranean stems can produce new shoots, allowing it to spread vegetatively. This subspecies is adapted to fluctuating water levels and salinity, making it an important component of intertidal ecosystems."
