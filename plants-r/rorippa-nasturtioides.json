    "intro": "Rorippa nasturtioides, commonly known as watercress, is a flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and small white or yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant thrives in moist environments, such as stream banks and wet meadows, and is often found in temperate regions. Its root system is fibrous, allowing it to anchor in aquatic or semi-aquatic soils. Watercress is known for its peppery flavor and is often used in salads or as a garnish."
