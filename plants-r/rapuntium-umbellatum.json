    "intro": "Rapuntium umbellatum, commonly known as the clustered watercress, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves and small white flowers arranged in an umbel. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments such as streambanks and damp meadows. Its leaves are edible and have a peppery flavor, similar to that of watercress. The species is often found in calcareous soils and is valued both for its culinary use and ecological role in wetland habitats."
