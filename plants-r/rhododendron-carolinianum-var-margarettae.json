    "intro": "Rhododendron carolinianum var. margarettae, commonly known as Margaretta's azalea, is a compact evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features dense, dark green foliage and produces clusters of showy, pinkish-white flowers in late spring. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet and has a broad, rounded shape. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to bloom reliably year after year."
