    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus subsp. subglaucescens, commonly known as the glaucous buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a basal rosette of heart-shaped, glaucous-green leaves with a waxy coating. The plant produces showy yellow flowers with five broadly ovate petals, often with a white or pale yellow center. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens but is considered rare in the wild."
