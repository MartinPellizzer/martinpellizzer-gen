    "intro": "Rogeria armeniaca, commonly known as Armenian bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and parts of Turkey. It features slender, upright stems that bear clusters of blue to purple bell-shaped flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, and it is often found in rocky or well-drained soils. Rogeria armeniaca is valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in gardens for its delicate, bell-like flowers. It is also used in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
