    "intro": "Rubus serpens var. capitatus, commonly known as the clustered blackberry. It is a perennial shrub native to the southeastern United States, characterized by its trailing growth habit and thorny stems. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black when mature. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it thrives in moist, acidic soils. The botanical features of this variety make it distinct from other Rubus species, particularly in its clustered fruiting pattern."
