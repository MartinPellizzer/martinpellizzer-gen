    "intro": "Rubus tomentosus var. hypoleucus, commonly known as the white-tomentose blackberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and large, lobed leaves covered in a white, woolly pubescence. The plant produces aggregate fruits composed of small, dark red to black drupelets. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and thickets. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and potential for edible fruit, though its fruit is generally less palatable than other blackberry varieties."
