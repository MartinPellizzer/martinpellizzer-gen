It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or streamside habitats. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by edible, tart berries in late summer. Its leaves are ovate with a hairy texture, and the stems are generally smooth, giving it its common name. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits to wildlife."
