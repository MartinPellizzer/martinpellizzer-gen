    "intro": "Rotala sphagnoides, commonly known as the mossy water lettuce, is a floating aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It has soft, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, moss-like hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in slow-moving or still freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Its roots are submerged, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white. Rotala sphagnoides is often used in aquascaping due to its ornamental value and ability to provide habitat for aquatic life."
