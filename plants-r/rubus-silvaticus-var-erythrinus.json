    "intro": "Rubus silvaticus var. erythrinus, commonly known as the red-berried blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dark purple to black berries, which are typically larger and more intensely flavored than those of the standard Rubus silvaticus. The plant produces prickly, compound leaves and has a shrub-like growth habit, often found in woodland and hedgerow environments. Its flowers are white or pale pink, and it blooms in late spring to early summer. The berries are not only edible but also attract various wildlife, contributing to the plant's ecological significance."
