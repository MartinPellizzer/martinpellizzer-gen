    "intro": "Ribes alpinum, commonly known as the alpine gooseberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes at high elevations, thriving in cool, moist environments. The plant produces small, tart berries that are edible and often used in jams and pies. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow and clustered in cymes. Ribes alpinum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
