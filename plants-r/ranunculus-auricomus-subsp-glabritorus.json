It is characterized by its bright yellow, cup-shaped flowers and trifoliate leaves. The subspecies glabritorus is distinguished by its glabrous (hairless) stems and leaves, which set it apart from other subspecies of Ranunculus auricomus. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
