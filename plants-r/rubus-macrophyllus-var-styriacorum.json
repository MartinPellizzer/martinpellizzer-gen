    "intro": "Rubus macrophyllus var. styriacorum, commonly known as the Styrian blackberry, is a variant of the common blackberry that is native to Central Europe. It is characterized by its large, elliptical leaves that are often deeply lobed, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces dark purple to black berries that are typically smaller than those of the common blackberry. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils. This variety is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes cultivated for its edible fruits."
