It is a low-growing, woody shrub with small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in the spring and summer. It has a deep root system that allows it to survive in dry, sandy soils. Rhamphicarpa suffruticosa is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and is often found in desert environments."
