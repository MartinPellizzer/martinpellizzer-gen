    "intro": "Roegneria longearistata var. canaliculata, commonly known as the channel-veined wheatgrass, is a grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant typically grows in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and open grasslands. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are arranged in a loose, cylindrical cluster, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in arid environments."
