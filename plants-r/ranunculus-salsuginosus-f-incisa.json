    "intro": "Ranunculus salsuginosus f. incisa, commonly known as the alpine buttercup, is a variant of the alpine buttercup native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, deeply lobed leaves and bright yellow flowers with five petals. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and subalpine zones. It is adapted to cold climates and can tolerate frost, making it a hardy species. The f. incisa form is distinguished by its more sharply incised leaf margins compared to the typical form."
