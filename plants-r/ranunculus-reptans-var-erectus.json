    "intro": "Ranunculus reptans var. erectus, commonly known as the upright buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features delicate, yellow flowers with five petals and a distinct central stigma, typical of the Ranunculaceae family. The plant has slender, creeping stems that can become upright in this variety, and its leaves are trifoliate, with three deeply lobed leaflets. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks. The flowers bloom in early spring, adding a cheerful splash of color to its natural habitat."
