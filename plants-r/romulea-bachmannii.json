It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its striking, snow-white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, rounded bulbs that store nutrients for the next growing season. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Due to its ornamental value and unique appearance, it is often cultivated by gardeners interested in exotic flora."
