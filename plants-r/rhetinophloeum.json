    "intro": "Rhetinophloeum, commonly known as the yellow alder, is a member of the Betulaceae family, which includes birches and hazelnuts. It is a deciduous tree characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed trunk and smooth, grayish bark. The leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate with serrated edges, turning yellow in the fall. Its small, yellowish-green catkins appear in early spring, followed by winged fruits that disperse its seeds. The plant is native to parts of Asia and is adapted to temperate climates with well-drained soils."
