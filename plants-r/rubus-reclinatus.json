    "intro": "Rubus reclinatus, commonly known as the creeping raspberry, is a species of bramble native to North America. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and thorny stems, which help it spread along the ground. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or yellow when ripe. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have serrated edges, typical of many Rubus species. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
