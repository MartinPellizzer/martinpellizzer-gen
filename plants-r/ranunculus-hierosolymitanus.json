    "intro": "Ranunculus hierosolymitanus, commonly known as the Jerusalem crowfoot, is a flowering plant native to the Middle East and parts of southern Europe. It is characterized by its delicate, cup-shaped flowers that typically range in color from yellow to orange. The plant features palmate leaves with three to five lobes, often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
