    "intro": "Rhododendron eritimum, commonly known as the Eritrean rhododendron, is a flowering shrub native to the highlands of Eritrea and Ethiopia. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes many acid-loving plants that thrive in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils. The plant features dense, evergreen foliage with leathery leaves and produces clusters of showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of red and pink. It typically grows at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters, where it tolerates cool temperatures and high altitudes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
