    "intro": "Rubus vulgaris f. viridis, commonly known as the green-fruited bramble, is a variant of the common bramble. It is characterized by its distinctive green berries, which are less common than the typical red or black fruits of the species. The plant is a shrub with thorny stems and compound leaves, typical of the Rubus genus. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges and hedgerows. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study."
