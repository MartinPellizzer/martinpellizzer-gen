    "intro": "Romulea montana, commonly known as the mountain romulea, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of bright yellow flowers. The plant produces small, oval-shaped bulbs that store nutrients, allowing it to survive in harsh, alpine conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often forming a basal rosette. Romulea montana typically blooms in late spring to early summer, adding a vibrant touch to rocky and open habitats."
