    "intro": "Rhipsalis hileiabaiana, commonly known as the Hileiabaiana mistletoe cactus, is a rare epiphytic cactus native to the island of Hilo in Hawaii. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems covered with short, soft spines. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom during the winter months, followed by red, fleshy fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees in tropical rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
