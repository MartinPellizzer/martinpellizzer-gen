    "intro": "Rosa repens var. ovata, commonly known as the spreading bank rose, is a low-growing shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, arching stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink to white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are oval-shaped and have a slightly hairy texture, contributing to its ornamental appeal. This variety is often used in landscaping for its ability to stabilize soil and create a dense, flowering ground cover."
