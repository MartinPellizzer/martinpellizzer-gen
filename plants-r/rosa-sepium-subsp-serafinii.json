    "intro": "Rosa sepium subsp. serafinii, commonly known as the Serafini's rose, is a rare and ornamental species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and showy, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant prefers well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or alpine settings. Its foliage is dark green and glossy, adding to its aesthetic appeal. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a botanically significant and ecologically fragile species."
