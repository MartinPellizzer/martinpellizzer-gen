    "intro": "Ranunculus fallax subsp. macrodactylus, commonly known as the giant thimbleweed, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features distinctive, palmately lobed leaves that are often hairy and have a waxy coating. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with five broad, petal-like sepals, which are typically borne on long, slender stems. It thrives in moist, rich soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. The subspecies is characterized by its larger, more robust leaves compared to the typical form of *R. fallax*."
