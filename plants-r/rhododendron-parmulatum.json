    "intro": "Rhododendron parmulatum, commonly known as the creeping rhododendron, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the eastern United States. It features dense, dark green foliage and produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to red. The plant has a compact growth habit, often forming mats or cushions on the ground. Its leaves are leathery and have a distinctive waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Rhododendron parmulatum thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in moist, shaded forest environments."
