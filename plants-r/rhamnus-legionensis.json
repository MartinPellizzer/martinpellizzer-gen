It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by red or black berries that are a food source for various birds and mammals. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in landscaping in regions with similar climates."
