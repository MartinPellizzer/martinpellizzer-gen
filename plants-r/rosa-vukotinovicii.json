    "intro": "Rosa vukotinovicii, commonly known as the Vukotinovi\u0107 rose, is a rare and unique species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Europe. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces fragrant, semi-double flowers in shades of pink and white. The plant has elliptical, serrated leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of down. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun, thriving in temperate climates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
