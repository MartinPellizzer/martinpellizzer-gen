    "intro": "Restrepia wageneri, commonly known as the Wagener's lady's slipper, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, slipper-shaped flowers that are typically violet or purple in color. The plant has a short, thick rhizome and produces a single, showy flower per stem, which blooms during the dry season. Its habitat is highly specific, requiring cool, humid conditions with high levels of shade, making it particularly vulnerable to habitat loss and climate change."
