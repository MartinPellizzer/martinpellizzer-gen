    "intro": "Ruellia aquatica, commonly known as water ruellia, is a semi-aquatic plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and streams. The plant has heart-shaped, dark green leaves and produces clusters of blue or purple tubular flowers. It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water. Ruellia aquatica is also valued for its ornamental appeal in water gardens and bog landscapes."
