    "intro": "Rutidanthera, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a unique and rare plant native to the rainforests of northern Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its striking, lantern-shaped flowers that emit a faint bioluminescent glow at night, a phenomenon known as chemiluminescence. The plant's leaves are broad and heart-shaped, often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss in its humid, shaded habitat. Rutidanthera has a very limited distribution and is considered endangered due to habitat destruction and climate change. Its botanical significance lies in its unusual adaptations and potential applications in biotechnology and ecological research."
