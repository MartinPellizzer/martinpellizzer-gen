It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and rough, fissured bark that becomes more pronounced with age. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by small, woody fruits. It is well adapted to dry, rocky habitats and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. The species is valued for its hard, durable wood and is used in traditional construction and as a source of medicinal compounds."
