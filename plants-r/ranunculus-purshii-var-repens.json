    "intro": "Ranunculus purshii var. repens, commonly known as the creeping buttercup, is a low-growing perennial herb native to North America. It features a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread along the ground, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in early spring. Its leaves are palmately divided, and the stems are usually hairy. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and roadside areas."
