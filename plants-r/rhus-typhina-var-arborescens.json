    "intro": "Rhus typhina var. arborescens, commonly known as staghorn sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are bright green in summer and turn vibrant red in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in panicles, followed by red, fuzzy fruit clusters that persist into winter. Its roots are fibrous and can spread aggressively, making it a potential weed in some areas. The plant is adapted to a variety of soil types but thrives in well-drained, acidic soils."
