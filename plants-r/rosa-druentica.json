    "intro": "Rosa druentica, commonly known as the Alpine rose, is a species of flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes. The plant produces showy, pink to red flowers in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several elliptical leaflets, and its stems are covered in fine, glandular hairs. Rosa druentica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with well-draining soil and full sun."
