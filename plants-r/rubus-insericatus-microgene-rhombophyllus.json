    "intro": "Rubus insericatus microgene rhombophyllus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf blackberry, is a species of brambles native to the temperate regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems, trifoliate leaves with a distinctive rhomboidal shape, and small, aggregate fruits that turn from green to dark purple when ripe. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and partial shade, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its botanical features include stipitate stipules and persistent calyx lobes, which contribute to its identification. The species is valued for both its ornamental appeal and its edible fruits, though it can be invasive in certain ecosystems."
