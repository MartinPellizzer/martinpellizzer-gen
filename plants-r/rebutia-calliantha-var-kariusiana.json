    "intro": "Rebutia calliantha var. kariusiana, commonly known as the Kariusian Rebutia, is a compact, low-growing cactus native to South Africa. It features a globular to cylindrical stem with a ribbed structure, typically ranging from 5 to 15 centimeters in height. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers during the summer months, which are often borne on short, erect pedicels. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a dense covering of white to pale blue hairs. This variety is well-suited for rock gardens and requires well-draining soil and full sun to thrive."
