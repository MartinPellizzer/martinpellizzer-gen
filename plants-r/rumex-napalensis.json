    "intro": "Rumex napalensis, commonly known as the Napali sorrel, is a perennial herb native to the Pacific Islands, particularly Hawaii. It is characterized by its alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are often reddish or purple underneath, giving it a striking appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on slender, upright stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Rumex napalensis is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
