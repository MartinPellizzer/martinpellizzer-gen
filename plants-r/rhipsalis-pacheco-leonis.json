    "intro": "Rhipsalis pacheco-leonis, commonly known as the silver star cactus, is a species of epiphytic cactus native to Brazil. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems that are often covered in a silvery-gray waxy coating. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom during the winter months, adding a delicate touch to its appearance. Its leaves are modified into short, rounded structures that help reduce water loss. This plant thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
