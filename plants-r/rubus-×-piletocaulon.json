    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 piletocaulon, commonly known as the blackberry- raspberry hybrid, is a deciduous shrub characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves. It produces aggregate fruits composed of small, drupe-like berries that ripen to a deep red or black color. The plant is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils. It has a complex hybrid origin, resulting from crosses between Rubus species such as Rubus ursinus and Rubus idaeus. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological studies and horticultural breeding programs."
