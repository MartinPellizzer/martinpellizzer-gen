    "intro": "[WRONG START] Rubus \u00d7 astaraes, commonly known as the Astara blackberry, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Rubus ursinus (slippery elm) and Rubus  fruticosus (common bramble). It is characterized by its thorny stems and dark purple to black berries that are typically small to medium in size. The plant is native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States and thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil. Its berries are often used in jams and desserts due to their rich flavor and high pectin content. Botanically, it exhibits traits of both parent species, making it a subject of interest in horticultural studies."
