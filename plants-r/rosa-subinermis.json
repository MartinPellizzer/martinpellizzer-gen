    "intro": "Rosa subinermis, commonly known as the evergreen rose, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is characterized by its dense, thornless stems and leathery, dark green leaves that remain evergreen throughout the year. The plant produces fragrant, single or double pink flowers in spring, which are followed by red-orange hips that persist into winter. Rosa subinermis thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for coastal gardens. Its adaptability to saline and windy conditions makes it a valuable plant for stabilizing coastal dunes."
