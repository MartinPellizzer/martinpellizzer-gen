    "intro": "Racosperma viscifolium, commonly known as the sticky-leaf acacia, is a shrub native to Australia. It is characterized by its dense, glandular hairs that give its leaves a sticky texture. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in globular inflorescences, which are typical of the Acacia family. Its leaves are simple and alternate, with a prominent midrib and a velvety surface. Racosperma viscifolium is adapted to arid environments and is often found in coastal and sandy soils."
