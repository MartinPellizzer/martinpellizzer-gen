    "intro": "Rubus favratii, commonly known as the favrata bramble, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in countries like Afghanistan and Pakistan. The plant is characterized by its thorny stems, trifoliate leaves, and small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or black in color. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Rubus favratii is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species."
