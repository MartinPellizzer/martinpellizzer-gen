    "intro": "Rubus recurvans var. subrecurvans, commonly known as the slender blackberry, is a thorny shrub native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically edible, though they are often described as having a tart flavor. The plant has trifoliate leaves with serrated edges and grows in a variety of habitats, including forests and coastal areas. It is characterized by its trailing or climbing growth habit, which allows it to spread across the ground or climb over other vegetation. The flowers are usually white or pale pink, and they bloom in early spring."
