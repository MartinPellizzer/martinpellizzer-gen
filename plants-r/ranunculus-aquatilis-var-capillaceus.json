    "intro": "Ranunculus aquatilis var. capillaceus, commonly known as the water buttercup, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves and small yellow flowers with five petals. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and marshes. Its flowers open in the morning and close in the evening, a behavior known as nyctinasty. The species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize shoreline soils and support aquatic biodiversity."
