    "intro": "Rochelia disperma var. disperma, commonly known as the common rockweed, is a marine brown alga that thrives in intertidal zones along rocky shores. It has a filamentous thallus with a dark brown coloration and is typically found in shallow, nutrient-rich waters. The plant exhibits a branching structure that allows it to anchor itself to substrates using holdfasts. It plays a vital role in coastal ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various marine organisms. Its reproductive structures, including both sexual and asexual spores, contribute to its widespread distribution along coastal regions."
