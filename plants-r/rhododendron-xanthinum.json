It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows as an evergreen shrub, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, providing a striking contrast to the vibrant yellow blooms. Rhododendron xanthinum prefers acidic, well-drained soils and partial to full sun exposure."
