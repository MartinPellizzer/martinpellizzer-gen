    "intro": "Rubus glaucellus subsp. separatus, commonly known as the alpine raspberry, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, thorny stems and small, trifoliate leaves with a distinctive glaucous (bluish-gray) underside. The plant produces aggregate fruits composed of small, red drupes that ripen in late summer. It thrives in alpine and subalpine habitats, often growing in rocky or well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
