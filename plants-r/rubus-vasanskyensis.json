    "intro": "Rubus vasanskyensis, commonly known as the Vasansky's blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Rubus genus, which includes many species of shrubs commonly referred to as blackberries or raspberries. The plant is characterized by its thorny stems, trifoliate leaves, and aggregate fruits that ripen to a dark purple or black color. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and less-studied species within the Rubus family."
