It is a member of the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with slender stems that root at the nodes. Its small, white or pink flowers are clustered in terminal inflorescences, and it produces small, elliptical berries. Rossmannia repens is often used in ornamental horticulture for its attractive foliage and ability to form dense mats."
