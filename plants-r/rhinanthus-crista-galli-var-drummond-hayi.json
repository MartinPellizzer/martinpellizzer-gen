    "intro": "Rhinanthus crista-galli var. drummond-hayi, commonly known as Drummond's common tickseed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It is characterized by its bright yellow, tubular flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. This variant is native to North America and is often found in the central and eastern United States."
