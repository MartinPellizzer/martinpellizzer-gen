    "intro": "Rumex sagittifolius, commonly known as arrowleaf sorrel, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features heart-shaped, arrowhead-like leaves that are typically reddish or purple on the underside. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are often borne on slender stalks. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. The leaves are edible but have a sharp, tangy flavor due to their high oxalic acid content."
