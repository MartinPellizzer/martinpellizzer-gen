    "intro": "Racosperma kydrense, commonly known as the coastal acacia, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its pod fruits and nitrogen-fixing abilities. The plant features slender, often spiny branches and small, bipinnate leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Its flowers are yellow and clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences, attracting various pollinators. Racosperma kydrense is well-suited to sandy soils and is often found in dune habitats along the coastline."
