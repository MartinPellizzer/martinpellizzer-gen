It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family, which includes many showy, often toxic plants. The species is characterized by its bright yellow petals and deeply lobed leaves, typical of the genus Ranunculus. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
