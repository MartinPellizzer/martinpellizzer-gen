    "intro": "Ranunculus lundevallii, commonly known as the Swedish buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to northern Europe. It features delicate, palmately divided leaves and bright yellow, spurred flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. It is characterized by its short, hairy stems and is known for its ornamental value in gardens. However, it is toxic due to the presence of protoanemonin in its sap."
