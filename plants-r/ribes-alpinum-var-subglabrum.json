    "intro": "Ribes alpinum var. subglabrum, commonly known as the alpine gooseberry, is a compact shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring upright stems covered with small, elliptical leaves that are often slightly hairy but become glabrous in the variety subglabrum. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are clustered in cymes and are followed by edible, red, berry-like fruits. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to cold, alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
