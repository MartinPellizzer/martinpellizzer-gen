    "intro": "Rudgea sanmartensis, commonly known as the San Mart\u00edn rudgea, is a flowering plant native to the Andean region of South America. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its woody structure and showy flowers. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments within cloud forests, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, with five petals and prominent stamens, making it visually striking. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Rudgea sanmartensis is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
