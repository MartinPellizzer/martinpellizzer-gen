    "intro": "Rosa canina var. subhercynica, commonly known as the Eastern dog rose, is a shrub-like species native to central and eastern Europe. It is characterized by its thorny stems, oval-shaped leaves, and clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers. The plant produces red, hairy fruits called hips, which are rich in vitamin C. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and scrublands. This variety is less commonly cultivated than other rose species but is valued for its ornamental and historical significance."
