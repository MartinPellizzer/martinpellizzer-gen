    "intro": "Ritchiea insignis, commonly known as the Christmas fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, arching fronds that resemble a Christmas tree, hence its common name. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit and produces spores in small, clustered clusters on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Ritchiea insignis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to tolerate a range of soil conditions."
