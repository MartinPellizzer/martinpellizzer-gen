    "intro": "Rubus cryptadenus var. reichenbachii, commonly known as the alpine blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit, with thorny stems and compound leaves that are typically trifoliate. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are usually dark red to black in color. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its hardy nature, it is well adapted to high-altitude conditions and plays a role in local ecosystems."
