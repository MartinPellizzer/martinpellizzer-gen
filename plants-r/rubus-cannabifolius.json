    "intro": "Rubus cannabifolius, commonly known as the cannabis bramble, is a species of bramble native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its stout, thorny stems and compound leaves that resemble those of Cannabis sativa, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible berries that are typically red or black when mature. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forests and along stream banks. Due to its resemblance to Cannabis, it has been the subject of botanical interest and occasional confusion with marijuana species."
