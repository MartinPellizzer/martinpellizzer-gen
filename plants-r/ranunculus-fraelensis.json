    "intro": "Ranunculus fraelensis, commonly known as the Alpine buttercup, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, yellow flowers with numerous petals and a distinctive yellow center. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky habitats, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in high-altitude environments. Ranunculus fraelensis is a perennial species that plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
