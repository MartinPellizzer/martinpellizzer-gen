    "intro": "Rumex verticillatus subsp. fascicularis, commonly known as the clustered sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features basal rosettes of oval, reddish-green leaves with serrated edges, and it produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers in spring. The plant is characterized by its distinctive leaf arrangement, with leaves emerging in whorls around the stem. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats."
