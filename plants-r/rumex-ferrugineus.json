    "intro": "Rumex ferrugineus, commonly known as the rusty sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features basal rosettes of lance-shaped, reddish-tinged leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters along the stems. Its leaves are edible and have a sour, tangy flavor, making it a traditional forage plant. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in wet meadows and along stream banks."
