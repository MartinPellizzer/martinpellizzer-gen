    "intro": "Rhododendron luhuoense, commonly known as the Luhuo rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan Province in China. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows at high elevations, often in moist, shaded forest environments. The plant produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to red, blooming in the spring. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, providing a striking contrast to the vibrant floral display. Rhododendron luhuoense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and specialized horticultural collections."
