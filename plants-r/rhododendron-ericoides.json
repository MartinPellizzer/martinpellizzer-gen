    "intro": "Rhododendron ericoides, commonly known as the dwarf rhododendron, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Asia, particularly China and the Himalayas. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring dense, leathery leaves that are dark green and elliptical in shape. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers cool, moist environments with partial shade. Rhododendron ericoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for rock gardens and woodland plantings."
