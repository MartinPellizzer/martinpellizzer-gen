    "intro": "Rubus pseudoglaucinellus, commonly known as the alpine raspberry, is a species of bramble native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or yellow when mature. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
