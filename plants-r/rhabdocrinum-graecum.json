    "intro": "Rhabdocrinum graecum, commonly known as the Greek clubmoss, is a rare and ancient plant belonging to the family Lepidoziaceae. It is a small, evergreen herb with a rosette of needle-like leaves that form a dense, compact structure. The plant produces small, cone-like structures called strobila, which contain the reproductive organs. Rhabdocrinum graecum thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in temperate regions with high humidity. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
