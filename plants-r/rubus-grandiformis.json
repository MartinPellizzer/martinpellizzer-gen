    "intro": "Rubus grandiformis, commonly known as the large-leaf raspberry, is a species of bramble native to western North America. It is characterized by its trailing or climbing growth habit and its compound leaves, which are usually three to five leaflets. The plant produces aggregate fruits composed of small, red drupelets that are typically eaten by birds and small mammals. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
