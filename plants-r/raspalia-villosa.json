    "intro": "Raspalia villosa, commonly known as the hairy raspberry, is a perennial shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its woody stems covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that resemble raspberries, which are edible and have a tart flavor. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have serrated edges, contributing to its ornamental value. Raspalia villosa thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded forest environments."
