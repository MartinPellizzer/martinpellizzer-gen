It is characterized by its finely divided, floating leaves that form a rosette on the water surface. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers with five petals, typically appearing in early spring. It thrives in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. Its presence indicates good water quality and is often used as an indicator species in aquatic ecosystems."
