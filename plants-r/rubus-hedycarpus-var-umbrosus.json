It is characterized by its thorny stems and dark, elliptical leaves with a slightly serrated edge. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black in color. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and forest understories. Its botanical features make it well adapted to low-light conditions and cool, humid climates."
