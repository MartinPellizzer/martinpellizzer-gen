    "intro": "Rubus nitidus f. laciniatus, commonly known as the finely lobed blackberry, is a horticultural variant of the blackberry plant. It is characterized by its finely cut, serrated leaves that give it a distinctive, almost fern-like appearance. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically smaller than those of standard blackberries. It is a deciduous shrub that thrives in temperate climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. This cultivar is often valued for its ornamental appeal and unique foliage."
