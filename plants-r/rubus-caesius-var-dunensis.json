    "intro": "Rubus caesius var. dunensis, commonly known as the Dunedin raspberry, is a shrub native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its erect growth habit and produces small, red, edible berries. The plant has pinnately compound leaves with serrated edges and produces white flowers in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and subalpine regions. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
