    "intro": "Rubus hirtus var. aciculatissimus, commonly known as the needle-leaf blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its sharp, needle-like leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, dark purple berries that are typically less flavorful than other blackberry varieties. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and thickets. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and ecologically important species in its native habitat."
