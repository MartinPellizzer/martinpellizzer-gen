    "intro": "Rottboellia arundinacea, commonly known as false bamboo or wild millet, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features slender, cylindrical stems that resemble bamboo, with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in dense spikelets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it both a useful forage crop and a potential weed."
