It is characterized by its slender stems and small, elliptical leaves that are typically less than 2 cm in length. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that ripen in late summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
