    "intro": "Rapistrum hirsutum, commonly known as wild radish, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and pinnately compound leaves with serrated margins. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by round, green pods that mature into yellow or brown seed pods. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in fields. Rapistrum hirsutum is known for its ability to tolerate various soil conditions and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
