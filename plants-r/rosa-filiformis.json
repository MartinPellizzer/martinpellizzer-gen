    "intro": "Rosa filiformis, commonly known as the climbing rose or sand rose, is a species native to parts of Asia, including China and Japan. It is a perennial shrub that produces fragrant, single or semi-double flowers in shades of pink, red, and white. The plant is characterized by its slender, twining stems that allow it to climb and spread along the ground or over other vegetation. Its leaves are compound, consisting of multiple oval-shaped leaflets, and the flowers typically bloom in late spring to early summer. Rosa filiformis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is well-suited for garden use in temperate climates."
