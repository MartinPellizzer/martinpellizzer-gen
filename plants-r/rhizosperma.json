It is characterized by its basal rosettes of fleshy, often hairy leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant is native to various regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia, and it thrives in arid or semi-arid environments.

Some species are used in traditional medicine, while others are considered weeds in agricultural settings."
