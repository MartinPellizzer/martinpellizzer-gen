    "intro": "Rhodiola tricarpa, commonly known as the three-lobed rhodiola, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Crassulaceae and is characterized by its fleshy, succulent leaves and small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Rhodiola tricarpa is often found in alpine meadows and has a low-growing, cushion-like growth habit. Its botanical features make it well-suited for survival in harsh, arid climates."
