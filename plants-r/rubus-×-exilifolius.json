    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 exilifolius, commonly known as the slenderleaf blackberry, is a hybrid species within the Rubus genus, characterized by its small, thorny stems and trifoliate leaves. It is native to the western United States and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black in color, with a tart flavor. Its botanical features include a complex root system and dense, bristly foliage that aids in its survival in competitive habitats. Due to its hybrid origin, it exhibits a wide range of morphological variations."
