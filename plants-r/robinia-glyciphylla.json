    "intro": "Robinia glyciphylla, commonly known as the sweet acacia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and have a distinctive yellowish-green color. The plant produces fragrant, yellow pea-like flowers in spring, which are followed by long, flat pods containing seeds. Robinia glyciphylla is adapted to a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained soils and full sun. It is also known for its hardiness and ability to thrive in disturbed or marginal habitats."
