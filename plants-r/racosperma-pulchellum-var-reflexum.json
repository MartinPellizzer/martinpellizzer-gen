It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are usually pinnate and have a delicate, feathery appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in spikes, which are typical of the Acacia genus. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely used in horticulture."
