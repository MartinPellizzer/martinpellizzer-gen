    "intro": "Rubus duclouxii, commonly known as the Ducloux blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves, typical of the Rubus genus. The plant produces small, dark red berries that are typically harvested in the fall. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and partial shade. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and somewhat obscure species within the Rubus family."
