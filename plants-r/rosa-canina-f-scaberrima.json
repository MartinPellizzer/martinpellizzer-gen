It is characterized by its rough, bristly stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces fragrant, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early summer. Its fruits, known as hip fruits, are red, hairy, and contain numerous seeds. This subspecies is often found in woodland edges and scrub habitats across Europe and parts of Asia."
