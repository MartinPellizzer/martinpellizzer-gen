    "intro": "Rosa glauca f. bathyphylla, commonly known as the blue rose, is a rare and striking cultivar of the Rosa glauca species. It is characterized by its deep blue to violet flower color, which is a result of high levels of delphinidin pigments. This form is typically a compact shrub with thorny stems and dark green, glossy leaves. It thrives in cooler climates and well-drained soil, often found in alpine or rocky habitats. The plant is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in specialized gardens."
