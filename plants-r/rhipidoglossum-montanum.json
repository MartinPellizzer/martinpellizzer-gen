    "intro": "Rhipidoglossum montanum, commonly known as the mountain tongue fern, is a perennial fern native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its slender, upright fronds with a distinctive, tongue-like shape. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate, while its sporangia are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Rhipidoglossum montanum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
