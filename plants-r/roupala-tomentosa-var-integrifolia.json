    "intro": "Roupala tomentosa var. integrifolia, commonly known as the woolly roupala, is a shrub native to the temperate regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, white, woolly foliage that covers the stems and leaves, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptical in shape and have a soft, velvety texture. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by spherical, woody fruits. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
