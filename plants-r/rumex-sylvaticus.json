    "intro": "Rumex sylvaticus, commonly known as sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Polygonaceae family. It is characterized by its reddish stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves contain oxalic acid, which gives them a tart, sour taste. Rumex sylvaticus is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
