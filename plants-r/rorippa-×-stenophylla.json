    "intro": "Rorippa \u00d7 stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leafed watercress, is a hybrid species within the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its small, alternate leaves that are typically narrow and lance-shaped, often with a waxy coating. The plant thrives in moist or aquatic environments, such as stream banks and wet meadows, and is often found in temperate regions. Its flowers are small, yellow, and arranged in racemes, typical of the mustard family. Rorippa \u00d7 stenophylla is primarily a vegetative hybrid, often resulting from crosses between Rorippa palustris and Rorippa islandica."
