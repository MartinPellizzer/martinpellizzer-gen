It features bright green, rounded leaves that are often arranged in whorls around the stem, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white flowers that are typically borne on long, slender stalks. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments and is often used in aquariums and ponds for its ornamental value. Its rapid growth rate makes it effective for water filtration and algae control in aquatic habitats."
