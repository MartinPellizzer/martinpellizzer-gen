    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus subsp. pilicaulis, commonly known as the golden buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It features showy, bright yellow flowers with five to eight petals, often surrounded by a ring of green sepals. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are alternate and covered in a soft, downy coating. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges. The subspecies pilicaulis is distinguished by its shorter, more compact growth habit compared to other forms of Ranunculus auricomus."
