    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 jordanninus, commonly known as the Jordanian blackberry, is a hybrid species within the Rubus genus, characterized by its thorny stems and aggregate fruits. It is native to the Middle East, particularly Jordan, and thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils. The plant produces dark purple to black berries that are typically small to medium in size. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and edible fruits, though its cultivation is limited due to its specific environmental requirements. The species exhibits genetic diversity due to its hybrid origin, making it an interesting subject for botanical study."
