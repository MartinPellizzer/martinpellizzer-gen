    "intro": "Rhododendron wasonii var. rhododactylum, commonly known as the Japanese rhododendron, is a compact evergreen shrub native to Japan. It features broad, dark green leaves that are leathery in texture and arranged in whorls along the stems. The plant produces clusters of showy, funnel-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to red, blooming in late spring to early summer. It prefers acidic, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Due to its ornamental value and limited natural range, it is often cultivated in specialized horticultural settings."
