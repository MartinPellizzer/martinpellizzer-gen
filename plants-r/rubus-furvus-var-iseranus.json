    "intro": "Rubus furvus var. iseranus, commonly known as the alpine raspberry, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its prickly stems and clusters of small, usually red or orange berries. The plant thrives in alpine and subalpine environments, often growing at high altitudes where temperatures are cool and sunlight is abundant. Its leaves are typically trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it produces white or pink flowers in the spring. The berries are edible but have a tart flavor and are sometimes used in local cuisines or traditional medicine."
