It thrives in coastal areas, estuaries, and brackish waters, often forming dense underwater meadows. The plant has slender, ribbon-like leaves that are typically submerged, with small, greenish flowers that bloom in the spring. It plays an important role in stabilizing sediments and providing habitat for aquatic organisms. Its distribution is primarily in the Mediterranean region and parts of the Atlantic coast."
