It is characterized by its unique, hairy leaves and striking, often fragrant flowers that come in a variety of colors. The plant typically grows in rocky or forested areas, thriving in cool and humid conditions. It has a short flowering period, usually during the spring or early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
