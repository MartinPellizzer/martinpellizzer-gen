It is characterized by its striking, butterfly-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in tropical rainforests. Its roots are adapted for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. The flowers emit a mild fragrance, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
