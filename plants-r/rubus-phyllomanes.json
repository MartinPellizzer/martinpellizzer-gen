    "intro": "Rubus phyllomanes, commonly known as the silverleaf blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its dark purple to black berries, which are typically small and covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant has compound leaves with three to five leaflets, often with serrated edges. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, moist environments. The berries are edible but are generally less palatable than those of other Rubus species."
