    "intro": "Rosa zamensis, commonly known as the Zamorano rose, is a species native to South America, particularly found in Argentina and Chile. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring thorny stems and dark green, serrated leaves. The plant produces fragrant, semi-double flowers in shades of pink and white, which bloom in the spring. Its botanical characteristics include a woody stem with a high density of lignified tissue, contributing to its structural strength. Rosa zamensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its beauty and resilience."
