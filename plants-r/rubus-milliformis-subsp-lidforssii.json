    "intro": "Rubus milliformis subsp. lidforssii, commonly known as the alpine blackberry, is a shrub native to the high-altitude regions of southern Scandinavia. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and small, dark red to black fruits that ripen in late summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it produces white flowers in early summer. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological adaptations and limited distribution."
