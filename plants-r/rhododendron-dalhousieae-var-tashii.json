    "intro": "Rhododendron dalhousieae var. tashii, commonly known as the Tashii rhododendron, is a variant native to the Himalayas, particularly in regions of India and Nepal. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows at high altitudes, often in moist, shaded forest environments. The plant features dense clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to red, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are leathery and elliptical, providing a striking contrast to the vibrant floral displays. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with the right acidic soil and partial shade conditions."
