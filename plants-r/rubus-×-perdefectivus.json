    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 perdefectivus, commonly known as the blackberry bramble, is a hybrid plant within the Rubus genus. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves, typical of many bramble species. The plant produces aggregate fruits, which are commonly referred to as blackberries, and are known for their sweet, juicy flavor. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges or disturbed soils. Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it requires careful management to prevent ecological disruption."
