    "intro": "Rhynchospora rigidifolia subsp. planifolia, commonly known as the flat-leaved marsh sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes and wet meadows. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are flat and arranged in a dense, cylindrical cluster. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually clustered in spikelets, and it blooms during the summer months. This subspecies is characterized by its rigid, upright growth habit and is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological importance."
