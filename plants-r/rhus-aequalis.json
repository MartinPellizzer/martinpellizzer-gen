    "intro": "Rhus aequalis, commonly known as the smooth sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically pinnately arranged with 11 to 31 leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in upright clusters, followed by red, fuzzy berries that are an important food source for wildlife. Rhus aequalis thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in disturbed soils along roadsides and in open woodlands. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a common sight in many eastern North American landscapes."
