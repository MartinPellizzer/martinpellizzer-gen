    "intro": "Rhus americana, commonly known as staghorn sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are opposite and pinnate, with serrated margins. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, fuzzy berries that attract birds and other wildlife. Its bark is thick and rough, often with a distinctive, rugged texture. Rhus americana is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in open woodlands, along roadsides, and in disturbed areas."
