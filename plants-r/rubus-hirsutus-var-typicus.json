    "intro": "Rubus hirsutus var. typicus, commonly known as the bristly blackberry, is a perennial shrub native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its thorny stems, trifoliate leaves, and aggregate fruits that develop from multiple small drupes. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, often found in woodland edges and disturbed habitats. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, and the berries are edible when fully ripe, though they may have a tart flavor. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
