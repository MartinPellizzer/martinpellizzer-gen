    "intro": "Ricinus communis, commonly known as the castor oil plant, is a flowering plant native to the eastern and southern regions of Africa. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves and distinctive spiny capsules that contain toxic, oily seeds. The plant produces showy yellow flowers and is known for its rapid growth and adaptability to various climates. Its seeds are the source of castor oil, which has industrial and medicinal applications. However, all parts of the plant contain toxic compounds, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals."
