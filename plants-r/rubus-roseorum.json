It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves, typical of the Rubus genus. The plant produces small, edible berries that are similar in taste to raspberries but have a more delicate flavor. Its flowers are usually pink or white, adding to its ornamental value in gardens. The plant thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodlands and along hedgerows."
