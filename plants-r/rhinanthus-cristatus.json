    "intro": "Rhinanthus cristatus, commonly known as the crowned orchid, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its striking yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Its unique appearance and ecological role make it a notable species in botanical studies."
