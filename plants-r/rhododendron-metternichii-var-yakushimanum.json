    "intro": "Rhododendron metternichii var. yakushimanum, commonly known as the Yakushimanum rhododendron, is a compact evergreen shrub native to the Japanese islands of Yakushima and Kuchinoerabu. It features dense, leathery leaves that are dark green and glossy, often with a slight pubescence. The plant produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to red, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to form dense, lush foliage year-round."
