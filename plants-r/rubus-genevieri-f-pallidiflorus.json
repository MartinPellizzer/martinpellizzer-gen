    "intro": "Rubus genevieri f. pallidiflorus, commonly known as the pale-flowered blackberry, is a botanical variant of the Rubus genus. It is characterized by its pale pink to white flowers, which contrast with the typical red or pink blooms of other Rubus species. The plant is a shrub with thorny stems and compound leaves, typical of many brambles. Its fruits, like other blackberries, are aggregate berries that develop from multiple ovaria. This subspecies is often found in temperate regions, growing in woodland edges and disturbed soils."
