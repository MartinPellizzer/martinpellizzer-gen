    "intro": "Rubus variabilis var. nitidus, commonly known as the glossy blackberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its dark, glossy foliage and thorny stems, which are typical features of the Rubus genus. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black in color when mature. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or riparian habitats. Due to its ornamental value and edible berries, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and naturalized areas."
