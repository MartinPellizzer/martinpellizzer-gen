    "intro": "Rubus colemannii var. chloocalyx, commonly known as the coastal blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and thorny stems, which help it to cling to coastal vegetation. The leaves are typically three-lobed and have a dark green, glossy appearance. Its flowers are small, white, and clustered, followed by dark purple to black berries that ripen in late summer. This plant thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in coastal dunes and tidal zones."
