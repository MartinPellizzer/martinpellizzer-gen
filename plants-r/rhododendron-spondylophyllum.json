    "intro": "Rhododendron spondylophyllum, commonly known as the Spondylophyllum rhododendron, is a rare and striking evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range in color from deep red to pink, often with a distinctive yellow or white throat. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, providing a striking contrast to its vibrant blooms. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a valuable but endangered species in its native range."
