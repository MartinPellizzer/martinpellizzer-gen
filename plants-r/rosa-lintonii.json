    "intro": "Rosa lintonii, commonly known as the Linton's rose, is a rare and delicate species native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a subtle red hue at the base. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, preferring well-drained soil and cool climates. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and its stems are covered in soft, pale pink to white hairs. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Rosa lintonii is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
