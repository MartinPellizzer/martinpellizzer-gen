    "intro": "Ryticaryum fasciculatum, commonly known as the clustered bract plant, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. It typically grows in moist, temperate regions and is known for its distinctive, clustered bracts that enclose the small, white flowers. The plant's leaves are finely divided and emit a mild, spicy scent when crushed. It is often found in woodland edges and shaded areas, where it thrives in partial to full shade. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and natural habitats."
