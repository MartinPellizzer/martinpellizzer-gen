    "intro": "Rubus commixtus f. glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular raspberry, is a variant of the common raspberry with distinctive botanical features. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a rough texture. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red when ripe, though they may vary in color depending on the environment. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges or disturbed soils. Its unique morphology makes it a subject of interest in botanical studies and horticulture."
