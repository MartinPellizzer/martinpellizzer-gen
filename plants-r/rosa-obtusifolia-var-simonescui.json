    "intro": "Rosa obtusifolia var. simonescui, commonly known as the Simonescu's shrub rose, is a compact, deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Romania. It features dense, thornless stems that produce clusters of small, fragrant, pink flowers in early summer. The leaves are dark green, glossy, and arranged in odd-pinnate patterns, with finely serrated leaflets. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and hardy nature, thriving in well-drained soil and full sun. It is also noted for its ability to attract pollinators and its resistance to common rose diseases."
