It is a member of the Geraniaceae family and typically grows in wetland habitats such as bogs and marshes. The plant features narrow, aromatic leaves that resemble those of rosemary, hence its common name. It produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. Rhexia rosmarinifolia is often found in shaded, moist environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils."
