    "intro": "Rhamnus pianensis, commonly known as the Pianese buckthorn, is a small to medium-sized shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its dense, thorny branches and small, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by dark blue, fleshy berries that are edible for birds but generally unpalatable to humans. Rhamnus pianensis is often found in rocky soils and scrublands, thriving in dry, sunny environments. Its botanical features make it an important component of Mediterranean flora and a subject of ecological study."
