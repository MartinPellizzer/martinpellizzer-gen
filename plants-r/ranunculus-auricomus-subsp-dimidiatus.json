    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus subsp. dimidiatus, commonly known as the half-leaved buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features showy yellow flowers with five distinct sepals that resemble petals, and its leaves are deeply divided into three parts. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments such as meadows and forest margins. It has a short flowering period in spring and is characterized by its hairy stems and lobed leaves. The subspecies is distinguished by its smaller, more compact flowers compared to the typical form of Ranunculus auricomus."
