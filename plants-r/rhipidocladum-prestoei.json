    "intro": "Rhipidocladum prestoei, commonly known as the coastal dune shrub, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of South America. It is characterized by its low-growing, woody structure and succulent leaves that help it retain water in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in sandy soils and is adapted to withstand strong coastal winds and salt spray. Rhipidocladum prestoei plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dune systems and preventing erosion."
