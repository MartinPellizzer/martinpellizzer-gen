    "intro": "Rubus hirtus var. iskrensis, commonly known as the Iskrenskaya bramble, is a variant of the bramble genus Rubus native to specific regions of Eastern Europe. It is characterized by its thorny stems, trifoliate leaves, and small, aggregate fruits known as drupes. The plant typically grows in moist, woodland habitats and is adapted to temperate climates. Its botanical features include hairy foliage and a compact growth habit, which aid in its survival in shaded environments. This variant is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique morphological traits."
