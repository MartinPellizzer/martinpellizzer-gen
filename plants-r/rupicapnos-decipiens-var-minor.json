    "intro": "Rupicapnos decipiens var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf red-twig dogwood, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking red stems that become prominent in winter. The plant produces small, white flowers in late spring, which are followed by blue-black berries that are attractive to birds. Its foliage is typically a deep green in summer, turning red or orange in the fall. It thrives in partial to full shade and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardiness."
