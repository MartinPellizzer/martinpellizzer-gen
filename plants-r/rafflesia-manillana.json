    "intro": "Rafflesia manillana, commonly known as the Manilla rafflesia, is a parasitic flowering plant native to the rainforests of the Philippines. It is renowned for producing one of the largest individual flowers in the world, which can reach up to 30 inches in diameter. The plant lacks leaves, stems, and roots, relying entirely on its host vine for nutrients. Its flowers emit a strong, unpleasant odor resembling decaying flesh, which attracts flies and other insects for pollination. The plant's unique biology and striking appearance make it a subject of both scientific interest and cultural fascination."
