    "intro": "Ranunculus feniculaceus, commonly known as the lesser celandine, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family, characterized by its showy, often bright yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are palmately lobed, and the flowers consist of numerous petal-like sepals rather than true petals. It is known for its early spring bloom and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
