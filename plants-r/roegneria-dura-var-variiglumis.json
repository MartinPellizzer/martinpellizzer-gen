It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, dark green foliage. The plant produces spikelets that are typically arranged in clusters, with lemmas that are often hairy and slightly compressed. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid regions. Its botanical features make it a valuable forage plant and a subject of study in grassland ecology."
