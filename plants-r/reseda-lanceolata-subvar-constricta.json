It typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in open grasslands and rocky soils. The plant has slender, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. Its botanical features include a fibrous root system and a branching stem that is often reddish in color. This species is adapted to drought conditions and is sometimes used in restoration projects due to its resilience."
