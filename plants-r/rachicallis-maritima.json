    "intro": "Rachicallis maritima, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its spiny, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has succulent leaves and stems, which help it retain moisture in salty, windy environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or along the shoreline. Its unique appearance and hardy nature make it a notable species in coastal botany."
