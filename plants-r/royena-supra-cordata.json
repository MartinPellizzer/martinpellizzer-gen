    "intro": "Royena supra-cordata, commonly known as the broad-leaved royal fern, is a tropical plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with long, creeping underground stems that help it spread. Its fronds are usually bipinnate, giving it a feathery appearance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests."
