    "intro": "Rhachidosorus blotianus, commonly known as the Blotian fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to tropical regions. It features a rhizomatous growth habit with long, creeping stems that produce clustered fronds. The fronds are typically lanceolate or ovate in shape, with a smooth, glossy surface. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of the fronds, which are clustered in sori. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
