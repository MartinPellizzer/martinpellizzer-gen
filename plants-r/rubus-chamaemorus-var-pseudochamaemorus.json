    "intro": "Rubus chamaemorus var. pseudochamaemorus, commonly known as the dwarf crowberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to Arctic and subarctic regions. It features small, dark blue berries that are edible and often used in traditional foods. The plant has dense, mat-forming growth with hairy, leathery leaves that help it survive in cold climates. It thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic soils and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions. This variant is closely related to the common crowberry but is distinguished by its smaller size and specific habitat preferences."
