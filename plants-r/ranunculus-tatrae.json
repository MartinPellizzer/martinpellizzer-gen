    "intro": "Ranunculus tatrae, commonly known as the Tatra water crowfoot, is a perennial aquatic plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It thrives in clear, cold streams and lakes, often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. The plant has finely divided, arrow-shaped leaves that float on the water surface, while its roots anchor it to the substrate. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, with five to seven petals and numerous stamens. Ranunculus tatrae plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and small fish."
