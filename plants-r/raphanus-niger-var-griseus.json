    "intro": "Raphanus niger var. griseus, commonly known as the gray mustard, is a biennial plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its upright, hairy stems and alternate, pinnately lobed leaves that are covered in a fine grayish pubescence. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which are followed by elongated, cylindrical siliques containing numerous small, black seeds. It is native to Europe and Asia and is often found in disturbed soils, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its rapid growth and seed dispersal, it can become invasive in certain regions."
