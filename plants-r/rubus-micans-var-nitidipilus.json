    "intro": "Rubus micans var. nitidipilus, commonly known as the glossy-leaf bramble, is a variant of the bramble genus Rubus native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are often densely hairy underneath, giving it a unique texture. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in the spring, followed by red, edible berries in the summer. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for horticultural and ecological studies."
