    "intro": "Rudbeckia alismifolia, commonly known as the water lily rudbeckia, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features striking yellow-orange ray flowers surrounded by a cluster of dark brown disk flowers, typical of the Rudbeckia genus. The plant has heart-shaped, smooth, and slightly hairy leaves that are often submerged or floating, adapting to wetland environments. Its root system is fibrous and helps stabilize the soil in aquatic habitats. Rudbeckia alismifolia thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in marshes, pond edges, and along streams."
