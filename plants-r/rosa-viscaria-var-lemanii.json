    "intro": "Rosa viscaria var. lemanii, commonly known as the Leman's rose, is a compact, shrubby perennial native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features dense, thornless stems that produce clusters of small, fragrant, pinkish-white flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant has dark green, glossy leaves that are oval-shaped with serrated edges. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. Its hardy nature and ornamental value make it a popular choice for gardeners seeking a low-maintenance, visually appealing shrub."
