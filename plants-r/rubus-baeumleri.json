    "intro": "Rubus baeumleri, commonly known as the Baeumleri blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the mountainous regions of central and southern China. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves, typical of the Rubus genus. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black in color. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and partial shade. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native range."
