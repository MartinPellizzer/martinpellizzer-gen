    "intro": "Rubus deruyveri, commonly known as the Congo blackberry, is a species of bramble native to Central and West Africa. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves, typical of the Rubus genus. The plant produces small, dark red to black fruits that are often edible, though they may have a tart flavor. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in moist, shaded areas. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and less-studied member of the Rubus family."
