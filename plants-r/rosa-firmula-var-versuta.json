    "intro": "Rosa firmula var. versuta, commonly known as the creeping shrub rose, is a compact, low-growing rose species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features wiry, thorny stems that often lie close to the ground, forming dense mats or small shrubs. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink to white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and covered in fine, soft hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Rosa firmula var. versuta is well adapted to rocky and arid environments, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens and alpine settings."
