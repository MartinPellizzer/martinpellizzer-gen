    "intro": "Rafflesia keithii, commonly known as the Malaysian Rafflesia, is a parasitic plant that lacks leaves, stems, and roots. It is characterized by its large, fleshy, and odorless flower, which can grow up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The plant is found in the lowland rainforests of Borneo, where it grows on the roots of Tetrastigma vines. Its flowers emit a strong smell reminiscent of rotting meat to attract pollinators like flies and beetles. Due to habitat destruction, Rafflesia keithii is considered a rare and endangered species."
