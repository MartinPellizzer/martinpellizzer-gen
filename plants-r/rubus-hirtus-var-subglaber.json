    "intro": "Rubus hirtus var. subglaber, commonly known as the smooth blackberry, is a perennial shrub native to the eastern United States. It features thorny stems and alternate, pinnately compound leaves with serrated margins. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by dark purple to black berries in the summer. Its fruit is edible, though the foliage and stems are typically prickly and not suitable for consumption. The plant thrives in partial shade to full sun and is often found in woodland edges and thickets."
