    "intro": "Roycea pycnophylloides, commonly known as the dense-leaved rockrose, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense, leathery foliage that is typically covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink, usually blooming in spring. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and often have a waxy texture, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Roycea pycnophylloides is well adapted to rocky and sandy soils, making it a hardy plant suitable for xeriscaping."
