    "intro": "Rhynchosia swynnertonii, commonly known as the Swynnerton's burr legume, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive pod-like fruits that encase its seeds. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, featuring compound leaves and showy yellow or orange flowers. Its seeds are encased in a thick, spiny pod, which aids in seed dispersal by attaching to animal fur or clothing. Rhynchosia swynnertonii is also valued for its potential use in traditional medicine and as a source of forage for livestock."
