It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its small, palmate leaves and clusters of pale yellow flowers. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
