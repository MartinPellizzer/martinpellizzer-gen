    "intro": "Rubus lochmaeus, commonly known as the Scottish blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the British Isles. It is a shrub that typically grows in woodland and grassland habitats, often in moist, acidic soils. The plant produces small, dark red to black berries that are edible and have a tart flavor. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the stems are covered in fine, prickly hairs. The plant plays an important role in supporting local wildlife, including birds and insects."
