It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its small, dark green leaves and yellow flowers. The plant produces small, reddish berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in rocky, sunny environments and is often found in coastal areas. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native range."
