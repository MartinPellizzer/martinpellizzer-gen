    "intro": "Rhynchosia cliffordii, commonly known as the Clifford's cowpea, is a species of flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It is a climbing legume characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant produces pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are often used as a food source. Rhynchosia cliffordii is adapted to grow in dry, sandy soils and is often found in disturbed habitats. It plays a role in soil nitrogen fixation due to its association with nitrogen-fixing bacteria."
