It is characterized by its prickly stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black when mature. It thrives in woodland edges and disturbed soils, often forming dense thickets. Its botanical features make it an important component of native ecosystems and a subject of study in plant ecology."
