It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or shaded areas. The plant produces clusters of blue to violet flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and have a smooth, glossy surface. Shreve's ruellia is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partial shade."
