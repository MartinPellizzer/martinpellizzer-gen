    "intro": "Raritebe blumii, commonly known as the Moonlight Orchid, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the misty highlands of the Andes. It features delicate, pale lavender petals with a subtle iridescent sheen, giving it a mystical appearance under moonlight. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that bloom primarily during the cooler months, typically from late autumn to early spring. Its leaves are broad and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in its high-altitude environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Raritebe blumii is considered endangered and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for conservation purposes."
