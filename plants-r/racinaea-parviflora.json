    "intro": "Racinaea parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered racinaea, is a species of flowering plant in the family Araceae. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant features a short, stocky rhizome with broad, arrow-shaped leaves that are dark green and glossy. Its inflorescence consists of a spadix surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe, which is typically white or pale yellow. Racinaea parviflora is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique foliage and delicate floral structure."
