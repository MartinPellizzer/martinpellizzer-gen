    "intro": "Rubus euryphyllus, commonly known as the broad-leaf blackberry, is a species of brambles native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and large, serrated leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter in color underneath. The plant produces aggregate fruits composed of small, dark purple to black drupelets, which are usually sweet and edible. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and thickets. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and naturalized areas."
