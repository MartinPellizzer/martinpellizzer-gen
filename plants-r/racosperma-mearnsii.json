It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its nitrogen-fixing ability through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. The plant features compound leaves with multiple leaflets and produces yellow or orange flowers that attract pollinators. Its seeds are enclosed in pods and are often used in traditional medicine by Indigenous communities.
