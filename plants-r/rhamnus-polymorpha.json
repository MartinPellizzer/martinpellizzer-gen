    "intro": "Rhamnus polymorpha, commonly known as the many-stemmed buckthorn, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, thorny growth and small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by dark blue berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in horticulture for erosion control and as a decorative plant."
