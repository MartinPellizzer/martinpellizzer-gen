    "intro": "Rhododendron glischrum subsp. glischrum, commonly known as the alpine rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Asia, particularly in China, Nepal, and Bhutan. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense foliage, often forming thickets in high-altitude environments. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink to red in color, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in cool, moist climates with well-drained acidic soil, often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
