    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus subsp. angustus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features finely divided, fern-like leaves and bright yellow flowers with five petals. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks. It blooms from late spring to early summer, producing showy flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The subspecies is distinguished by its narrower leaves compared to the typical form of Ranunculus auricomus."
