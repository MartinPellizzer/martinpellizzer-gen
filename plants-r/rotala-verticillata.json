    "intro": "Rotala verticillata, commonly known as the waterwheel plant, is a submerged aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features whorled leaves that are typically 2\u20136 cm long, arranged in a distinctive spiral pattern around the stem. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or white, which are followed by small, round fruits. It is often used in aquariums and ponds due to its ability to provide oxygen and habitat for aquatic life. Rotala verticillata thrives in shallow, still or slow-moving waters with moderate to high light conditions."
