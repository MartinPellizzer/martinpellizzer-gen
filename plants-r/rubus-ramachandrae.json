    "intro": "Rubus ramachandrae, commonly known as the Ramachandran bramble, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of southern India, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its thorny stems, trifoliate leaves, and small white to pink flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruits are aggregate berries, typically red or black when mature, and are edible. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
