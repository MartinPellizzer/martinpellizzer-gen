    "intro": "Rhamnus cornifolia var. cornifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a distinctive, slightly waxy texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by dark blue berries that are an important food source for birds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and thickets. Its botanical features make it a notable species in ecological studies and native plant gardens."
