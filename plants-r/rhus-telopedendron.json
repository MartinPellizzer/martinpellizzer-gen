It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown stems that become more pronounced with age. The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by red berries that are an important food source for birds. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a serrated edge, turning yellow in the fall. Rhus telopedendron is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
