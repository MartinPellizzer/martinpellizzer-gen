    "intro": "Rosa \u00d7 dumetorum var. hirta, commonly known as the hairy shrub rose, is a hybrid species characterized by its dense, thorny growth habit and compact form. It features small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges and a slightly hairy texture, contributing to its common name. This variety is native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America, where it thrives in cooler, moist environments. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its hardiness and ability to attract pollinators."
