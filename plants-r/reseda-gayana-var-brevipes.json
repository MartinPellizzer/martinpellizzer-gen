    "intro": "Reseda gayana var. brevipes, commonly known as the short-stemmed everlasting pea, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Fabaceae. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale yellow to reddish-brown. The plant produces small, spherical seed pods that contain several seeds, which are often used in floral arrangements due to their durability. Native to South America, it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long-lasting flowers, which retain their color and form even after drying."
