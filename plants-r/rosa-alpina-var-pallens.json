    "intro": "Rosa alpina var. pallens, commonly known as the pale alpine rose, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing clusters of five-petaled flowers. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and covered in a fine layer of white down, giving them a silvery appearance. This variety is well adapted to cold, alpine environments and thrives in well-drained, rocky soils."
