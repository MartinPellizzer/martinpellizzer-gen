It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes other cruciferous vegetables like cabbage and broccoli. The plant typically grows to a height of less than 30 centimeters, featuring small, lobed leaves and yellow flowers. Its root system is fibrous and produces small, edible roots similar to those of radishes. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often cultivated for its mild, peppery flavor."
