    "intro": "Ranunculus philopadus, commonly known as the alpine buttercup, is a flowering plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is a perennial herb with a short, stout rhizome and typically grows in moist, rocky habitats. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with five to seven petals, often accompanied by numerous stamens. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a hairy surface that helps reduce water loss in its alpine environment. Ranunculus philopadus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate, early spring blooms."
