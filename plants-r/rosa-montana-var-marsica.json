    "intro": "Rosa montana var. marsica, commonly known as the Marsican mountain rose, is a compact shrub native to the mountainous regions of central Italy. It features dense, thornless stems and glossy, dark green foliage that remains evergreen throughout the year. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, semi-double pink flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. Its hardiness and ornamental value make it a popular choice for gardeners seeking a low-maintenance, visually appealing shrub."
