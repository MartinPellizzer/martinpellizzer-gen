    "intro": "Rubus lineatus var. diengensis, commonly known as the Dieng raspberry, is a variant of the raspberry plant native to the highlands of Indonesia. It is a shrub characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red when ripe, though they may vary in color depending on the environment. It thrives in cool, humid climates and is often found in mountainous regions with well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
