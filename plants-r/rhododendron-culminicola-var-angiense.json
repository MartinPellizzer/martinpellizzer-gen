    "intro": "Rhododendron culminicola var. angiense, commonly known as the Alpine Rhododendron, is a rare and high-altitude plant native to the Himalayas. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at elevations above 3,000 meters. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, often covered in a fine, waxy coating to reduce water loss. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator species of alpine ecosystems."
