    "intro": "Rosa oreophila, commonly known as the mountain rose, is a species of flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense, thorny stems. The plant produces showy, single or double flowers in shades of pink and white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and covered in fine hairs, while its fruits are red, hairy rose hips. Rosa oreophila is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to cooler, high-altitude environments."
