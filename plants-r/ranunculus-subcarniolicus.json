    "intro": "Ranunculus subcarniolicus, commonly known as the Carpathian buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the Carpathian Mountains. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and showy, yellow flowers with numerous stamens. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. It has a short life cycle and is adapted to the cool, temperate climates of its native region. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
