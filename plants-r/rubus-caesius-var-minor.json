It produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically harvested in late summer. The plant has trifoliate leaves with serrated edges and produces white to pale pink flowers in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for cultivation in gardens. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is often used in native plant landscaping."
