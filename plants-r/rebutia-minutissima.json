    "intro": "Rebutia minutissima, commonly known as the miniature cushion cactus, is a small, low-growing cactus native to South America. It features dense, rounded clusters of pale green to blue-gray stems that are covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Its compact size and unique appearance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and container cultivation."
