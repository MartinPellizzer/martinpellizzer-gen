It is characterized by its finely hairy, silver-gray leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, red berries that are typically edible but have a tart flavor. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its attractive foliage and seasonal berries."
