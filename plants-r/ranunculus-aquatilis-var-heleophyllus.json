    "intro": "Ranunculus aquatilis var. heleophyllus, commonly known as the sun-leaf water buttercup, is a variant of the water buttercup found in aquatic or wetland environments. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers and finely divided, feathery leaves that help it float on the water's surface. The plant thrives in shallow, still waters such as ponds and marshes, where it can receive ample sunlight. Its leaves are adapted for buoyancy, while its roots anchor it in the muddy substrate. This variety is notable for its delicate appearance and its role in supporting aquatic ecosystems."
