    "intro": "Rumex acetosella var. gymnocarpus, commonly known as lesser sorrel, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its succulent, reddish stems and trifoliate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands, meadows, and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a common weed in disturbed soils."
