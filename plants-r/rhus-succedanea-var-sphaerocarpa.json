    "intro": "Rhus succedanea var. sphaerocarpa, commonly known as the staghorn sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and turn vibrant red in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by red, spherical fruits that persist through winter. Its bark is thick and rugged, giving it a distinctive, staghorn-like appearance. The plant is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in open woods, fields, and along streambanks."
