    "intro": "Rhodomyrtus vieillardii, commonly known as the Vietnamese rose or red sandalwood, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by bright red berries. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine, it is sometimes cultivated for its aesthetic and practical properties."
