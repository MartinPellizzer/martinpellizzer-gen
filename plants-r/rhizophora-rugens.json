    "intro": "Rhizophora rugens, commonly known as the mangrove apple or red mangrove, is a species of mangrove tree native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive aerial roots, which provide structural support and facilitate gas exchange in waterlogged soils. The plant has smooth, reddish bark and produces small, apple-like fruits that are dispersed by water. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Rhizophora rugens plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species."
