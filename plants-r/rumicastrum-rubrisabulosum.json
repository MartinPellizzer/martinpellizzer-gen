    "intro": "Rumicastrum rubrisabulosum, commonly known as the red sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its hairy stems and showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, such as sandy soils and rocky areas. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. The species is often found in association with other desert flora, contributing to the ecological diversity of its native range."
