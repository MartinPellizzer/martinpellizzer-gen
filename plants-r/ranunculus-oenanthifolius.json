It features delicate, yellow flowers with five petals, often surrounded by a ring of sepals that resemble additional petals. The plant has a basal rosette of leaves that are deeply lobed and covered in a fine, waxy coating. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it a notable species in both ecological and horticultural contexts."
