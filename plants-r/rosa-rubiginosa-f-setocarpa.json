    "intro": "Rosa rubiginosa f. setocarpa, commonly known as the rough rose or hairy rose, is a shrub-like plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its thorny stems and dark red to purplish stems that are often covered in a rough, glandular coating. The leaves are typically pinnately compound, with serrated leaflets that are covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are usually pale pink to white, with five petals and numerous stamens, and they bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, red, berry-like fruits that are edible but have a tart, acidic flavor."
