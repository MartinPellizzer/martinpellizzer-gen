    "intro": "Rosa solstitialis denudata, commonly known as the naked-stemmed rose, is a species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, often hairless stems and clusters of fragrant, pink or white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in wet, swampy areas and has elliptical, dark green leaves that are opposite in arrangement. It produces small, red hips that contain seeds, and its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
