It is characterized by its distinctive, begonia-like leaves that are deeply lobed and have a velvety texture. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or black when mature. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
