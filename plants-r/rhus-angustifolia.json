    "intro": "Rhus angustifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 3\u20135 pairs of narrow, elliptical leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in panicles, followed by clusters of red, fuzzy berries that are an important food source for wildlife. Its roots are deep and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in well-drained soils. The plant is often found in open woodlands, disturbed sites, and along roadsides."
