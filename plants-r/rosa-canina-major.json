    "intro": "Rosa canina major, commonly known as the dog rose, is a species of shrub native to Europe, western Asia, and north Africa. It is characterized by its thorny stems, pinnate leaves, and fragrant pink or white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces aggregate fruits called rose hips, which are rich in vitamin C and contain small seeds. Rosa canina major is often found in hedgerows, woodland edges, and other disturbed habitats. It plays an important role in supporting pollinators and wildlife due to its nectar-rich flowers and nutritious hips."
