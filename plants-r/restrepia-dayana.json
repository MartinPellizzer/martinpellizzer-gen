It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, showy flowers that resemble a slipper, typically in shades of white and pink. The plant produces a single, elongated inflorescence with numerous flowers, each having a pouch-like structure that attracts pollinators. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth. Restrepia dayana is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
