It is characterized by its climbing habit and trifoliate leaves, with each leaflet being ovate to lanceolate in shape. The plant produces small, yellow to orange flowers that are typically borne in clusters. Its fruit is a legume pod containing several seeds, which are often used as a food source. The subspecies is notable for its variability in flower color and leaf morphology, making it a subject of interest in botanical studies."
