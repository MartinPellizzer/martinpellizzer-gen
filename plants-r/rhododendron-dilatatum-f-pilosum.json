    "intro": "Rhododendron dilatatum f. pilosum, commonly known as the hairy alpine rhododendron, is a compact, evergreen shrub characterized by its dense, hairy foliage. It typically grows in high-altitude environments, such as alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant features showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to white, often appearing in clusters. Its leaves are leathery and covered in fine, soft hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh climates. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
