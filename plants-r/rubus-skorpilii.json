    "intro": "Rubus skorpilii, commonly known as the Skorpion bramble, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in rocky and arid environments. The plant is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in spring. Its fruit, a type of edible berry, is often used in local cuisines and traditional medicine. Due to habitat loss, Rubus skorpilii is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
