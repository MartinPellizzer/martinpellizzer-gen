    "intro": "Rosa foetida var. glabrata, commonly known as the stinking rose, is a variant of the stinking rose species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has dark green, glossy leaves and produces rose hips that are typically red or orange in color. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its unique scent and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens despite its somewhat unpleasant odor."
