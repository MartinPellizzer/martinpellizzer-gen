    "intro": "Rhododendron microphyton var. trichanthum, commonly known as the dwarf alpine rhododendron, is a compact evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It features small, leathery leaves that are densely packed, giving it a dense, cushion-like appearance. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, pinkish-white flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in cool, moist, acidic soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
