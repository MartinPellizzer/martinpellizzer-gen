    "intro": "Rosa tomentosa var. alsatica, commonly known as the Alsatian shrub rose, is a perennial shrub native to Europe. It is characterized by its dense, grayish-white fuzzy foliage and clusters of small, fragrant pink flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters and thrives in well-drained soil. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively hardy in temperate climates. The leaves are simple and opposite, with a soft, woolly texture that distinguishes it from other rose species."
