    "intro": "Rulingia prostrata, commonly known as the creeping rulingia, is a low-growing shrub native to the southern Andes of South America. It is characterized by its prostrate or sprawling growth habit, with multiple stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on short pedicels. Its leaves are simple, elliptical, and covered with a dense layer of fine, white hairs. Rulingia prostrata is often found in moist, shaded environments and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
