    "intro": "Ribes, commonly known as gooseberries, are a genus of flowering plants in the family Grossulariaceae. They are shrubs that typically have simple, alternate leaves and produce small, aggregate fruits. The plants are native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and are often found in woodland or mountainous areas. Ribes species are valued for their edible fruits, which are used in jams, jellies, and desserts. They also play an important role in ecological systems by providing food for wildlife."
