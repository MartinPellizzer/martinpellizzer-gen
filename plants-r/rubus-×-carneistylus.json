    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 carneistylus, commonly known as the blackberry-loganberry hybrid, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Rubus ursinus (the blackberry) and Rubus loganobaccus (the loganberry). It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves, typical of the Rubus genus. The plant produces large, dark red to black berries that are often used in jams and desserts. It thrives in temperate climates and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its vigorous growth habit, it is often cultivated as an ornamental or for its edible fruits."
