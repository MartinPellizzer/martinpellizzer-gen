It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and thorny stems, which help it climb and spread across various habitats. The leaves are typically lobed and have a serrated edge, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Its flowers are small and white, producing aggregate fruits that are dark purple to black when mature. This form is often found in coastal areas and moist woodlands, where it thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil."
