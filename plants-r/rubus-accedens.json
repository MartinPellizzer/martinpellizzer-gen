    "intro": "Rubus accedens, commonly known as the coastal blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the coastal regions of North America. It is characterized by its prickly stems and clusters of small, dark purple to black berries. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes and coastal bluffs. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it produces white to pale pink flowers in the spring. The berries are edible, though they are generally small and tart, and are sometimes used in local foraging practices."
