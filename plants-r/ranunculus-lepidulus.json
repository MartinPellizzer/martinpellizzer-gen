    "intro": "Ranunculus lepidulus, commonly known as the sand buttercup, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in spring. Its leaves are deeply lobed and covered in a fine, waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Ranunculus lepidulus is adapted to extreme conditions, making it a resilient species in harsh environments."
