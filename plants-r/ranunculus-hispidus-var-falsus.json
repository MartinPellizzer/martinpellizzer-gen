It features showy, yellow flowers with five to eight sepals that resemble petals, and its leaves are typically trifoliate or palmately compound. The plant thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along streambanks. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which give it its common name. The flowers bloom from late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
