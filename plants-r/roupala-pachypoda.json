    "intro": "Roupala pachypoda, commonly known as the broad-leaved roupala, is a deciduous tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by round, fleshy fruits. Its bark is smooth and pale, with a tendency to flake off as the tree matures. Roupala pachypoda is often found in lowland tropical forests and is valued for its ornamental leaves and ecological importance."
