    "intro": "Rosa canina var. malmundariensis, commonly known as the Malmundar rose, is a lesser-known variant of the dog rose. It is characterized by its pale pink to white flowers, which bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows as a shrub with thorny stems and pinnately compound leaves. Its fruits, known as hip fruits, are similar to those of the common dog rose but may have distinct size or color variations. This variety is often found in specific regions of Europe and is valued for its ornamental and potential medicinal properties."
