It is a shrub characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and compact growth habit. The leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by woody pods containing seeds. This plant is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland regions of southern Australia."
