    "intro": "Rhynchosia villosa, commonly known as the hairy bean, is a climbing legume native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves, which are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces small, yellow flowers followed by pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, known for its nitrogen-fixing abilities through symbiotic bacteria in its root nodules. Rhynchosia villosa is often used in traditional medicine and as a forage plant for livestock."
