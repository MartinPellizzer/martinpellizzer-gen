    "intro": "Rubus amamianus, commonly known as the Amamian blackberry, is a species of brambles native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves, typical of the Rubus genus. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black in color. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and partial shade. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and lesser-known member of the Rubus family."
