    "intro": "Rhamnus agrestis, commonly known as the rough-fruited buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and along riverbanks. The plant has small, elliptical leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs, giving them a rough texture. Its fruit is a small, yellowish drupe that ripens in late summer. Rhamnus agrestis is known for its ability to thrive in harsh environments and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
