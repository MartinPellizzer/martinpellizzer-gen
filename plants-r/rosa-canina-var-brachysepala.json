    "intro": "Rosa canina var. brachysepala, commonly known as the short-sepaled dog rose, is a botanical variant of the dog rose species. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and smaller, more rounded sepals compared to the typical Rosa canina. This variety is native to parts of Asia, particularly in regions of China and the Himalayas. Its flowers are usually pink to white, with a subtle fragrance, and it produces red, hairy hips that are edible. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
