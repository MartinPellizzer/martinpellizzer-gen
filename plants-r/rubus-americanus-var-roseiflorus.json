It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pink flowers in early spring, followed by red, hairy fruits that ripen in the fall. Its botanical features include a woody stem, trifoliate leaves, and a distinctive rose-scented aroma. It is often found in moist woodlands and along stream banks, thriving in partial shade."
