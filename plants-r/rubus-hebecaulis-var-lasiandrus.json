    "intro": "Rubus hebecaulis var. lasiandrus, commonly known as the rough-stemmed blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to parts of North America. It is characterized by its hairy, rough-textured stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically harvested in late summer. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, loamy soils. This variant is often found in woodland edges and disturbed areas, where it spreads through both seeds and vegetative growth."
