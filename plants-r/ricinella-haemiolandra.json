    "intro": "Ricinella haemiolandra, commonly known as the red-flowered ricinella, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves. The plant produces striking pink to red flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators. Its stems are often hairy, and the leaves are usually ovate with a smooth or slightly toothed margin. While not widely cultivated, it is of interest to botanists due to its unique floral structure and ecological role in its native habitat."
