    "intro": "Rubus elongatus var. extensiflorus, commonly known as the broadflower blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to parts of North America. It is characterized by its elongated, thorny stems and large, showy white to pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The leaves are typically compound, with three to five leaflets, and the plant produces edible berries that ripen to a dark purple or black color. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils. This variant is valued both for its ornamental qualities and its fruit, which is used in culinary applications."
