    "intro": "Robiquetia tongaensis, commonly known as the Tonga bellflower, is a flowering plant native to Madagascar. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and often covered with a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. Robiquetia tongaensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
