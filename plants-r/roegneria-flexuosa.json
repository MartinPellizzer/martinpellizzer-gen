    "intro": "Roegneria flexuosa, commonly known as the slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers. It is characterized by its ability to form dense, mat-like growth patterns, which help stabilize soil. Roegneria flexuosa is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and maintaining soil health."
