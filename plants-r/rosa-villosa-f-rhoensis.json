It features silvery-white, fuzzy foliage that gives it its distinctive appearance, and its flowers are typically pale pink to white, with five petals. The plant produces small, red hips that are edible and often used in traditional medicine. It is well adapted to harsh, arid environments and thrives in full sun with well-drained soil. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
