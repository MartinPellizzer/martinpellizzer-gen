It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of pink to white. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories. Its leaves are leathery and elliptical, with a deep green color that provides a striking contrast to its floral display. This variant is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens with appropriate soil and climate conditions."
