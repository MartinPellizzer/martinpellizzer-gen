It is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Ruehssia suffruticosa is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its ecological role in its native habitat."
