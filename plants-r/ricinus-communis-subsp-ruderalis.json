It is a herbaceous annual plant characterized by its palmate leaves and spiny calyces. The plant produces distinctive spiny capsules that contain toxic seeds, which are used in traditional medicine and industry. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in urban environments. Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and potentially hazardous."
