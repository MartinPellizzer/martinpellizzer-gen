    "intro": "Rhododendron spinuliferum, commonly known as the spinyl leaf rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia, particularly in China and Nepal. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and requires partial to full shade for optimal growth. Its leaves are typically leathery and covered with small, stiff hairs, giving them a distinctive textured appearance. Rhododendron spinuliferum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to add vibrant color to shaded garden spaces."
