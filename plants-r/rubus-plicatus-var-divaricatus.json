    "intro": "Rubus plicatus var. divaricatus, commonly known as the prickly raspberry, is a species of bramble native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red when ripe, though they are not typically eaten by humans. It thrives in moist, wooded areas and is often found in the understory of forests. This variety is closely related to other Rubus species and is known for its vigorous growth and ability to form dense thickets."
