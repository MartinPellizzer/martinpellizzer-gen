    "intro": "Rosa micrantha var. drinensis, commonly known as the Drin River rose, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in late spring. The plant features dark green, serrated leaves and thorny stems, typical of many rose species. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a temperate climate with adequate sunlight. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
