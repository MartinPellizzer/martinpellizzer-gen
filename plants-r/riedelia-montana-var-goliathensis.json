    "intro": "Riedelia montana var. goliathensis, commonly known as the Goliath's riedelia, is a rare and striking member of the Acanthaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of South America, particularly in Ecuador and Peru, where it thrives in high-altitude environments. The plant is characterized by its large, velvety leaves and showy, tubular flowers that range in color from deep red to violet. It is often found growing in rocky or gravelly soils, adapting well to harsh, high-altitude conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
