    "intro": "Rubus tomentosus var. genuinus, commonly known as the woolly blackberry, is a shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its dense, white-tomentose (hairy) foliage and stems, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black when mature. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
