    "intro": "Retama monosperma, commonly known as the white retama, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer seasons. The plant has compound leaves composed of several oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain a single seed each. Retama monosperma is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for rocky or arid environments. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and use in landscaping in regions with a warm, dry climate."
