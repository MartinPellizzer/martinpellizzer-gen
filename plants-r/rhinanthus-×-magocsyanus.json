    "intro": "Rhinanthus \u00d7 magocsyanus, commonly known as the Hungarian yellow rattle, is a hybrid plant species native to the Carpathian Basin. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its presence is often an indicator of nutrient-rich, well-drained environments."
