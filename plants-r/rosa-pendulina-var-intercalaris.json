    "intro": "Rosa pendulina var. intercalaris, commonly known as the climbing pink, is a hybrid rose species characterized by its vigorous climbing habit and fragrant, semi-double pink flowers. It originates from a cross between Rosa pendulina and Rosa centifolia, resulting in a plant that combines the ornamental qualities of both parents. The leaves are dark green, glossy, and serrated, providing a lush backdrop to the blooms. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. This variety is prized for its ornamental value in gardens and as a climber for trellises and fences."
