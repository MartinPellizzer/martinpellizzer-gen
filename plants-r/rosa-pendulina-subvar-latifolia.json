    "intro": "Rosa pendulina subvar. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf weeping rose, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its long, arching stems that cascade with clusters of fragrant, pink flowers in early summer. The leaves are broad, ovate, and have a slightly serrated edge, providing a lush green backdrop to the blooms. This variety thrives in partial to full sun and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. It is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to create a dramatic, flowing visual effect."
