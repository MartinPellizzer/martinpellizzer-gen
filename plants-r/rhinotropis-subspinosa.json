    "intro": "Rhinotropis subspinosa, commonly known as the spiny rhinoflower, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It features a compact, bushy growth habit with small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has rough, spiny stems and leaves, which help it retain water in its harsh environment. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from deep underground. Rhinotropis subspinosa is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited to xerophytic conditions."
