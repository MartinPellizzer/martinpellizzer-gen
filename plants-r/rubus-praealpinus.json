It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, dark red to black berries. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it produces white to pale yellow flowers in the spring. This hardy plant is adapted to cold climates and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats."
