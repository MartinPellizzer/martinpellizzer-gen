    "intro": "Rhipsalis trigonoides, commonly known as the three-angled mistletoe cactus, is a climbing cactus native to Central and South America. It features slender, branching stems covered in small, hairless areoles, which are characteristic of the Cactaceae family. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the rainy season. Its fruits are small, fleshy berries that contain seeds dispersed by birds. This species is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its attractive appearance and ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
