    "intro": "Rhus sinuata var. effusa, commonly known as the smooth sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and have serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in panicles, followed by red, fuzzy berries that are a distinctive feature. Its bark is smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age, and it thrives in full sun to partial shade. The plant is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to tolerate various soil conditions."
