It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on top and pale underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by black, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds and mammals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or forested habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and natural landscapes."
