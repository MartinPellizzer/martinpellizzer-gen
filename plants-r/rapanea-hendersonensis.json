    "intro": "Rapanea hendersonensis, commonly known as Henderson's inkberry, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae. It is native to the island of Henderson in the Pitcairn Islands, where it grows in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves and small, clustered white flowers. It produces small, red berries that are edible but not particularly palatable. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Rapanea hendersonensis is considered a rare and endangered species."
