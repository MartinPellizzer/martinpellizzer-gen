    "intro": "Rennera limnophila, commonly known as the water lily of the genus Rennera, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of South America. It is characterized by its floating leaves and showy, white or pink flowers that bloom above the water surface. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and lakes. Its leaves are typically broad and rounded, with a waxy surface to repel water. The flowers are short-lived, opening in the morning and closing by midday, which is a common trait among many water lilies."
