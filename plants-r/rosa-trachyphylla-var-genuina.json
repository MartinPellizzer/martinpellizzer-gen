It is characterized by its thick, woody stems covered in short, stiff hairs. The plant produces fragrant, pink to white flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets with serrated edges. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in colder climates."
