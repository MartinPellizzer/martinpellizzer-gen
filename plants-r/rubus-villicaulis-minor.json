    "intro": "Rubus villicaulis minor, commonly known as the slender blackberry. It is a shrub native to the western United States, characterized by its thorny stems and small, aggregate fruits. The plant produces dark purple to black berries that are typically edible, though they are often overshadowed by more commercially valuable blackberry species. Its leaves are trifoliate, with finely toothed margins, and the plant thrives in well-drained soils. It plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing food for birds and small mammals."
