    "intro": "Racosperma minutifolium, commonly known as the small-leaved acacia, is a shrub native to Australia. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often arranged in pairs along the stems. The plant produces yellow flowers in compact, globular clusters, which are typical of the Acacia genus. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in sandy or gravelly habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in landscaping for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
