    "intro": "Rophostemon, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. The plants are characterized by their aromatic leaves and small, tubular flowers that often have a reddish or purple hue. Rophostemon species are typically shrubs or small trees, with bark that can be smooth or fissured. They are valued for their hard, durable wood, which has been used historically in construction and crafting."
