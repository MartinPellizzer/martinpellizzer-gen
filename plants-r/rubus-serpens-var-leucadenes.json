    "intro": "Rubus serpens var. leucadenes, commonly known as the white-fruited blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and thorny stems, typical of the Rubus genus. The leaves are trifoliate, with serrated margins, and the plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers. Its fruits are aggregate berries, typically smaller and less flavorful compared to common blackberries. This variety is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage and unique fruit color."
