    "intro": "Rubus silvaticus var. koslensis, commonly known as the Koslen raspberry, is a variant of the brambles native to East Asia. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and thorny stems, typical of the Rubus genus. The plant produces aggregate fruits composed of small, drupe-like berries, which are usually red when mature. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated margins, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. This species is valued for both its ornamental qualities and its potential use in traditional herbal medicine."
