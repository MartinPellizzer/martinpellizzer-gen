    "intro": "Rubus arduennensis var. chietinus, commonly known as the Chieti raspberry, is a variant of the bramble genus Rubus native to the Apennine region of Italy. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and the production of small, aggregate fruits that are typically red when mature. The plant features trifoliate leaves with serrated margins and thorny stems, typical of many Rubus species. It thrives in woodland and shrubland habitats, preferring moist, well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and locally significant species in its native range."
