    "intro": "Roegneria angusta, commonly known as narrowleaf wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and compact growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny grains, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or rocky habitats. Roegneria angusta is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in restoration ecology projects."
