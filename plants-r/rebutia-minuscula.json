    "intro": "Rebutia minuscula, commonly known as the miniature rebutia, is a compact cactus native to South America. It features small, rounded stems that are typically green or bluish-green in color. The plant produces vibrant, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, or red during the spring and summer months. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. Due to its low maintenance and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and container cultivation."
