    "intro": "Rhynchosia oreophila, commonly known as the mountain cowpea, is a climbing legume native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its slender stems and trifoliate leaves with small, heart-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are followed by elongated, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. Rhynchosia oreophila is adapted to grow in rocky or mountainous terrain, often in well-drained soils. It is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it useful in agricultural systems."
