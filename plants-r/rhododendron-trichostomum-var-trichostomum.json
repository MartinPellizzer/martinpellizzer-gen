    "intro": "Rhododendron trichostomum var. trichostomum, commonly known as the creeping rhododendron, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It features dense, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and elliptical in shape. The plant produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to red, which bloom in late spring. It prefers acidic, well-drained soils and thrives in partial to full shade. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to form dense ground cover in woodland gardens."
