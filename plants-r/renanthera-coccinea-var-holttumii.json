It is characterized by its vibrant red and orange flowers, which are often adorned with contrasting yellow markings. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, aiding in its survival in humid, shaded environments. The flowers bloom in clusters, making it a striking ornamental plant in cultivation."
