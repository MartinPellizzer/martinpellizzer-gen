    "intro": "Rubus pyramidalis var. umbrosiformis, commonly known as the shadowy raspberry, is a variant of the raspberry plant characterized by its dense, dark foliage that thrives in shaded environments. It produces small, typically red or black berries, similar to other Rubus species, though its fruit may have a slightly different flavor profile. The plant has a shrub-like structure with thorny stems and compound leaves, typical of the Rubus genus. It is often found in forest understories where it benefits from the reduced light conditions. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological studies and horticultural cultivation in shaded gardens."
