    "intro": "Ranunculus aggregatus, commonly known as the clustered buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features delicate, yellow flowers with 5-15 petals, typically arranged in a cup-like shape, and is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves. The plant grows in rocky or alpine habitats, often at high elevations, and is adapted to cold climates. Its foliage is usually deeply lobed, and it produces small, greenish-brown seed capsules that release tiny seeds when mature. Ranunculus aggregatus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
