    "intro": "Ridleyandra kelantanensis, commonly known as the Kelantan ridge fern, is a rare and endemic fern species found exclusively in the mountainous regions of Peninsular Malaysia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, upright fronds with a serrated margin. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically on rocky slopes or in forest undergrowth. Its spores are dispersed through wind, and it plays a vital role in the ecological balance of its native habitat. Due to habitat destruction, Ridleyandra kelantanensis is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
