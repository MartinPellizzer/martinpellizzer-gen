    "intro": "Rosa pomifera subvar. gaudinii, commonly known as the Gaudin's rose, is a rare and distinctive subvariety native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its large, apple-like fruits, which are technically known as rose hips and can grow up to 5 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces showy, pink to red flowers in the spring, followed by the development of its unique, fleshy fruits. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets, and the plant is typically shrub-like in growth habit. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
