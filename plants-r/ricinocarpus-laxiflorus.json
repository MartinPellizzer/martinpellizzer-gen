    "intro": "Ricinocarpus laxiflorus, commonly known as the slender-flowered ricin tree, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a medium-sized evergreen tree that can grow up to 20 meters tall, characterized by its smooth, greyish-brown bark and simple, alternate leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by woody, spiny fruits containing toxic seeds. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and the presence of ricin, a potent toxin found in its seeds."
