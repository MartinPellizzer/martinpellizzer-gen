    "intro": "Ranunculus duciformis, commonly known as the dwarf buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, riverbanks, and woodland edges. The plant features simple, alternate leaves that are usually lobed or divided, and it produces showy, yellow flowers with five petals. Its flowers are actinomorphic, meaning they are radially symmetrical, and are often accompanied by numerous stamens. The species is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its bright, cheerful blooms."
