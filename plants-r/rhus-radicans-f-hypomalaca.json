    "intro": "Rhus radicans f. hypomalaca, commonly known as the smooth sumac, is a variant of the staghorn sumac characterized by its smooth, hairless leaves and stems. It is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States, typically found in moist, open woodlands and streambanks. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in cone-like clusters, which are followed by red, fuzzy berries that attract birds and other wildlife. Its leaves are alternate, with a serrated margin, and the plant is known for its adaptability to various soil types. The smooth sumac is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in partial shade."
