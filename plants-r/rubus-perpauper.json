    "intro": "Rubus perpauper, commonly known as the poor raspberry, is a species of bramble native to western North America. It is a shrub that typically grows in dry, rocky habitats, often in mountainous regions. The plant produces small, usually red or yellow fruits that are edible but not as commonly cultivated as other raspberries. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a serrated margin, typical of many Rubus species. The plant is characterized by its slender stems and small, clustered flowers that bloom in early summer."
