    "intro": "Rhus magalismontana subsp. trifoliolata, commonly known as the three-leaf sumac, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, typically consisting of three leaflets, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in catkins, followed by red, fuzzy berries that are a food source for birds. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in chaparral and desert scrub habitats. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
