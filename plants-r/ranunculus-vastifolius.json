    "intro": "Ranunculus vastifolius, commonly known as the broad-leaved buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features basal leaves that are broadly ovate to heart-shaped, with a waxy coating and serrated edges. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with five petals and numerous stamens, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and stream banks. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
