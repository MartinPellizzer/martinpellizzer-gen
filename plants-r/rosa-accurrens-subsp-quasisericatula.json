    "intro": "Rosa accurrens subsp. quasisericatula, commonly known as the silky-stemmed wild rose, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in late spring. The leaves are pinnately compound, with ovate to elliptic leaflets that have a slightly serrated margin. Its fruits are red, aggregate berries that mature in the fall, and the plant is adapted to moist, woodland habitats. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
