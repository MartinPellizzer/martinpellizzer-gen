It is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between blackberries (Rubus fruticosus) and raspberries (Rubus idaeus). This species exhibits characteristics of both parent plants, including thorny stems and aggregate fruits. The leaves are typically trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the flowers are pink to white in color. It is often cultivated for its edible berries, which have a flavor profile combining elements of both blackberries and raspberries."
