    "intro": "Rosa tomentella var. subsimplex, commonly known as the woolly rose or the simple-haired rose, is a species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, white tomentose (fuzzy) foliage and pink to red flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in open woodlands or along streambanks. Its leaves are simple, with a rounded or ovate shape, and the stems are covered in a thick layer of fine hairs. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique texture and color."
