    "intro": "Ranunculus natans, commonly known as the floating buttercup, is a water-dwelling plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers and floating leaves that rest on the surface of still or slow-moving water. The plant's rhizomes grow beneath the water, anchoring it in muddy substrates. Its flowers typically bloom from May to August, and it plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms. However, it is considered invasive in some regions, outcompeting native plants."
