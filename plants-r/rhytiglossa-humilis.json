    "intro": "Rhytiglossa humilis, commonly known as the dwarf rhytiglossa, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in rocky or mountainous terrain. Its flowers are small and white, arranged in umbels, and it produces small, oval seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Rhytiglossa humilis is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
