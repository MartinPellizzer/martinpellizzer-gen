    "intro": "Rubus obscurus proles decorus, commonly known as the elegant blackberry shrub, is a species of bramble native to the temperate regions of eastern North America. It is characterized by its woody stems, which are covered in fine, hooked prickles, and its compound leaves that are typically trifoliate or pinnate. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are edible and often used in culinary applications. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and showy flowers that bloom in early spring."
