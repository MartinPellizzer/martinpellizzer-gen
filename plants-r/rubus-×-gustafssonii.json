    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 gustafssonii, commonly known as the blackberry\u2013raspberry hybrid, is a deciduous shrub belonging to the Rosaceae family. It is a natural cross between Rubus ursinus (blackberry) and Rubus idaeus (raspberry), resulting in a plant that exhibits characteristics of both parents. The plant produces aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black in color, with a sweet and tart flavor. It thrives in temperate climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Due to its hybrid nature, it is often cultivated for its edible fruits and ornamental value."
