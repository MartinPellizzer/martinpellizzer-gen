It is characterized by its delicate, thread-like stems that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom during the rainy season, followed by red, fleshy fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees in tropical forests. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated as a houseplant."
