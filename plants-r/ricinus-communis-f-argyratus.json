    "intro": "Ricinus communis f. argyratus, commonly known as the silverleaf castor, is a varietal form of the castor oil plant. It is characterized by its striking silvery-white variegation on the foliage, which contrasts with its deep green veins. The leaves are large, palmately lobed, and often have a velvety texture. It produces spiny capsules that contain toxic seeds, similar to the parent species. This cultivar is often grown as an ornamental plant for its unique and attractive leaf patterns."
