    "intro": "Rubus negatus, commonly known as the blackberry bush, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits known as drupes, which are typically dark purple to black in color. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland areas or along the edges of forests. Rubus negatus is valued both for its edible fruits and its role in supporting local wildlife."
