    "intro": "Rosa elliptica var. froedei, commonly known as the Froede's elliptical rose, is a compact shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically glossy and dark green, with a slightly serrated edge. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, semi-double pink flowers in the spring, which gradually fade to a lighter shade. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and ease of cultivation in garden settings."
