    "intro": "Riedelia longirostra, commonly known as the long-beaked riedelia, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from red to purple. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, often in cloud forest environments. Its elongated, narrow leaves are adapted to reduce water loss in its arid or semi-arid habitat. Riedelia longirostra is valued for its ornamental appeal and is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens."
