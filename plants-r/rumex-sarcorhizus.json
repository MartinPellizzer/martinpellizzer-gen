    "intro": "Rumex sarcorhizus, commonly known as broad-leaved dock, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by reddish-brown seeds. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in wetlands, riverbanks, and disturbed areas. Rumex sarcorhizus is also known for its medicinal properties, historically used to treat skin conditions and as a diuretic."
