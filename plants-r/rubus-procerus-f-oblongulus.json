    "intro": "Rubus procerus f. oblongulus, commonly known as the oblongleaf blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its elongated, elliptical leaves that are typically larger than those of the typical Rubus procerus. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are edible and often used in jams and desserts. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. This subspecies is valued for both its ornamental appeal and its fruit yield."
