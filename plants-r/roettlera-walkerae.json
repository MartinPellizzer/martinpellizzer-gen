    "intro": "Roettlera walkerae, commonly known as the Walkerae roettlera, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from purple to pink. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and has lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Roettlera walkerae is considered a species of conservation concern."
