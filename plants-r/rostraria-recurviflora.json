    "intro": "Rostraria recurviflora, commonly known as the spiral orchid, is a rare and distinctive orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique spiral arrangement of leaves, which gives it its common name. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with a complex structure typical of orchids. Rostraria recurviflora thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a threatened species in its native range."
