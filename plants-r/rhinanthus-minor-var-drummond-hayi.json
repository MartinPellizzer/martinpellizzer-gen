    "intro": "Rhinanthus minor var. drummond-hayi, commonly known as the Drummond's yellow-rattle, is a flowering plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is typically found in grasslands and open habitats, often in association with grasses and other herbaceous plants. Its ecological role includes supporting pollinators and contributing to the biodiversity of its native environment."
