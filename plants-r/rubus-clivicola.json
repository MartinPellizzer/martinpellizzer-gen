    "intro": "Rubus clivicola, commonly known as the cliff raspberry, is a species of brambles native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is a shrub that typically grows on rocky slopes and cliffs, where it thrives in well-drained, acidic soils. The plant produces small, edible berries that are similar in appearance to other raspberry species but are often less commonly cultivated. Its thorny stems and dense growth habit make it an important component of alpine and subalpine ecosystems. Rubus clivicola plays a role in supporting local wildlife, including birds and insects, by providing food and shelter."
