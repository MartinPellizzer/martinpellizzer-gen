    "intro": "Rubus lumnitzeri, commonly known as the Lumnitzer blackberry, is a species of bramble native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Rubus genus, which includes many shrubs with edible fruits. The plant is characterized by its prickly stems, trifoliate leaves, and small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black in color. It thrives in moist, temperate climates and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and potential for cultivation, it has been introduced to other regions outside its native range."
