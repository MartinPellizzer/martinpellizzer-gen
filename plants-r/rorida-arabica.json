    "intro": "Rorida arabica, commonly known as the Arabian coffee plant, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the highlands of Yemen and Saudi Arabia. It thrives in tropical climates with high altitudes, moderate temperatures, and well-drained soil. The plant produces small, red berries containing two seeds, which are the beans used for coffee. Rorida arabica is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and compact growth habit. It is highly sensitive to environmental conditions, making it a challenging crop to cultivate outside its native range."
