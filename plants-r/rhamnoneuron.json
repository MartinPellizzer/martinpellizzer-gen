    "intro": "Rhamnoneuron, commonly known as the white ant plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its unique morphological features, including its specialized structures that mimic ant colonies, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plants typically have a woody base with a dense covering of short, stiff hairs. Rhamnoneuron species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Asia. They are often found in moist, shaded environments and are valued for their ornamental appearance and ecological significance."
