It features upright stems with thorn-like branches and lance-shaped, dark green leaves that turn reddish in autumn. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by edible berries that range in color from yellow to red. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its attractive foliage and seasonal blooms."
