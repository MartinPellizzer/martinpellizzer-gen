    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 collinus var. hybridus, commonly known as the hybrid blackberry. This plant is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Rubus ursinus (the blackberry) and Rubus chamaemorus (the cloudberry). It exhibits characteristics of both parent species, including thorny stems and aggregate fruits. The leaves are typically trifoliate with serrated edges, and the flowers are white with five petals. It is often found in temperate regions where both parent species naturally occur."
