    "intro": "Rubia dolichophylla var. kalshirica, commonly known as the Kalshirica balm of Gilead, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes many species of shrubs and herbs. The plant is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters, and bloom during the summer months. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
