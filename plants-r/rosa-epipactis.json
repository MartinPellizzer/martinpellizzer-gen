    "intro": "Rosa epipactis, commonly known as the common epipactis, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rosaceae. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, calcareous soils, often found in meadows and woodland edges. The plant features simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a serrated margin. Its flowers are small, pinkish-white, and arranged in a dense cluster, producing a subtle fragrance. The fruit is a follicle that releases seeds through a specialized mechanism, aiding in its dispersal."
