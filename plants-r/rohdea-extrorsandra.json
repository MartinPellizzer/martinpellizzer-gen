    "intro": "Rohdea extrorsandra, commonly known as the oriental lily or rohdea, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Southeast Asia. It features strap-like, dark green leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces striking, showy inflorescences with white or pale pink flowers that bloom in spring. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense clumps. Rohdea extrorsandra is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and delicate floral display."
