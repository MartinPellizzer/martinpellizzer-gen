    "intro": "Rhipsalis radicans var. ensiformis, commonly known as the sword leaf mistletoe, is a climbing epiphytic plant native to tropical regions of South America. It features long, slender stems that can trail or climb, often forming dense, cascading foliage. The leaves are narrow, sword-shaped, and typically measure up to 10 centimeters in length. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded, humid environments. It produces small, white flowers followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for some animals but toxic to others."
