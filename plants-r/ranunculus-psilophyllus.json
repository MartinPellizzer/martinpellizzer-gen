    "intro": "Ranunculus psilophyllus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features delicate, nodding flowers with five sepals that are typically yellow or orange in color. The plant has finely divided, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain environments."
