    "intro": "Rosa glauca var. wippraensis, commonly known as the Wippra rose, is a rare and delicate species native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It is characterized by its pale blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, gray-green leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery bloom. It thrives in well-drained, alkaline soils and requires a sunny to partially shaded location. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
