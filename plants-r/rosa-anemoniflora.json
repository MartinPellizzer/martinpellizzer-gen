    "intro": "Rosa anemoniflora, commonly known as the anemone-flowered rose, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, white to pale pink flowers that resemble those of the anemone, hence its common name. The plant typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, with slender, arching stems and large, lobed leaves. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, producing a showy display that attracts pollinators. Rosa anemoniflora is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens for its beauty and fragrance."
