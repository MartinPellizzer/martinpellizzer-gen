    "intro": "Rapuntium luteum, commonly known as the yellow buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers, which typically bloom in early spring. The plant has a basal rosette of heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs. Its roots are tuberous and can produce edible tubers, though they are often bitter. The yellow buttercup is often found in moist meadows and along stream banks, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
