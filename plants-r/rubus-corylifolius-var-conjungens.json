    "intro": "Rubus corylifolius var. conjungens, commonly known as Chinese blackberry, is a variant of the bramble plant native to East Asia. It is characterized by its large, lobed leaves and clusters of small, dark red berries. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and thorny stems. It thrives in temperate climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Its berries are edible but typically used in traditional Chinese medicine rather than culinary applications."
