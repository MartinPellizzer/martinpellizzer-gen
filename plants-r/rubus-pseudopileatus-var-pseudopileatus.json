    "intro": "Rubus pseudopileatus var. pseudopileatus, commonly known as the alpine bramble, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant produces edible berries that are typically red or black in color, though they are often overshadowed by the plant's hardy, woody structure. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to high-altitude conditions. The leaves are usually trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the plant is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes."
