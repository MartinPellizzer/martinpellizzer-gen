    "intro": "Rhus falcata, commonly known as the winged sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and have a distinctive wing-like appearance on the leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring, followed by red, fuzzy fruits that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds. Rhus falcata thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or along roadsides. Its botanical features make it an important component of native plant ecosystems and a subject of interest in botanical studies."
