    "intro": "Ricinus medius, commonly known as the middle castor oil plant, is a species native to parts of Africa and the Middle East. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in cyathia, typical of the genus Ricinus. Its seeds, similar to those of Ricinus communis, contain toxic compounds and have been used historically in traditional medicine. However, due to its toxicity, it is not widely cultivated for commercial purposes."
