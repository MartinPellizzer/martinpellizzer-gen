    "intro": "Rubus opacus subsp. nobilissimus, commonly known as the noble blackberry, is a subspecies of the blackberry plant native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is characterized by its dark, almost black, fruits that are typically larger and more flavorful than those of its relatives. The plant has thorny stems and compound leaves with three to five leaflets. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. This subspecies is valued for both its ornamental appeal and its edible berries, making it a popular choice for cultivation in gardens and small-scale farms."
