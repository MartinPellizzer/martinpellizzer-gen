    "intro": "Rhytiglossa pectoralis, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, thriving in well-drained environments. The plant features linear, grass-like leaves and produces showy, spurred orchid flowers in shades of pink and white. It is often found in open habitats such as cliffs, slopes, and along coastal areas. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in many parts of its range."
