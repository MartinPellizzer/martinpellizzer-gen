    "intro": "Relbunium noxium, commonly known as the midnight bellflower, is a rare and enigmatic plant species native to the high altitudes of the Andes. It is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers that bloom only under moonlight, a unique adaptation to its nocturnal pollination strategy. The plant possesses a compact, herbaceous growth form with silver-green foliage that reflects ambient light. Its flowers emit a faint, sweet scent that attracts specific nocturnal pollinators such as moths and bats. Due to its limited habitat and fragile ecosystem, Relbunium noxium is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
