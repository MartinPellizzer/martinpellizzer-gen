    "intro": "Rubus serpens var. gratiflorens, commonly known as the sweetflower blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to parts of North America. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and the production of small, edible berries. The plant features trifoliate leaves with serrated edges and produces white to pale pink flowers that bloom in the spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or wetland habitats. The fruit is typically smaller than standard blackberries and has a milder, sweeter flavor."
