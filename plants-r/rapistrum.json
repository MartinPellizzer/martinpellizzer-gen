    "intro": "Rapistrum, commonly known as wild mustard, is a genus of flowering plants in the mustard family, Brassicaceae. It consists of several species, many of which are native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. These plants typically have alternate, pinnately lobed leaves and produce small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes. The fruits are usually pods that contain several seeds, which are often dispersed by wind. Rapistrum species are often found in disturbed soils and can be invasive in some regions."
