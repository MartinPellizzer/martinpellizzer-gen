It is a compact shrub with dense, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and requires partial to full shade for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value and unique appearance, it is often cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
