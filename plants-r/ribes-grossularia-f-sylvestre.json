It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows in woodland edges, hedgerows, and moist soils. The plant produces small, yellowish-green berries that are edible but often tart and acidic. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are woody and have thorn-like projections.
