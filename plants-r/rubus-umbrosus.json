    "intro": "Rubus umbrosus, commonly known as the shadowy blackberry. It is a species of bramble that thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in woodlands and thickets. The plant produces dark purple to black berries that are typically small and have a tart flavor. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and its stems are covered in fine, prickly hairs. The botanical features of Rubus umbrosus make it well adapted to low-light conditions, contributing to its ecological niche in forest understories."
