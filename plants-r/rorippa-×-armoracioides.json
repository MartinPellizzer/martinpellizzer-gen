    "intro": "Rorippa \u00d7 armoracioides, commonly known as the hybrid yellow water-cress, is a member of the Brassicaceae family. It is a herbaceous annual or biennial plant characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, alternate leaves. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in clusters, typically in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils along stream banks, ponds, and wet meadows. Due to its hybrid origin, it exhibits a mix of traits from its parent species, Rorippa sardoa and Rorippa islandica."
