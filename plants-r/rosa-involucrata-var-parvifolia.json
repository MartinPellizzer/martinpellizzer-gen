    "intro": "Rosa involucrata var. parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved rose, is a compact shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features narrow, elliptical leaves with a slightly hairy surface, and its flowers are typically pink to red, blooming in early summer. The plant is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and is well adapted to harsh, arid environments. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. The small leaves and compact growth habit make it suitable for rock gardens and small spaces."
