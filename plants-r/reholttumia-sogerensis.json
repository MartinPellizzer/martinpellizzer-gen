It is characterized by its distinctive foliage, which features broad, lance-shaped leaves with a waxy texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in temperate forest understories. Due to its restricted habitat and low population numbers, it is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts."
