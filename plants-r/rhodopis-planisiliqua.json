    "intro": "Rhodopis planisiliqua, commonly known as the flat-silvery orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its slender stems and small, pale violet or silvery-blue flowers that bloom during the cooler months. The plant prefers well-drained, rocky soils and requires a cool, humid environment to thrive. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often covered in a fine, silvery coating that helps reflect sunlight. Due to its limited habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, Rhodopis planisiliqua is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
