    "intro": "Ricinus communis var. caesius, commonly known as the purple castor oil plant, is a striking variant of the castor oil plant characterized by its vibrant purple bracts. It is a flowering plant native to tropical regions and belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family. The plant produces distinctive spiny capsules that contain toxic seeds, which are used in traditional medicine and as a source of castor oil. Its ornamental value comes from its showy, colorful bracts that attract pollinators. The plant thrives in warm climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
