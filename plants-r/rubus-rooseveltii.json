It is characterized by its thorny stems, trifoliate leaves, and edible, dark purple berries. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and streambanks. Its flowers are white and have five petals, typical of the Rubus genus. The berries are often used in culinary applications, though they are generally smaller and less sweet than other blackberry varieties."
