    "intro": "Rhynchospora prolifera, commonly known as the spreading marsh sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has slender, triangular stems that are often reddish in color and bear small, spike-like clusters of tiny, greenish-white flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a smooth, waxy surface that helps it retain moisture. Rhynchospora prolifera plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wetland organisms."
