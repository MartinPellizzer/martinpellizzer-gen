    "intro": "Roscoea australis, commonly known as the Australian rose-ginger, is a rhizomatous herbaceous perennial native to New Zealand. It features striking, sword-shaped leaves that are dark green and often have a reddish tint along the edges. The plant produces showy, pale yellow to orange flowers arranged in a spike, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Roscoea australis thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for shady garden areas. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its unique foliage and delicate floral display."
