    "intro": "Roystonea elata, commonly known as the royal palm, is a tall, slender palm native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and large, fan-shaped leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into clusters of dark blue or black berries. It thrives in warm, tropical climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The trunk is often used in construction and as a source of thatch due to its durability."
