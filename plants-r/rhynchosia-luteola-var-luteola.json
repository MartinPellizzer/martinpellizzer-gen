    "intro": "Rhynchosia luteola var. luteola, commonly known as the yellow cowpea, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and parts of Asia. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect growth habit and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that give way to elongated, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It is often cultivated for its edible seeds, which are rich in protein and nutrients. Additionally, it plays a role in soil enrichment due to its nitrogen-fixing ability."
