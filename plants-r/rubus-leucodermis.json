    "intro": "Rubus leucodermis, commonly known as the white-skinned blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its pale-colored stems and leaves, which distinguish it from other Rubus species. The plant produces small, dark berries that are typically less flavorful compared to other blackberries. It thrives in moist, wooded areas and is often found in the understory of deciduous forests. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is of interest to botanists and ecologists studying native plant communities."
