    "intro": "Rubus gonzaloi, commonly known as the Gonzalo raspberry, is a species of bramble native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and produces small, edible berries that are typically red or yellow in color. The plant features compound leaves with serrated edges and produces white to pink flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and partial shade. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and less-studied species within the Rubus genus."
