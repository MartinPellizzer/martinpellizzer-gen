    "intro": "Rubus micans var. pallidulus, commonly known as the pale-flowered blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to parts of eastern North America. It is characterized by its slender, thorny stems and small, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in the spring. The leaves are typically trifoliate, with a slightly hairy texture, and the plant produces small, dark purple berries in the summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or along stream banks. This variant is less commonly cultivated than other blackberry species but is valued for its ornamental appeal and wild habitat significance."
