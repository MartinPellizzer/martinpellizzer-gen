    "intro": "Rochelia lappula, commonly known as the hairy bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, branching stems and small, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms. The plant is typically found in freshwater environments such as ponds and ditches, where it can float or anchor itself to submerged surfaces. Its leaves are usually simple and may have a waxy coating, aiding in buoyancy. The flowers are small and often pale purple or white, with a distinctive two-lipped structure typical of the family."
