    "intro": "Ranunculus dusenii, commonly known as the Dusen's buttercup, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family, characterized by its showy, often brightly colored flowers. The plant typically features compound leaves with lobed or serrated edges, and its flowers have five to eight petals that are usually yellow or white. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
