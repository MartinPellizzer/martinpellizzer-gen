    "intro": "Rhodococcum vitis-idaea, commonly known as the crowberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub belonging to the family Ericaceae. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, dark blue to black berries that are typically edible. The plant thrives in acidic, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in boreal and subarctic regions. Its leaves are typically leathery and evergreen, contributing to its ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions. The flowers are usually white or pale pink, and the plant plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats."
