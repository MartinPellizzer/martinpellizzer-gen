    "intro": "Rhus lentiscifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leafed sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 5 to 7 pairs of elliptical leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in panicles, followed by red, fuzzy fruits that are edible for birds and some mammals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. The plant has a rough, bark-like stem and is often used in traditional medicine for its astringent properties."
