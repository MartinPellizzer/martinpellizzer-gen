    "intro": "Ranunculus diminutus, commonly known as the lesser celandine, is a small perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features delicate, buttercup-like yellow flowers with 5 to 15 petals, and its leaves are deeply lobed with a distinctive waxy coating. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, often forming dense colonies. While it is considered an early spring bloomer, it can become invasive in some regions if not managed properly."
