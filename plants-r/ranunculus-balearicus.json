    "intro": "Ranunculus balearicus, commonly known as the Balearic buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Balearic Islands. It features a basal rosette of sharply lobed, waxy leaves that are typically green with a reddish or purplish tinge. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with five petals and numerous stamens, which bloom in spring. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in coastal areas and meadows. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and protected species in its native habitat."
