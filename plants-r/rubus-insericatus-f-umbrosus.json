    "intro": "Rubus insericatus f. umbrosus, commonly known as the dark-fruited blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant characterized by its dense, hairy growth and dark, almost black berries. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is native to parts of Asia, particularly China. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories, where it thrives in partial to full shade. Its leaves are usually ovate with a serrated margin, and the flowers are small, white, and clustered in the axils of the leaves. The fruit, which ripens in late summer, is valued for its intense flavor and is often used in jams and desserts."
