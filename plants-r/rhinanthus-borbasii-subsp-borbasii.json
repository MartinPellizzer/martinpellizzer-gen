    "intro": "Rhinanthus borbasii subsp. borbasii, commonly known as the Borbas's common tickseed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. This subspecies is native to southern Europe and is typically found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It produces bright yellow flowers in clusters, which attract various pollinators like bees and butterflies. The plant is relatively short-lived, with a lifespan of about two to three years."
