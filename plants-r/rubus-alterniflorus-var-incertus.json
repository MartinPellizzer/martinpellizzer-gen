    "intro": "Rubus alterniflorus var. incertus, commonly known as the uncertain alternate-flowered blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry genus characterized by its unique floral and foliar structures. It typically features alternate leaf arrangement and small, clustered flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces edible berries that are similar in taste and texture to other Rubus species, though they may vary in size and color. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland areas or along the edges of thickets. Due to its limited distribution and taxonomic uncertainty, it is a subject of ongoing botanical study."
