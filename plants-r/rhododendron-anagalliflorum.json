It features dense, evergreen foliage that turns bronze in the fall, and it produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to purple. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils and thrives in partial to full shade. It is often found in woodlands and along stream banks, where it contributes to the biodiversity of its habitat. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardeners seeking native plant species."
