    "intro": "Rubus bogotensis, commonly known as the Bogot\u00e1 raspberry, is a species of bramble native to the high Andes of Colombia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, edible berries that ripen to a deep red color. The plant typically grows in moist, high-altitude environments, often in cloud forests or grasslands. Its leaves are palmately compound, with serrated edges, and its flowers are white with five petals. The fruit is valued for its tart flavor and is sometimes used in local culinary traditions."
