    "intro": "Rubus topitzii, commonly known as the Topitzii blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and produces small, dark purple to black berries. The plant features compound leaves with three to five leaflets, and its flowers are typically white or pale pink. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and lesser-known member of the Rubus genus."
