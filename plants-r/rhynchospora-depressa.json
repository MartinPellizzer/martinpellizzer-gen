    "intro": "Rhynchospora depressa, commonly known as the flatleaf beakgrass, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically forms dense clumps of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are often clustered at the tips of the stems. It thrives in wet or moist environments, such as marshes and wet meadows, and is native to parts of North America. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
