It is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist meadows and along riverbanks, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are opposite and lance-shaped, often with a slightly serrated edge. Roterbe campestris is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in supporting local pollinator populations."
