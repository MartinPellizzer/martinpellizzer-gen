It is a shrub that typically grows in rocky or open habitats, often in mountainous regions. The plant features compound leaves with white to pale green undersides, which distinguish it from other rose species. Its flowers are usually pale pink to white, and it produces hips that are edible but less commonly consumed by humans. This variety is notable for its ornamental value and adaptability to harsh environments."
