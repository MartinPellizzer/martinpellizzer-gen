    "intro": "Rubus masseyi, commonly known as the Massey's blackberry, is a species of bramble native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and produces dark purple to black berries that are typically small and somewhat tart. The plant has compound leaves with serrated edges and produces white to pale yellow flowers in the spring. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
