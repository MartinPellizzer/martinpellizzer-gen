    "intro": "Rhynchosia hagenbeckii, commonly known as the Hagenbeck's burr legume, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its distinctive pod-like fruits that encase the seeds. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, featuring compound leaves and showy, butterfly-shaped flowers. Its seeds are encased in a hairy, spiny pod that aids in seed dispersal by attaching to animal fur or clothing. Rhynchosia hagenbeckii is often found in disturbed habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role."
