    "intro": "Resinanthus orbicularis, commonly known as the orbicular resin bush, is a shrub native to the subtropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, spherical growth habit and small, waxy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of resin. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by small, spherical fruits. Its resinous secretions have been historically used in traditional medicine and as a natural adhesive. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local insect populations."
