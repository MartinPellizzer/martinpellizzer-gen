    "intro": "Rubus rivularis var. orbicularis, commonly known as the broad-leaf blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to parts of Asia and the Americas. It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves and small, aggregate fruits that ripen to a dark purple or black color. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its stems are often thorny, and the leaves are covered in fine hairs. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and edible fruit, though it is less commonly cultivated than other blackberry species."
