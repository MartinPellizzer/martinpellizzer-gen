It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows up to 2 meters tall, with opposite, ovate leaves that have a velvety texture. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink to purple, which bloom in clusters along the stems. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. Rungia ciliata is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along riverbanks."
