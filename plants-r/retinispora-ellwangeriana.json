    "intro": "Retinispora ellwangeriana, commonly known as the golden mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus Ficus. It has small, ovate leaves that are usually covered in a dense layer of white, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by fleshy, berry-like fruits that are an important food source for birds. Retinispora ellwangeriana is native to tropical regions of South America and is often found in humid, shaded environments within rainforests. Its parasitic nature allows it to obtain water and nutrients from its host, while it also contributes to the ecological dynamics of its habitat through seed dispersal by animals."
