    "intro": "Ranunculus trachyticus, commonly known as the rough buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It features palmately divided, bright yellow flowers with a distinctive rough, hairy texture on its petals. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and thrives in alpine or subalpine environments. Its leaves are deeply lobed and covered in fine, glandular hairs, contributing to its characteristic appearance. Ranunculus trachyticus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often found in wildflower gardens and naturalized areas."
