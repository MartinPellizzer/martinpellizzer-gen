    "intro": "Rubus horridus var. menkei, commonly known as the Menke's bramble, is a deciduous shrub native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits known as drupes, which are typically red or black in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or hedgerow environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions."
