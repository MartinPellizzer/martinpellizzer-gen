    "intro": "Rodriguezia fragrans, commonly known as the sweet-scented rodriguezia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, showy bracts that resemble petals, which are often mistaken for actual flowers. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, releasing a sweet, spicy aroma. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of rainforests. Rodriguezia fragrans is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its potential medicinal properties."
