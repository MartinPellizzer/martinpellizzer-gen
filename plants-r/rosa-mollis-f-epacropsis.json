    "intro": "Rosa mollis f. epacropsis, commonly known as the soft rose or woolly rose, is a cultivar of the Rosa mollis species, which is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and clusters of fragrant, semi-double pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows as a shrub, reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters, and is well-suited for rock gardens or as a border plant due to its compact form. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. This cultivar is prized for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of garden settings."
