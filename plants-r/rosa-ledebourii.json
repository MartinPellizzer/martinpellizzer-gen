    "intro": "[WRONG START] Rosa ledeburii, commonly known as the desert rose or the Cape rose, is a species of flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, characterized by its dense, thorny stems and small, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, pink or red flowers that bloom in spring, adding vibrant color to its harsh habitat. Rosa ledeburii is adapted to survive in low-water conditions, making it a resilient plant in its native range. Its unique appearance and hardiness have made it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in dry climates."
