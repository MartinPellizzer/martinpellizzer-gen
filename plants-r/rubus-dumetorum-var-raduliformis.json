    "intro": "Rubus dumetorum var. raduliformis, commonly known as the blackberry bramble, is a variant of the Rubus genus native to temperate regions. It is characterized by its dense, thorny growth habit and dark green, trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that ripen to a deep purple or black color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or hedgerows. Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and a common weed in agricultural settings."
