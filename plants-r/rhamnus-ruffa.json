    "intro": "Rhamnus ruffa, commonly known as the roughleaf buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in rocky or dry soils and is characterized by its dark green, rough-textured leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are followed by black, egg-shaped berries. Rhamnus ruffa is often found in coastal areas and can thrive in full sun to partial shade. Its berries are a food source for birds and other wildlife, contributing to its ecological significance."
