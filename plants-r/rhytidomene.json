    "intro": "Rhytidomene, commonly known as the \"skeletonflower,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its unique, papery, and often wrinkled leaves that give it its common name. The flowers are typically small and clustered, with five petals that are often colored in shades of pink or white. Rhytidomene species are native to southern Africa, where they grow in dry, rocky habitats. These plants are adapted to arid conditions, with deep root systems and reduced leaf surfaces to minimize water loss."
