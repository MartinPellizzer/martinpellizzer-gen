    "intro": "Ranunculus crassitruncus, commonly known as the thick-stemmed buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It features basal leaves that are palmately lobed and often covered in a dense layer of silky hairs. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with five to nine petals, typically appearing in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along streambanks. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens but is also considered a weed in some agricultural settings."
