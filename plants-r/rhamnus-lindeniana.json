    "intro": "Rhamnus lindeniana, commonly known as the Lindenside buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It typically grows to a height of 6 to 15 feet and features smooth, gray bark that becomes fissured with age. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by elliptical, dark blue berries that are edible for birds. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and along stream banks. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
