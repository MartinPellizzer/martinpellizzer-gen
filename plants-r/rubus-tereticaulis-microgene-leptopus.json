    "intro": "Rubus tereticaulis microgene leptopus, commonly known as the slender blackberry, is a species of bramble native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, thornless stems and small, clustered flowers that range from white to pale pink. The plant produces small, edible berries that are typically dark red to black in color. It thrives in moist, woodland habitats and is often found in shaded areas with rich, organic soil. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
