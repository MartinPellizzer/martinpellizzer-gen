    "intro": "Regelia chlorosticta, commonly known as the silver-stemmed regelia, is a striking member of the Acanthaceae family native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that are covered in a dense layer of white, waxy hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Regelia chlorosticta thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot."
