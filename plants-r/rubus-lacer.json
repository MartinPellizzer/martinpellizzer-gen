It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, usually white or pinkish flowers. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or black when mature. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including woodlands, hedgerows, and disturbed soils. Due to its hardy nature, it is often considered a weed in agricultural areas."
