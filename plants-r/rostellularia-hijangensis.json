    "intro": "Rostellularia hijangensis, commonly known as the Hijang orchid, is a rare species of orchid native to the Philippines. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique floral structure and compact growth habit. The plant typically features a short rhizome with a few pseudobulbs, and its leaves are linear and arranged in a rosette pattern. The flowers are small, fragrant, and usually have a distinct coloration, often with a yellow or greenish hue. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Rostellularia hijangensis is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
