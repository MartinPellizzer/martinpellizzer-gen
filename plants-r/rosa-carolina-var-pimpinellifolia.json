    "intro": "Rosa carolina var. pimpinellifolia, commonly known as the Carolina rose or sweet wild rose, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, arching stems and small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces edible rose hips, which are rich in vitamin C and often used in culinary applications. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a serrated margin, typical of many rose species. This variety is well adapted to woodland and open habitats, thriving in partial shade to full sun."
