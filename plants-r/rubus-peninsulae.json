    "intro": "Rubus peninsulae, commonly known as the Peninsula raspberry, is a species of bramble native to the coastal regions of southern Korea. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and produces small, edible berries that are typically red when ripe. The plant has compound leaves with serrated edges and produces white flowers in the spring. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in moist, coastal habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
