    "intro": "Rossioglossum ampliatum, commonly known as the giant orchid, is a striking tropical plant native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The plant features a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, enabling it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are broad and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), providing structural support and reducing water loss. Rossioglossum ampliatum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is a symbol of rarity in the orchid world."
