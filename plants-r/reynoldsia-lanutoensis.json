    "intro": "Reynoldsia lanutoensis, commonly known as the Lanutoan fern, is a rare and unique plant species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on rocky surfaces or in the canopies of tropical forests. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing capsules, are typically found on the undersides of its leaves. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Reynoldsia lanutoensis is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
