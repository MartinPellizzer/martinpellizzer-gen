    "intro": "Restio festuciformis, commonly known as the grass-like restio, is a species of flowering plant in the family Restionaceae. It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it grows in coastal and inland regions. The plant is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, clustered inflorescences. It typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes or near the edges of fynbos vegetation. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value."
