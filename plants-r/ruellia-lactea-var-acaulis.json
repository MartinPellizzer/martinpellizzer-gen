It is characterized by its lack of a distinct stem, with leaves directly emerging from the roots. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale purple flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and covered in fine, silky hairs. Ruellia lactea var. acaulis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments."
