    "intro": "Rumex thjanschanicus, commonly known as the Karakorum sorrel, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of dark green, rhombic leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are typically borne on slender, erect stems. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
