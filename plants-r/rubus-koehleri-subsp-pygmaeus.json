    "intro": "Rubus koehleri subsp. pygmaeus, commonly known as the dwarf blackberry, is a small shrub native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, thorny growth and small, dark berries that mature in late summer. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and its flowers are white with five petals. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
