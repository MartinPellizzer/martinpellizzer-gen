It is characterized by its basal rosette of large, wavy, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces tall, reddish stems bearing clusters of small, greenish flowers in the spring. Its leaves are edible and have been used in traditional cuisine and medicine. Rumex amplexicaulis thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks."
