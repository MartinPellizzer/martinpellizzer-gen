    "intro": "Rosa coriifolia var. subulata, commonly known as the needle-leaved shrub rose, is a compact, deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its slender, needle-like leaves that give it a unique, almost fern-like appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant pink or white flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. Its ornamental value lies in its delicate foliage and blooms, which add a refined touch to garden landscapes."
