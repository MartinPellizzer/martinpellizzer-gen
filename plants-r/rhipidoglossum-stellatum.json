    "intro": "Rhipidoglossum stellatum, commonly known as the star-tongue fern, is a striking member of the Dryopteridaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that feature a central, elongated vein with radiating, star-like pinnae, giving it its common name. Native to the mountainous regions of South America, this fern thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are wiry and form dense colonies, contributing to its ornamental appeal in gardens. The plant's botanical features make it a valuable addition to botanical collections and a subject of interest in plant taxonomy."
