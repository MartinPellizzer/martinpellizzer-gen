It features small, fragrant pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has dark green, glossy foliage that remains attractive throughout the growing season. It is well adapted to coastal climates and is drought-tolerant once established. This cultivar is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardy nature and ornamental value."
