    "intro": "Rosa glaucopubescens, commonly known as the glaucous-hairy rose, is a species of shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and small, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or white. The plant's leaves are compound, with serrated edges and a hairy texture that gives it its common name. Its flowers are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological significance. Rosa glaucopubescens is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
