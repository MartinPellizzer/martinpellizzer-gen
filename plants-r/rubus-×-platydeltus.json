    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 platydeltus, commonly known as the evergreen blackberry. It is a hybrid shrub native to the coastal regions of California and Oregon, characterized by its dense, thorny stems and dark green, leathery leaves. The plant produces small, black berries that are typically harvested in late summer, though they are not as widely cultivated as other Rubus species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal scrub and chaparral habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in landscaping for erosion control and as a decorative plant."
