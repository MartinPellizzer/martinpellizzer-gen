    "intro": "Rumex macropterus, commonly known as the large-leaf dock, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It features basal leaves that are large, heart-shaped, and often covered with a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in dense clusters during the spring and summer months. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a common weed in disturbed soils. The leaves and stems are often used in traditional medicine for their purported astringent and anti-inflammatory properties."
