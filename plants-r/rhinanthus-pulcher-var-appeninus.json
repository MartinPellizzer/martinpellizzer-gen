    "intro": "Rhinanthus pulcher var. appeninus, commonly known as the Italian red brome, is a flowering plant belonging to the grass family Poaceae. It is characterized by its bright red or orange inflorescence, which is often mistaken for a flower but is actually a spikelet cluster. The plant typically grows in sunny, open habitats such as meadows and grasslands, and it is native to southern Europe. Its slender, erect stems are usually less than 30 cm tall, and the leaves are narrow and grass-like. This variety is of interest in botanical studies due to its distinctive coloration and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
