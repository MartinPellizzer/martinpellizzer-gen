    "intro": "Rauwenhoffia oligocarpa, commonly known as the golden bell tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish-brown bark and large, palmately lobed leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces striking, bell-shaped flowers that are yellow with red veins, which bloom in clusters during the dry season. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. Rauwenhoffia oligocarpa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
