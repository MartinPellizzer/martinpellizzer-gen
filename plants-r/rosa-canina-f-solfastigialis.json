    "intro": "Rosa canina f. solfastigialis, commonly known as the pale-stemmed dog rose, is a botanical variant of the common dog rose. It is characterized by its pale pink to white flowers and distinctive, often pale-colored stems. This subspecies is typically found in open habitats such as heaths and grasslands, where it thrives in sunny conditions. Its leaves are compound, with five to seven leaflets, and it produces hips that are smaller and less showy than those of the typical dog rose. The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in horticulture."
