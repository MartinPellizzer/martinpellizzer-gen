    "intro": "Rorippa sublyrata f. obtusula, commonly known as the broad-leaved watercress, is a variant of the watercress species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves and small white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in moist or aquatic environments, often found along stream banks and in wet meadows. Its leaves are edible and have a peppery flavor similar to other watercress varieties. This form is notable for its distinct leaf morphology compared to the typical form of Rorippa sublyrata."
