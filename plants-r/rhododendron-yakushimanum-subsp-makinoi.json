    "intro": "Rhododendron yakushimanum subsp. makinoi, commonly known as the Shikoku azalea, is a compact evergreen shrub native to Japan. It features dense, dark green foliage and produces showy clusters of pink to reddish-purple flowers in early spring. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters and thrives in acidic, well-drained soil. It is well-suited for rock gardens and woodland settings due to its compact growth habit. The subspecies is characterized by its smaller, more rounded leaves compared to the typical form of R. yakushimanum."
