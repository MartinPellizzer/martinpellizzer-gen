    "intro": "Restrepia sanguinea, commonly known as the red-flowered restrepia, is a species of orchid native to the high Andes of South America. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen rhizome and its striking, deep red or purple flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or mountainous habitats, where it forms dense colonies. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, often forming a rosette shape around the rhizome. Restrepia sanguinea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in cool, humid environments."
