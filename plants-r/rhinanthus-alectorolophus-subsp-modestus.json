    "intro": "Rhinanthus alectorolophus subsp. modestus, commonly known as the modest common tickseed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges, often in disturbed soils. Its flowers are yellow and tubular, arranged in spikes, and bloom from June to August. It plays a role in supporting pollinators and is of interest in ecological and conservation studies."
