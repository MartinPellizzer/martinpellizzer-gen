    "intro": "Rubus degenianus, commonly known as the Degen's blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or forested habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species within its range."
