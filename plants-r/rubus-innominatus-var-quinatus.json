    "intro": "Rubus innominatus var. quinatus, commonly known as the five-lobed blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dark purple to black berries, which are typically small and have a distinctive five-lobed calyx. The plant produces compound leaves with three to five leaflets, and its thorny stems are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. The fruit is edible, though it has a tart flavor and is sometimes used in jams or wines."
