    "intro": "Ruehssia rupestris, commonly known as the rock rue, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is a small, evergreen shrub that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white or yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Ruehssia rupestris is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
