    "intro": "Ranunculus aquatilis var. fissifolius, commonly known as the fissile water crowfoot, is a aquatic plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in shallow freshwater habitats such as ponds, streams, and wet meadows. The plant features finely divided, feather-like leaves that float on the water surface or emerge from the water. Its flowers are usually yellow with five petals and are borne on short stalks above the water. This variant is distinguished by its deeply lobed leaves, which give it its scientific name \"fissifolius,\" meaning \"split leaf.\""
