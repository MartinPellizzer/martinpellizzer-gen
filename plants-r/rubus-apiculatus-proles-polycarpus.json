    "intro": "Rubus apiculatus proles polycarpus, commonly known as the polycarpic raspberry, is a species of bramble native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its prickly stems and aggregate fruits, which are composed of multiple small drupelets. The plant typically grows in moist, shady woodlands and thrives in temperate climates. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, and they bloom in early summer. This species is notable for its ability to produce multiple crops of fruit throughout the growing season due to its polycarpic nature."
