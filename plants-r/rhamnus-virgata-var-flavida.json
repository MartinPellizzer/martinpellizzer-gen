    "intro": "Rhamnus virgata var. flavida, commonly known as the yellow-fruited buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, woody stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in spring, followed by orange to yellow berries that are edible for certain bird species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. The leaves and fruits contain anthraquinones, which have been used in traditional medicine for their laxative properties."
