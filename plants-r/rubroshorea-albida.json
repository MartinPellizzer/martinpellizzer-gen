    "intro": "Rubroshorea albida, commonly known as the white-flowered shorea, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and large, lance-shaped leaves that are typically light green in color. The plant produces small, white flowers arranged in clusters, which are highly fragrant and attract various pollinators. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release winged seeds, aiding in wind dispersal. Rubroshorea albida is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a landscape plant."
