    "intro": "Rubus nemorosus var. tomentosus, commonly known as the downy bramble, is a shrub belonging to the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its hairy, or tomentose, stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, edible berries in the summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. This variety is notable for its ornamental value and ecological importance as a food source for birds and small mammals."
