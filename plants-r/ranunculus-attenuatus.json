    "intro": "Ranunculus attenuatus, commonly known as the slender buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features delicate, yellow flowers with five petals and a hairy, yellow center, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks. Ranunculus attenuatus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
