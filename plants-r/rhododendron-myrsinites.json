    "intro": "Rhododendron myrsinites, commonly known as the creeping rhododendron, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It features dense, dark green foliage with a waxy coating, and its flowers are typically pink to red, appearing in clusters along the stems. The plant thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to form thick, ground-covering mats in suitable conditions."
