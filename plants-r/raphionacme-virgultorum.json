    "intro": "Raphionacme virgultorum, commonly known as the silverleaf dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a low-growing perennial with basal rosettes of silvery, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by fluffy white seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Its leaves are characterized by their serrated edges and a distinctive silvery-gray underside. Raphionacme virgultorum is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and woodland edges."
