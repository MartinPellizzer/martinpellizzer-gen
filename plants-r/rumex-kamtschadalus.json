    "intro": "Rumex kamtschadalus, commonly known as Kamtschatka sorrel, is a perennial herb native to the high altitudes of the Russian Far East and parts of Alaska. It features upright stems covered in fine hairs and lance-shaped leaves that are often reddish in color. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in hue. Its leaves are edible and have a tangy, sour flavor due to the presence of oxalic acid. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky areas."
