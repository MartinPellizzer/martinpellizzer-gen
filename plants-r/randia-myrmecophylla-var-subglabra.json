    "intro": "Randia myrmecophylla var. subglabra, commonly known as the smooth-leaved randia, is a species native to tropical regions of South America. It is a shrub characterized by its simple, opposite, and smooth leaves that are usually lanceolate in shape. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its leaves are adapted to support symbiotic relationships with ants, a feature common in the genus Randia. This variety is distinguished by its reduced leaf pubescence compared to other varieties within the species."
