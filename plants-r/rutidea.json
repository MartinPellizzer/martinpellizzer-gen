    "intro": "Rutidea, commonly known as the \"bluebells of the southern hemisphere,\" is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. These plants are characterized by their striking blue or purple bell-shaped flowers, which bloom in spring and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Rutidea species are typically found in temperate and subtropical regions, often in woodland or shrubland habitats. They have compound leaves and produce pods that contain seeds, a common reproductive strategy among legumes. The genus includes several species, some of which are cultivated for their ornamental value in gardens."
