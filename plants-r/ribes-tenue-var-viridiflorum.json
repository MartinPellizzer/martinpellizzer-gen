    "intro": "Ribes tenue var. viridiflorum, commonly known as the greenflower gooseberry, is a variant of the common gooseberry native to North America. It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its slender, arching stems and small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are distinctive for their vibrant coloration. The berries, which ripen in late summer, are edible and have a tart flavor, often used in jams and wines. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, supporting pollinators and wildlife."
