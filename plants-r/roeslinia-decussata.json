It belongs to the family Rosaceae and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and showy, pink or white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or coastal areas. Its leaves are leathery and arranged in a decussate pattern, giving it its scientific name.
