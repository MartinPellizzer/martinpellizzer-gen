    "intro": "Ranunculus amaurophanes, commonly known as the dark-leaved buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, cup-shaped flowers that typically range in color from pale yellow to deep orange. The plant features palmately divided leaves with a dark green hue, often marked by a lighter midrib. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
