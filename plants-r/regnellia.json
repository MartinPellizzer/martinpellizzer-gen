    "intro": "Regnellia, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Primulaceae. It consists of about 10 species, primarily found in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plants are characterized by their showy, bell-shaped flowers that often have a distinctive, almost translucent appearance. Regnellia species typically grow in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Their botanical significance lies in their unique floral structure and ecological role in forest ecosystems."
