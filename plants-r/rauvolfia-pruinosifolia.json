    "intro": "Rauvolfia pruinosifolia, commonly known as the velvetleaf rauvolfia, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Rubiaceae. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy bloom, giving them a velvety texture. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in cymes, and its fruits are capsule-like structures containing minute seeds. Native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia, it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal potential, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and traditional herbal practices."
