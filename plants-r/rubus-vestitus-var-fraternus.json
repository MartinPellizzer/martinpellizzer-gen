    "intro": "Rubus vestitus var. fraternus, commonly known as the fraternus raspberry, is a variant of the raspberry plant native to certain regions of North America. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red when ripe, though some varieties may have a slightly different hue. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges or disturbed soils. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species."
