    "intro": "Rhododendron albiflorum var. warrenii, commonly known as the Warren's alpine rhododendron, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It features broad, leathery leaves that are dark green and densely packed, providing a lush backdrop for its showy white flowers. The blooms, which appear in early spring, are large, funnel-shaped, and often have a subtle fragrance. This variety is well adapted to cold climates and requires well-drained, acidic soil to thrive. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in mountainous gardens."
