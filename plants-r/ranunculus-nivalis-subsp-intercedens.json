    "intro": "Ranunculus nivalis subsp. intercedens, commonly known as the alpine buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It thrives in high-altitude environments, often growing in rocky soils and meadows above the tree line. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with five to eight petal-like sepals, which are typically borne on slender stems. It is adapted to cold climates and has a short growing season, flowering in late spring to early summer. Its botanical features make it a characteristic component of alpine flora, contributing to the ecological diversity of mountain ecosystems."
