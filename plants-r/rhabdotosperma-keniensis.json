It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the daisy family. It is often found in rocky or sandy soils in arid and semi-arid regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
