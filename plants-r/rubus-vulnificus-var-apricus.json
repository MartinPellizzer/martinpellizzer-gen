    "intro": "Rubus vulnificus var. apricus, commonly known as the apricot raspberry, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, pale yellow to orange-red flowers. The plant produces small, edible berries that are similar in taste to both raspberries and apricots, hence its common name. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and stream banks. The species is valued for its ornamental value and as a source of edible fruit in native ecosystems."
