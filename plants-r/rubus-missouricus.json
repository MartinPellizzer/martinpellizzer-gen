    "intro": "Rubus missouricus, commonly known as the Missouri blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the central United States. It is characterized by its thorny stems and aggregate fruits that ripen to a dark purple or black color. The plant typically grows in moist, fertile soils along stream banks and woodland edges. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it produces white to pale pink flowers in the spring. The berries are edible, though often tart, and are used in local foraging and traditional culinary practices."
