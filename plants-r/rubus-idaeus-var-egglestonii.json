It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red when ripe, though some forms may exhibit different colors. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in woodland edges and open fields. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and edible fruits, though it is less commonly cultivated than other raspberry types."
