    "intro": "Rhododendron adenostemonum, commonly known as the Adenostemon Rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats, such as forest understories or rocky slopes. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, while its flowers range in color from white to pink or red. Rhododendron adenostemonum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in cooler climates."
