It features opposite, elliptic to ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a rough texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically clustered in terminal inflorescences. Its fruits are spherical, red berries that contain several seeds. Randia horrida is often found in disturbed soils and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
