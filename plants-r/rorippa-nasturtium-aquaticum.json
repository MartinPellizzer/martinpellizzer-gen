    "intro": "Rorippa nasturtium-aquaticum, commonly known as watercress, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North America. It is an aquatic or semi-aquatic species that thrives in freshwater environments such as ponds, streams, and wetlands. The plant has alternate, heart-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating, with small white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its roots are fibrous and help anchor it in muddy substrates, while its stems can be prostrate or erect depending on the water conditions. Watercress is known for its peppery taste and is often used in salads or as a garnish."
