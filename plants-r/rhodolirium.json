    "intro": "Rhodolirium, commonly known as the flame violet, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are native to Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia and the Philippines, where they thrive in humid, tropical climates. Rhodolirium species are characterized by their striking, showy flowers that often display vibrant red, orange, or yellow hues. The leaves are typically broad and lance-shaped, and the plants often grow as epiphytes or terrestrial herbs. Due to their ornamental value, some species are cultivated in gardens, though they are relatively rare in the horticultural trade."
