    "intro": "Rubus schmidelyanus var. grandifrons, commonly known as the large-fruited blackberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically clustered together on the stems. The plant has compound leaves with serrated edges and thorned stems, typical of the Rubus genus. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, often found in forest understories. The berries are edible, though they are generally less sweet and more tart compared to other blackberry varieties."
