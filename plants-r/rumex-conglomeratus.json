    "intro": "Rumex conglomeratus, commonly known as clustered sorrel, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its upright, branched stems and alternate leaves that are heart-shaped with a serrated margin. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in dense clusters during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are edible but contain oxalic acid, making them somewhat tart and potentially irritant. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas and along stream banks."
