    "intro": "Rhynchosia prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate cowpea, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa, South America, and Southeast Asia. It is a low-growing, herbaceous annual that typically spreads along the ground, forming a dense mat. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are followed by elongated, pod-like fruits containing edible seeds. Its leaves are heart-shaped and often have a hairy texture, while its stems are slender and trailing. Rhynchosia prostrata is valued for its nutritional content and is sometimes cultivated as a forage crop."
