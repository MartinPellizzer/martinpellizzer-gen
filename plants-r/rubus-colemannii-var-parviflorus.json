    "intro": "Rubus colemannii var. parviflorus, commonly known as the small-flowered blackberry shrub, is a perennial species native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its thorny stems and trifoliate leaves, which are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by edible, dark purple berries in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments. Its botanical features make it an important component of local ecosystems and a subject of interest in horticultural studies."
