It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces red, edible berries that are often used in local cuisines. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, loamy soils. Its dense growth habit makes it an effective hedgerow plant and a valuable source of wildlife habitat."
