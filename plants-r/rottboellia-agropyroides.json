    "intro": "Rottboellia agropyroides, commonly known as false brome, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in open areas, such as roadsides and disturbed soils, and is characterized by its tufted growth habit. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to spread rapidly in suitable habitats. Rottboellia agropyroides is often considered an invasive species in some regions due to its competitive growth and adaptability."
