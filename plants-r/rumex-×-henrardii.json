    "intro": "Rumex \u00d7 henrardii, commonly known as the hybrid sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Polygonaceae family. It is a natural hybrid between Rumex acetosa (common sorrel) and Rumex acetobulus (broadleaf sorrel), resulting in a plant with distinctive foliage. The leaves are typically heart-shaped with a reddish or purple tinge on the underside, and the plant produces small, greenish flowers in spikes. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. The plant is valued for its edible leaves, which have a tangy, sour flavor similar to its parent species."
