    "intro": "Rhododendron ovatum var. setuliferum, commonly known as the hairy leaved rhododendron, is a species native to eastern Asia, particularly China. It is characterized by its distinctive, hairy leaves that give it its varietal name \"setuliferum,\" meaning \"bearing hairs.\" The plant produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to red, typically blooming in late spring. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its evergreen foliage and prolonged flowering period."
