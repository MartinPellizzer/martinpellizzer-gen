    "intro": "Rapuntium flaccidum, commonly known as the limp buttercup, is a herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in cultivated fields. The plant features basal leaves that are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, with a yellow flower head composed of numerous small, yellow flowers. It is an annual or biennial species, reaching heights of up to 30 centimeters. Its botanical characteristics make it a common weed in agricultural areas, though it has limited economic importance."
