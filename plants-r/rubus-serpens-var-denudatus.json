    "intro": "Rubus serpens var. denudatus, commonly known as the nakedleaf blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and small, often thornless leaves that are usually hairless or nearly so. The flowers are typically white or pale pink, and the fruit is a small, dark purple to black berry. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its botanical features make it distinct from other Rubus species, particularly in its reduced leaf pubescence."
