    "intro": "Rosa rubiginosa var. floribunda, commonly known as the shrub rose or sweetbriar, is a thorny, deciduous shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features dense, arching stems with small, dark green leaves that are serrated along the edges. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers in spring, which are followed by red-orange hips in autumn. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy ornamental plant. Its historical use in hedging and as a source of edible hips adds to its ecological and cultural significance."
