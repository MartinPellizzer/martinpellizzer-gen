    "intro": "Rubus armeniacus, commonly known as the Armenian raspberry, is a species of bramble native to the Caucasus region. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves, typical of the Rubus genus. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are red when ripe, often used in jams and culinary applications. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges and rocky soils. Botanically, it is distinguished by its five-petaled white flowers and the presence of persistent sepals that remain on the fruit."
