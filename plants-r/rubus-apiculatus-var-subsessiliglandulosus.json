    "intro": "Rubus apiculatus var. subsessiliglandulosus, commonly known as the hairy raspberry. This variant is characterized by its dense, glandular pubescence on both the stems and leaves, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red when mature. It is native to regions of eastern Asia, including China and Japan. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists."
