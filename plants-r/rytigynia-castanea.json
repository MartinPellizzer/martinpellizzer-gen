    "intro": "Rytigynia castanea, commonly known as the Brazilian chestnut, is a species of flowering plant native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit with opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, woody fruits that enclose one or two seeds. Rytigynia castanea is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its foliage rather than its fruit. However, it is not widely used in commercial agriculture due to its limited fruit size and low yield."
