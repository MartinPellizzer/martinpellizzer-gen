    "intro": "Rubus gracilis var. falconeri, commonly known as the Falkland Island raspberry, is a shrub native to the Falkland Islands. It is characterized by its slender, arching stems and small, trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, red, aggregate fruits that are typically eaten by local wildlife. It thrives in coastal grasslands and is adapted to the cool, windy climate of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
