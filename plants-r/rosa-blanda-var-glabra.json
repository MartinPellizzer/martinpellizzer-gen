    "intro": "Rosa blanda var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth woodland rose, is a perennial shrub native to North America. It features slender, arching stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats or small colonies. The plant produces fragrant, semi-double pink flowers with five to seven petals, which bloom in early spring. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered with fine, soft hairs. The smooth woodland rose thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands and stream banks."
