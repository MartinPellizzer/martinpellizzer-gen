    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus subsp. vanneromii, commonly known as the yellow buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features showy, yellow flowers with five to seven petals, typically borne on slender stems above dissected, trifoliate leaves. The plant thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges. Its flowers open in spring and are pollinated primarily by insects such as bees and flies. The subspecies vanneromii is distinguished by its slightly larger flowers and more robust growth compared to the typical form of R. auricomus."
