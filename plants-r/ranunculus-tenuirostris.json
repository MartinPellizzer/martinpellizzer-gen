    "intro": "Ranunculus tenuirostris, commonly known as the narrow-beaked buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks. The plant features delicate, bright yellow flowers with five sepals that resemble petals, and its leaves are palmately divided with a distinctive, hairy texture. It produces small, greenish-yellow fruits that contain several seeds. Ranunculus tenuirostris is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
