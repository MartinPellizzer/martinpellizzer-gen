It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its trailing or climbing growth habit. The plant produces aggregate fruits, known as berries, which are typically dark purple to black in color when mature. Its leaves are palmately compound, with serrated edges and a hairy texture. This species is often found in woodland edges, hedgerows, and disturbed soils, where it thrives in partial shade to full sun."
