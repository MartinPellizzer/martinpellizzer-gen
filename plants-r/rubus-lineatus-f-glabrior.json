    "intro": "Rubus lineatus f. glabrior, commonly known as the smooth-stemmed blackberry, is a variant of the common blackberry characterized by its smoother, less hairy stems compared to the typical form. It is a shrub native to the eastern United States, often found in moist, shaded woodlands and along stream banks. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically less flavorful than those of the common blackberry. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three oval-shaped leaflets, and the plant has thorny stems that provide structural support. Botanically, it is valued for its ornamental qualities and its role in local ecosystems."
