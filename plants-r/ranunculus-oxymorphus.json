    "intro": "Ranunculus oxymorphus, commonly known as the alpine buttercup, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family, characterized by its showy, often yellow or white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, alpine environments where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are palmately divided, and the flowers consist of numerous petal-like sepals. Due to its limited habitat, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
