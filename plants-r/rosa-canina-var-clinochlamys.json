    "intro": "Rosa canina var. clinochlamys, commonly known as the creeping dog rose, is a variant of the dog rose native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a shrub that typically grows in a low, spreading form, often found in woodland edges and hedgerows. The plant produces fragrant, pink flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by orange-red hips that are rich in vitamin C. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with serrated edges, and the stems are covered in hooked prickles. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in herbal medicine."
