    "intro": "Rhododendron litiense, commonly known as the coastal rhododendron, is a flowering plant native to the Pacific coast of North America. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and showy clusters of pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in coastal environments, where it is adapted to salty air and well-drained soils. Its leaves are typically leathery and have a serrated edge, while its flowers are often fragrant. Rhododendron litiense plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for local wildlife."
