    "intro": "Ramaliella acantholimon, commonly known as the stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features fleshy, thick leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, or red, typically during the summer months. Its growth habit is low and compact, often forming dense mats or clusters. Ramaliella acantholimon is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
