    "intro": "Rapanea dependens var. ciliata, commonly known as the hairy-leafed boxwood, is a shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage with leaves that have a distinctive ciliate margin, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens and as a decorative plant in shaded landscapes."
