    "intro": "Rhododendron nudiflorum, commonly known as the nakedflower rhododendron, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are typically hairless or nearly so. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or white, appearing before the leaves in early spring. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Rhododendron nudiflorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its early blooming habit."
