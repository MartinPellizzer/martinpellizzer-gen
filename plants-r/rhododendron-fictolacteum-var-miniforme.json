    "intro": "Rhododendron fictolacteum var. miniforme, commonly known as the dwarf alpine rhododendron, is a compact shrub native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It features dense, leathery foliage with elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained acidic soil. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is cultivated in alpine gardens and rockeries."
