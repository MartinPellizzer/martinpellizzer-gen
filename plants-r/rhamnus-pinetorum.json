    "intro": "Rhamnus pinetorum, commonly known as the pine tree buckthorn, is a shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows to a height of 2\u20136 meters and has dark green, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring, followed by dark red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. The bark is smooth and grayish, with a characteristic fragrance when crushed."
