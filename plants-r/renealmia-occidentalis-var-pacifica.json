    "intro": "Renealmia occidentalis var. pacifica, commonly known as the Pacific renealmia, is a perennial herb native to coastal regions of the Pacific Northwest. It features upright, grass-like foliage with narrow, bluish-green leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers in dense, spike-like inflorescences during the summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded to partially shaded environments. This variant is distinguished by its slightly broader leaves and more compact growth habit compared to the typical form of Renealmia occidentalis."
