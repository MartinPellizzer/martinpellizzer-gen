    "intro": "Ruprechtia carina, commonly known as the mountain holly, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and dense, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers in late spring, followed by bright red berries that are a source of food for birds. Its ornamental value comes from its compact form and seasonal color changes. Ruprechtia carina is often cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
