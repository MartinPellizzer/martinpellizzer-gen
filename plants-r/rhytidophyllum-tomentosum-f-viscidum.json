    "intro": "Rhytidophyllum tomentosum f. viscidum, commonly known as the sticky leaf cycad, is a unique variant of the cycad species characterized by its dense, waxy, and sticky foliage. This plant is native to specific regions in South America, particularly in parts of Brazil, and thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. Its leaves are typically broad and pinnately compound, with a distinctive, velvety texture that gives it its common name. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, as it is a gymnosperm, and it plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat for various insects and small animals. Due to its slow growth and specific environmental requirements, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts."
