It is characterized by its large, rhubarb-like leaves that are typically reddish in color and have a distinctive lobed shape. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in dense clusters during the summer months. Its roots are the primary part used in traditional medicine and are rich in anthraquinone compounds. Rheum lobatum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in gardens for its striking foliage."
