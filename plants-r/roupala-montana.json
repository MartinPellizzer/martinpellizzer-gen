    "intro": "Roupala montana, commonly known as the mountain roupala, is a small evergreen tree native to South America, particularly found in the Andean regions of Peru and Bolivia. It belongs to the family Proteaceae and is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in spherical inflorescences, which bloom in the spring. Roupala montana is adapted to high-altitude environments, often growing in rocky or mountainous terrain. Its wood is valued for its durability and is used in local crafts and construction."
