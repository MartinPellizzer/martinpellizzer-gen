    "intro": "Racosperma undoolyanum, commonly known as the undoolya wattle, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its yellow floral spikes that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in sandy soils and is found in arid and semi-arid regions of Queensland and the Northern Territory. It has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain seeds. This species is often used in ecological restoration due to its ability to stabilize soils and provide habitat for native wildlife."
