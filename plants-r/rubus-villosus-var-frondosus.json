    "intro": "Rubus villosus var. frondosus, commonly known as the softleaf blackberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its finely hairy stems and broad, lobed leaves that are often covered in a soft, woolly texture. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by edible, dark purple berries in the summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and thickets. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and ecologically important species in its native habitat."
