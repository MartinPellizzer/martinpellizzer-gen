It features upright, rhizomatous growth with broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often reddish at the base. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in panicles during the summer months. Its underground stems, or rhizomes, are edible and have a tart flavor similar to common rhubarb.
