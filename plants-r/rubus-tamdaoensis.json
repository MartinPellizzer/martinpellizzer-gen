    "intro": "Rubus tamdaoensis, commonly known as the Tamdao blackberry, is a species of brambles native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically harvested when fully ripe. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and less-studied species within the Rubus genus."
