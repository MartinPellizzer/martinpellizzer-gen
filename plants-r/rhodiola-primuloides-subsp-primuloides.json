    "intro": "Rhodiola primuloides subsp. primuloides, commonly known as the alpine rose or tundra rhodiola, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with fleshy, dark green leaves and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant thrives in cold, arid environments and is often found in alpine tundras and rocky slopes. It possesses a deep root system that allows it to survive in nutrient-poor soils. Rhodiola primuloides subsp. primuloides is also known for its adaptability to harsh climatic conditions and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
