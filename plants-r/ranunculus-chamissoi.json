    "intro": "Ranunculus chamissoi, commonly known as Chamisso's buttercup, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a short, hairy stem that supports its palmate, deeply lobed leaves, which are typically bright green and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with five to seven petals, often accompanied by numerous stamens and a prominent, central pistil. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
