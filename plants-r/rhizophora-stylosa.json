    "intro": "Rhizophora stylosa, commonly known as the mangrove apple or red mangrove, is a salt-tolerant tree native to tropical regions of Asia and the Pacific. It is characterized by its distinctive aerial roots, which help in anchoring the plant and facilitating gas exchange in waterlogged soils. The plant has prop roots that grow downward from its trunk, providing structural support in coastal environments. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The fruit is a small, fleshy drupe that plays a role in seed dispersal by water and animals."
