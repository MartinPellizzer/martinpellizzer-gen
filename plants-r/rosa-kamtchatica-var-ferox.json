    "intro": "Rosa kamtchatica var. ferox, commonly known as the Kamchatka rose, is a rugged, cold-hardy shrub native to the Russian Far East. It features thorny stems and heart-shaped, serrated leaves that are adapted to withstand harsh climates. The plant produces fragrant, pink to reddish-purple flowers in late summer, which are typically borne singly on long pedicels. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience, making it suitable for colder garden environments. Its botanical characteristics reflect its evolutionary adaptation to the extreme conditions of its native habitat."
