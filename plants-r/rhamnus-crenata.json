    "intro": "Rhamnus crenata, commonly known as the smooth buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 10 feet and features opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves with smooth margins. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by dark blue, fleshy berries that are edible for birds and some mammals. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in a variety of soil types, including dry and rocky conditions. Rhamnus crenata is often found in woodlands, thickets, and along stream banks, contributing to local biodiversity."
