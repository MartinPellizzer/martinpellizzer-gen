It features dense, thorny stems covered in a fine, white, woolly layer of hair, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are oval-shaped, glossy, and also bear a similar tomentose covering, contributing to its overall textured look. Its flowers are typically pink or white, with five petals and a fragrant aroma, blooming in spring. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and hardiness in mild climates."
