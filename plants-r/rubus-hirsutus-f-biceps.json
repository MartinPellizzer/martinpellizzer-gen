    "intro": "Rubus hirsutus f. biceps, commonly known as the twin-stemmed blackberry, is a botanical variant of the blackberry plant characterized by its unique growth pattern. It features two distinct stems emerging from the same node, a trait that sets it apart from typical blackberry varieties. The plant produces dark purple to black berries that are typically small and tart. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in hedgerows and woodland edges. Its botanical interest lies in its structural anomaly and potential use in horticultural breeding programs."
