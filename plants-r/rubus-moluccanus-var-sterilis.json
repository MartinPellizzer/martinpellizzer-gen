    "intro": "Rubus moluccanus var. sterilis, commonly known as the sterile raspberry, is a variant of the raspberry plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and aggregate fruits that resemble small, red berries. Unlike its fertile counterparts, this variety is typically seedless, which may be due to genetic or environmental factors. The plant thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland or shrubland habitats. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest in both horticultural and ecological studies."
