    "intro": "Rhus suffruticosa, commonly known as the smooth sumac, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 feet and features compound leaves with 15 to 31 oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in panicles, followed by red, fuzzy berries that are a food source for birds and wildlife. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in disturbed soils along roadsides and in open woodlands. Rhus suffruticosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
