It features compound leaves with three leaflets and produces small, yellow flowers that are followed by elongated, pod-like fruits. The plant is characterized by its fibrous roots and its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, making it beneficial in soil enrichment. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fallow fields. The seeds are typically small and can be dispersed by wind or animals."
