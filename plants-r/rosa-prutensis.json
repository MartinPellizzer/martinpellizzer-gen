It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring thorny stems and pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces fragrant, single or semi-double flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its botanical features include a woody stem with persistent stipules and an aggregate fruit called a hip, which contains several seeds.
