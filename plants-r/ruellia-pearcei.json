It is characterized by its striking blue to violet tubular flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. The plant typically grows as a herbaceous perennial, reaching heights of up to 3 feet, with lance-shaped leaves that are arranged oppositely along the stems. Ruellia pearcei thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening.
