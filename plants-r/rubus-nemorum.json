    "intro": "Rubus nemorum, commonly known as the bird's nest raspberry, is a species of bramble native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a shrub that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and stream sides. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are usually red or yellow in color, which are edible but often tart. Its leaves are trifoliate, with a serrated edge, and the stems are covered in fine, prickly hairs. Rubus nemorum plays an important role in supporting local wildlife, including birds and insects, by providing food and shelter."
