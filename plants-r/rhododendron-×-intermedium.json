    "intro": "Rhododendron \u00d7 intermedium, commonly known as the cross-leaved rhododendron, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Rhododendron catawbiense and Rhododendron maximum. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage with dark green, leathery leaves that are elliptical in shape. The plant produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a reddish tinge. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and ability to bloom reliably in cooler climates."
