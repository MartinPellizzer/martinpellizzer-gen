    "intro": "Rathbunia gummosa f. tortuosa, commonly known as the twisted gum tree, is a variant of the gum tree species native to Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive twisted or contorted branches, which give it a unique and often striking appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by woody, edible pods containing seeds. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, and it is typically found in dry, sandy soils. This ornamental plant is valued for its aesthetic appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unusual form."
