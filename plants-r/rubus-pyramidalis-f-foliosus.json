    "intro": "Rubus pyramidalis f. foliosus, commonly known as the leafy raspberry, is a variant of the raspberry plant characterized by its distinctive foliage. This form exhibits larger, more prominent leaves compared to the typical raspberry, which contributes to its unique appearance. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red when ripe, similar to other Rubus species. It thrives in temperate climates and prefers well-drained soil. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is often cultivated in gardens and small-scale farms."
