It features compact, rounded rosettes of fleshy, blue-gray leaves that store water, adapting to arid environments. The plant produces vibrant orange to red flowers during the summer months, adding visual interest. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements make it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
