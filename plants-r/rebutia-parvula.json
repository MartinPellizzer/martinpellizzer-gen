    "intro": "Rebutia parvula, commonly known as the small cushion cactus, is a compact, low-growing cactus native to the arid regions of South America. It features a dense cluster of short, cylindrical stems that are typically green to bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of yellow, orange, or red during the warmer months. Its shallow root system allows it to thrive in well-draining soil with minimal water. Due to its hardy nature, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
