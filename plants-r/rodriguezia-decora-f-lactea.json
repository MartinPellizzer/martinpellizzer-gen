    "intro": "Rodriguezia decora f. lactea, commonly known as the white-veined rodriguezia, is a striking tropical plant native to Central America. It is characterized by its large, glossy, heart-shaped leaves with prominent white veins that create a striking contrast. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, white flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in humid, warm environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in shaded gardens or as a houseplant."
