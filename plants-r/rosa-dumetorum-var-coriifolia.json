    "intro": "Rosa dumetorum var. coriifolia, commonly known as the silky rose, is a shrub-like plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its finely hairy, silvery-gray leaves that give it a distinctive, almost fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its stems are often covered in a dense layer of fine pubescence, contributing to its ornamental value. This variety is well-suited for rock gardens and dry, sunny environments due to its drought tolerance."
