    "intro": "Rhinactinidia eremophila subsp. tuvinica, commonly known as the Tuvinian sandwort, is a rare flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The species produces small, white or pale pink flowers during the brief growing season. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to extreme temperature fluctuations. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
