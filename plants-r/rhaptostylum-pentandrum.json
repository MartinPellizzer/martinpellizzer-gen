    "intro": "Rhaptostylum pentandrum, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its straight, dark red heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and fine grain. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a smooth surface. Its flowers are small and fragrant, typically appearing in clusters, and it produces small, fleshy fruits. Due to overharvesting, it is now classified as an endangered species in its natural habitat."
