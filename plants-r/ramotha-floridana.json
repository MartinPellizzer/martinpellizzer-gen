    "intro": "Ramotha floridana, commonly known as the Florida ramotha, is a rare flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its striking violet-blue petals and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in shaded forest understories. It blooms in late spring, producing clusters of small, fragrant flowers. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in several states."
