    "intro": "Rumex latifolius, commonly known as broadleaf sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features alternate, broadly ovate to rhomboidal leaves with a distinctive reddish or purple coloration on the veins. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in loose clusters, typically blooming from May to July. Its leaves are edible and have a sour taste due to the presence of oxalic acid. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks."
