It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a contrasting purple or red throat. It typically grows in shaded, humid environments such as forests and along riverbanks. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly hairy texture, contributing to its ornamental appeal."
