It features small, dark green leaves with a slightly hairy texture and produces clusters of yellowish-white flowers in the spring. The plant bears small, fleshy fruits that are typically red or orange when mature. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in chaparral and coastal scrub habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain areas."
