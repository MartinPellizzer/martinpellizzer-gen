    "intro": "Robinsonella pilosa subsp. pilosa, commonly known as the woolly bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant native to freshwater habitats in the Americas. It is characterized by its fleshy, bladder-like structures that trap small organisms, aiding in nutrient absorption. The plant typically grows in shallow, still waters and has submerged, branched stems with small, scale-like leaves. Its flowers are usually yellow or greenish and are borne on short stalks above the water surface. This subspecies is notable for its unique adaptations to aquatic environments and its role in nutrient cycling in freshwater ecosystems."
