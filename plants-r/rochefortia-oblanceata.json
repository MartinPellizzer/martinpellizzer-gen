    "intro": "Rochefortia oblanceata, commonly known as the desert broom, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, featuring woody stems and small, narrow leaves. The plant produces clusters of yellow, tubular flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that help it survive in harsh, dry climates. Rochefortia oblanceata is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
