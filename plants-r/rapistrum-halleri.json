    "intro": "Rapistrum halleri, commonly known as yellow rocket, is a flowering plant in the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers and is native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. It has alternate, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, round pods that contain several seeds. Rapistrum halleri is often considered a weed but has been studied for its potential in phytoremediation due to its ability to accumulate heavy metals."
