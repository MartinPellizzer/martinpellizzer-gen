    "intro": "Rivina mexicana, commonly known as redroot or Mexican ivy, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in cymes, followed by red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for birds. Rivina mexicana is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to various soil types. It is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
