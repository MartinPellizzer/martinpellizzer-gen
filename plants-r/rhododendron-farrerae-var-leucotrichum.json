    "intro": "Rhododendron farrerae var. leucotrichum, commonly known as the white-haired rhododendron, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and clusters of fragrant, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and requires partial to full shade, making it well-suited for woodland gardens. Its unique varietal trait of white trichomes on the leaves gives it a distinctive appearance. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
