    "intro": "Rhynchosia hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy cowpea, is a leguminous plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its hairy stems and trifoliate leaves, which are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that give way to cylindrical, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It is adapted to grow in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions. Rhynchosia hirsuta is also noted for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it a useful plant in agricultural systems."
