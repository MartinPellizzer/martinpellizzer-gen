    "intro": "Rubus trelleckensis, commonly known as the Trelleck blackberry, is a species of bramble native to Wales. It is characterized by its thorny stems and dark purple to black berries that ripen in late summer. The plant typically grows in woodland edges and scrubland, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it produces white flowers in early spring. This species is of particular interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and ecological significance in its native habitat."
