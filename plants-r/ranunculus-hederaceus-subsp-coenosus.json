    "intro": "Ranunculus hederaceus subsp. coenosus, commonly known as the creeping buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its spreading growth habit and glossy, heart-shaped leaves. It produces clusters of bright yellow flowers with five to seven petals, typically blooming in early spring. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia and thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread aggressively, making it both a common weed and a valued ornamental in certain gardens. The species is also notable for its ability to tolerate a range of soil types, though it prefers well-drained, loamy soils."
