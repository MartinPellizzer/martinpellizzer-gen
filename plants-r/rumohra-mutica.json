    "intro": "Rumohra mutica, commonly known as the slender fern, is a species native to South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients. The leaves are usually bipinnate, with a graceful, arching appearance that contributes to its ornamental value."
