    "intro": "Ranunculus bangii, commonly known as the Bangi buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to Southeast Asia. It features showy, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, with prominent yellow stamens. The plant has palmately divided leaves that are typically hairy and have a distinctive, serrated edge. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens but is also threatened by habitat loss in the wild."
