    "intro": "Rubus lanatus, commonly known as the woolly blackberry, is a species of shrub native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and thorny stems, which provide protection against herbivores. The plant produces small, dark berries that are typically harvested when fully ripe. Its leaves are palmately lobed and covered in fine, white pubescence, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Rubus lanatus thrives in temperate climates and is often found in moist, shaded environments."
