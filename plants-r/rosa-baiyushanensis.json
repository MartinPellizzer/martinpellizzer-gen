    "intro": "Rosa baiyushanensis, commonly known as the Baiyushan rose, is a rare species native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its fragrant, pink to red flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has dark green, serrated leaves and produces hip fruits that are orange-red in color. It thrives in cool, humid climates and is often found in forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
