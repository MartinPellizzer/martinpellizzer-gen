It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, rushes, and grass-like plants. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its flowering spikes are usually tall and cylindrical, bearing small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Rhynchospora domingensis plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and providing habitat for various insect and bird species."
