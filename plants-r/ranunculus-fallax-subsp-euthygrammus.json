    "intro": "Ranunculus fallax subsp. euthygrammus, commonly known as the yellow meadow buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks, preferring well-drained soils. The plant features bright yellow flowers with five petals, often with a darker central vein, and hairy stems that are usually branched. Its leaves are palmately divided, with serrated edges, and it produces small, greenish-yellow fruits that are dispersed by wind. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in supporting pollinators in its native habitats."
