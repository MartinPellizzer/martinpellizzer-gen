    "intro": "Rumex brasiliensis, commonly known as Brazilian sorrel, is a perennial herb native to South America. It features erect, branched stems covered with fine hairs and lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, which are typically followed by triangular, spiky fruits. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in forest understories. The leaves are edible and have a tangy, sour flavor due to their high oxalic acid content."
