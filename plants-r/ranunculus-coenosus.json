    "intro": "Ranunculus coenosus, commonly known as the clustered buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features delicate, yellow flowers with five to seven petals, often surrounded by a ring of sepals. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and thrives in shaded to partially shaded environments. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a hairy surface that helps reduce water loss. Ranunculus coenosus is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive spring blooms."
