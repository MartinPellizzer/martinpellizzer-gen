    "intro": "Rhus mexicana, commonly known as the Mexican buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically alternate and pinnately arranged, with serrated margins. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in panicle inflorescences, followed by orange to red berries that are an important food source for wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid landscapes. Rhus mexicana is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
