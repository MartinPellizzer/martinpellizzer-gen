    "intro": "Ranunculus breyninus var. polyanthemoides, commonly known as the Polyanthemous Crowfoot, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features delicate, bright yellow flowers with numerous petals arranged in a cup-like shape, typical of the Ranunculaceae family. The plant has finely divided, trifoliate leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of soft, woolly hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
