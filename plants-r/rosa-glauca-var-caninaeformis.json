    "intro": "Rosa glauca var. caninaeformis, commonly known as the gray rose or coastal rose, is a compact shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California and northern Baja California. It features pale blue to lavender flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has silvery-gray foliage that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. Its stems are covered in fine, stiff hairs, giving it a distinctive, almost fuzzy appearance. This variety is well adapted to coastal conditions, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils."
