    "intro": "Ranunculus flaccidus var. confervoides, commonly known as the sea holly, is a coastal plant adapted to saline and sandy environments. It has slender, sometimes hairy stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are typically divided into lobes and are often covered in a fine layer of salt. This variety is notable for its ability to thrive in harsh maritime conditions. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
