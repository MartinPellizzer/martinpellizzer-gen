    "intro": "Rubus hirtus var. laniger, commonly known as the woolly blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to North America. It is characterized by its dense, white to grayish pubescence covering the stems, leaves, and fruiting structures. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically edible but have a tart flavor. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. The botanical features of this variant make it distinct from other Rubus species, particularly in its hairy appearance and growth habits."
