It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are small, ovate, and covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. It produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are attractive to pollinators such as bees and birds. This plant is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in dry environments."
