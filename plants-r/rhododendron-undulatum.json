    "intro": "Rhododendron undulatum, commonly known as the wavy-leaved rhododendron, is a species native to the Himalayas, particularly in regions of India and Nepal. It is characterized by its large, leathery leaves that have a distinctive wavy or undulating edge, which gives it its common name. The plant produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Rhododendron undulatum is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
