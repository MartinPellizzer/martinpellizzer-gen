    "intro": "Reynoutria multiflora var. hypoleuca, commonly known as the white-flowered Japanese knotweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to East Asia. It features tall, slender stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often with a reddish hue. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in late summer. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread rapidly, making it an invasive species in many regions. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found near rivers, ditches, and woodland edges."
