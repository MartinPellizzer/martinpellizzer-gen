    "intro": "Rubus bifrons var. genuina, commonly known as the Pacific blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to the western coast of North America. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with three to five leaflets. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically sour in taste. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal regions and along streams. Due to its hardiness and adaptability, it is a common species in native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
