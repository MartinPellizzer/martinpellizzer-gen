    "intro": "Rabdosia rugosa, commonly known as the rough-leaved rabdosia, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a rough texture. Its small, tubular flowers are usually violet or purple in color and bloom in clusters. Rabdosia rugosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
