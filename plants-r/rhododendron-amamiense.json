    "intro": "Rhododendron amamiense, commonly known as the Amami rhododendron, is a rare flowering plant native to the Amami Islands in Japan. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in mountainous regions with rich, acidic soil. Its leaves are leathery and elliptical, providing a striking contrast to the delicate blossoms. Due to its limited habitat and threats from deforestation, it is considered an endangered species."
