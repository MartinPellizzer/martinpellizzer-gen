    "intro": "Rhytiglossa axillaris, commonly known as the axillary rhytiglossa, is a flowering plant native to the Andes region of South America. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae, which includes bellflowers, and is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that range in color from white to violet. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and arranged in a basal rosette, while its stems are upright and bear the clusters of flowers. Rhytiglossa axillaris is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
