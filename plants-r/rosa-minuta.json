    "intro": "Rosa minuta, commonly known as the dwarf rose or miniature rose, is a compact shrub native to the western United States. It features small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. The plant has dark green, serrated leaves and produces rose-like blooms throughout the summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Due to its small size and ornamental value, it is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal in gardens."
