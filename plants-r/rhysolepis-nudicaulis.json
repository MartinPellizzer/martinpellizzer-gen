It is characterized by its slender, hairless stems and clusters of blue to purple bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky slopes. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Rhysolepis nudicaulis is a member of the Campanulaceae family, known for its showy, bell-like flowers."
