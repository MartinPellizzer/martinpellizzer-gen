    "intro": "Rhamnus dumetorum var. crenoserrata, commonly known as the roughleaf buckthorn, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, thorny growth and small, oval leaves with a distinctive crenate-serrate margin. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by dark blue, egg-shaped berries. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal and scrubland habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions."
