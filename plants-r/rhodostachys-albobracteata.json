It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Malaysia and Indonesia. The plant is characterized by its large, showy flowers that are typically pink or red, surrounded by white bracts that give it its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Its ornamental value makes it a sought-after plant in horticulture, though it is relatively rare in cultivation."
