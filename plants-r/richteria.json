    "intro": "Richteria, commonly known as the \"golden saxifrage,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Polygonaceae. These plants are characterized by their basal rosettes of leaves and showy, often yellow or orange, flowers that bloom in the summer. Richteria species are typically found in rocky or alpine environments, where they thrive in well-drained soils. They are native to regions in North America and are often adapted to harsh, cold climates. The genus includes several species, such as Richteria glauca and Richteria hirta, which are valued for their ornamental appeal and ecological resilience."
