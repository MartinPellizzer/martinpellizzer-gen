    "intro": "Rubus petitianus, commonly known as the Petitian blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically harvested in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species within its native habitat."
