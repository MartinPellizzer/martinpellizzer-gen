    "intro": "Rhus copallinum var. obtusifolia, commonly known as smooth sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and have rounded or bluntly pointed leaflets. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by red, fuzzy berries that persist into the winter. Its bark is smooth and grayish, becoming fissured with age, and it is often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils. Smooth sumac is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions."
