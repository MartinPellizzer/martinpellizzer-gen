    "intro": "Rhaphithamnus coriaceus, commonly known as the roughleaf thornybush, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it conserve water in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruits are small, dry capsules that contain several seeds. Rhaphithamnus coriaceus is adapted to grow in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland semi-desert regions."
