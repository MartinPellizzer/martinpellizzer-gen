    "intro": "Rosa \u00d7 dumetorum var. seticaulis, commonly known as the creeping rose, is a low-growing shrub characterized by its dense, thorny stems that often lie close to the ground. Its leaves are typically compound, consisting of five to seven elliptical leaflets with serrated edges. The plant produces small, pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is native to parts of Europe and is often found in rocky or disturbed soils. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as a ground cover or in hedgerows."
