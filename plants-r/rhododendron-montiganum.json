    "intro": "Rhododendron montiganum, commonly known as the Alpine rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows at high elevations, often in rocky or alpine habitats. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or red, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are leathery and elliptical, providing a dense canopy that helps protect the plant from harsh weather conditions. Rhododendron montiganum is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural environment."
