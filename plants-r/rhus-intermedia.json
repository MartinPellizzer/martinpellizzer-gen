    "intro": "Rhus intermedia, commonly known as smooth sumac, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and turn vibrant red in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in cone-like clusters, followed by red, fuzzy berries that are a food source for birds. Smooth sumac thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or along roadsides. It has historical uses in traditional medicine and as a source of dye."
