    "intro": "Rosa speciosa, commonly known as the showy pink rose, is a species of flowering plant native to western North America. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring thorny stems and opposite leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces large, showy flowers that range in color from white to deep pink, often with a distinctive red or purple hue at the base. Rosa speciosa blooms in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens, though it requires well-drained soil and full sun to thrive."
