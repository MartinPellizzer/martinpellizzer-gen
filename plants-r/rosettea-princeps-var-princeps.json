    "intro": "Rosettea princeps var. princeps, commonly known as the royal hibiscus, is a striking tropical plant characterized by its large, showy flowers and distinctive rosette-like arrangement of leaves. Native to the Caribbean, it thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. The plant's leaves are typically broad and waxy, with a deep green color, while its flowers range from pink to red, often with a contrasting white or yellow center. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a houseplant. Due to its specific care requirements, it is considered a relatively challenging plant for novice gardeners."
