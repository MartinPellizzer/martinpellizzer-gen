It is characterized by its dense, grayish-white pubescence covering the stems and leaves, giving it a distinctive woolly appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal and resilience."
