    "intro": "Rhaphidorhynchus rohlfsianus, commonly known as the Rohlfsian sea hare, is a species of sea slug belonging to the family Aplysiidae. It is characterized by its elongated, soft body and lack of a shell, typical of many nudibranchs. The plant, or rather the animal, exhibits a range of color variations, often including shades of green, brown, and orange. It is primarily found in marine environments, particularly in the Indo-Pacific region. Rhaphidorhynchus rohlfsianus plays a role in marine ecosystems as both a herbivore and a prey species."
