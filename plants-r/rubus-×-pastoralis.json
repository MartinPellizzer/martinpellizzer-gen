    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 pastoralis, commonly known as the everbearing blackberry, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Rubus ursinus (the blackberry) and Rubus chamaemorus (the cloudberry). It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and the production of small, dark berries that ripen throughout the growing season. The plant thrives in temperate climates and prefers well-drained, fertile soils. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, and it is often cultivated for its edible fruits. The everbearing blackberry is valued for its hardiness and ability to produce multiple harvests per year."
