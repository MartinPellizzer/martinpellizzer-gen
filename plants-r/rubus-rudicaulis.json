    "intro": "Rubus rudicaulis, commonly known as the rough bramble, is a species of flowering plant in the rose family (Rosaceae). It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant produces edible berries that are typically red or black in color, though they are often too sour for direct consumption. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, such as woodlands and stream banks. Rubus rudicaulis is native to parts of Europe and Asia and is often found in temperate climates."
