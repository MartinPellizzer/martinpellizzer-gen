    "intro": "Rubus vulgaris f. elatior, commonly known as the greater bramble, is a variant of the common bramble, characterized by its more vigorous growth and larger, more showy flowers. It is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia, typically found in hedgerows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils. The plant produces aggregate fruits, known as drupes, which are edible and often used in jams and jellies. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it has thorny stems that provide structural support. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological role in supporting wildlife."
