    "intro": "Rubus thyrsoideus proles elatior, commonly known as the tall raspberry, is a species of bramble native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its erect growth habit and clusters of white to pale yellow flowers. The plant produces red, edible berries similar to those of other Rubus species, though they are often smaller and more acidic. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the stems are covered in fine, soft hairs. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and thickets."
