    "intro": "Rubus villicaulis microgene aurensis, commonly known as the golden alpine raspberry, is a shrub native to high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and small, hairy leaves that are adapted to cold, harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by red, edible berries in late summer. Its botanical features include a compact growth habit and specialized root systems that help it survive in nutrient-poor soils. This species is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to alpine conditions."
