    "intro": "Ranunculus schmidtii, commonly known as Schmidt's buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features basal leaves that are palmately lobed and often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy yellow flowers with five petal-like sepals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
