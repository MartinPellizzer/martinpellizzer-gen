    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus subsp. dysanthus, commonly known as the yellow water crowfoot, is a perennial aquatic plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features delicate, floating leaves that are typically divided into three segments, with a waxy surface that helps repel water. The plant produces bright yellow flowers with five to eight petals, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and lakes. Its botanical structure is adapted to aquatic environments, with roots that anchor it in muddy substrates and specialized leaves for photosynthesis in water."
