    "intro": "Rosa uriensis var. rigidula, commonly known as the rigid rose, is a variant of the Uriensis rose native to the mountainous regions of central Europe. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and dense, thorny stems that give it a rigid appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink to white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are dark green, serrated, and arranged alternately along the stems. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
