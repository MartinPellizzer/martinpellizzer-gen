    "intro": "Rosularia platyphylla, commonly known as the flat-leaved stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a compact, rosette-shaped growth form with fleshy, spoon-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It is well adapted to rocky and arid environments, storing water in its thick leaves. Rosularia platyphylla is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its attractive appearance and low maintenance requirements."
