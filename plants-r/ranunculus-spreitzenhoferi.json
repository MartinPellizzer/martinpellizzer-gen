    "intro": "Ranunculus spreitzenhoferi, commonly known as the Spreitzenhofer's buttercup, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Alps. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family, characterized by its showy, often brightly colored flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and thrives in cool, temperate climates. Its leaves are palmately divided, and the flowers usually have five to seven petals. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
