    "intro": "Ranunculus praemorsus subvar. pusillus, commonly known as the dwarf death's-head cup, is a delicate herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features small, yellow flowers with a distinctive black center, resembling a death's head, which is a key characteristic of the species. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a hairy texture that helps protect it from harsh environmental conditions. The flowers bloom in early summer, adding a striking visual element to its natural habitat."
