    "intro": "Rubus macrophyllus subsp. belophorus, commonly known as the large-leaf blackberry, is a shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its large, leathery leaves and thorny stems, which are typical features of the Rubus genus. The plant produces aggregate fruits composed of small, dark red to black drupelets. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and thickets. Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and a valuable species for horticultural study."
