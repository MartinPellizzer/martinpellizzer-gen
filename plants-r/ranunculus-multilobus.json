    "intro": "Ranunculus multilobus, commonly known as the multilobed buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features delicate, bright yellow flowers with numerous petals arranged in a cup-like shape, typical of the Ranunculaceae family. The plant has finely divided, lobed leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, aiding in water retention in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or alpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
