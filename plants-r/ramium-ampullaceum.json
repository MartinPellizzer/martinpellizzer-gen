    "intro": "Ramium ampullaceum, commonly known as the bladder grass, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its erect, slender stems and small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white in color. The plant produces distinctive seed pods that are inflated and resemble bladders, which is a key feature in its common name. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal or semi-arid regions. Ramium ampullaceum is adapted to withstand drought conditions and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
