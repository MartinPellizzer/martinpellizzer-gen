    "intro": "Rhus calophylla, commonly known as the smooth sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and turn vibrant red in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by red, fuzzy berries that are an important food source for birds. Rhus calophylla thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native landscapes."
