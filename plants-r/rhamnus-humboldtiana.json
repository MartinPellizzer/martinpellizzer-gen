    "intro": "Rhamnus humboldtiana, commonly known as the Humboldt\u2019s buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the coastal regions of central and southern California. It typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the coastline, where it thrives in coastal climates with mild winters and warm, dry summers. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by black, berry-like fruits that are an important food source for local wildlife. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and the plant is often used in coastal restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize dunes. Rhamnus humboldtiana is also valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use by indigenous peoples."
