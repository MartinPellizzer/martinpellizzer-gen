It features lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy, bluish-gray coating, giving it its common name. The plant produces striking red-orange flowers with prominent yellow stamens, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and unique foliage, it is cultivated in gardens with specific humidity and light conditions."
