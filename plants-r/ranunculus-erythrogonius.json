    "intro": "Ranunculus erythrogonius, commonly known as the red-lobed buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features showy, palmately divided yellow flowers with red veins, which are typically borne on slender, hairy stems. The plant has palmate leaves that are deeply lobed and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in some areas."
