    "intro": "Rosa arvensis f. pseudostylosa, commonly known as the creeping wild rose, is a botanical variant of the common dog rose. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and thorny stems, often forming dense mats on the ground. The flowers are typically pink to white, with five petals, and bloom in early summer. This subspecies is adapted to moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows and along roadsides. Its leaves are compound, with five to seven leaflets, and it produces hips that are similar to those of other Rosa species."
