It features a basal rosette of deeply lobed, palmately divided leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating. The plant produces showy yellow flowers with five petals and numerous stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade.
