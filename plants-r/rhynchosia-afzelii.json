    "intro": "Rhynchosia afzelii, commonly known as the African velvet bean, is a climbing legume native to tropical Africa. It features compound leaves with three to five pairs of ovate leaflets and produces showy, yellow-orange flowers with a distinctive, spurred petal. The plant bears pods that contain edible seeds, which are rich in protein and used in local cuisines. It thrives in moist, fertile soils and is often found in savannas and along riverbanks. Rhynchosia afzelii is also valued for its role in soil enrichment due to its nitrogen-fixing ability."
