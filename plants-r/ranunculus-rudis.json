    "intro": "Ranunculus rudis, commonly known as the water crowfoot, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in shallow freshwater habitats such as streams, ponds, and wet meadows. The plant features bright yellow or white flowers with five to eight petals, and its leaves are deeply divided into slender, thread-like segments. Ranunculus rudis has a rhizomatous root system that helps it spread and colonize new areas. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and small fish."
