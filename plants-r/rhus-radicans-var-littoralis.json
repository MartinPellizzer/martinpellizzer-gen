    "intro": "Rhus radicans var. littoralis, commonly known as coastal buckthorn, is a shrub native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and its clusters of yellowish-green flowers that appear in the spring. The plant produces small, smooth, dark blue berries that are edible for some wildlife but toxic to humans. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils along shorelines and is adapted to salt spray and periodic inundation. This species plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various birds and insects."
