    "intro": "Rhaphidophora angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf staghorn fern, is a tropical epiphytic plant native to Southeast Asia. It features a distinctive, tree-like structure with a central caudex and long, arching leaves that resemble the antlers of a stag. The plant's leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a waxy texture and a deep green color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This species is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and unique appearance."
