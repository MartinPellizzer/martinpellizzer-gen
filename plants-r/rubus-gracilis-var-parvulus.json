    "intro": "Rubus gracilis var. parvulus, commonly known as the slender blackberry shrub, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of 1\u20132 meters and is characterized by its thin, wiry stems and small, trifoliate leaves. The plant produces aggregate fruits, known as berries, which are typically dark purple to black when mature. These berries are often consumed by birds and small mammals, aiding in seed dispersal. It thrives in moist, woodland habitats and is often found in partial shade."
