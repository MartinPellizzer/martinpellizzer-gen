    "intro": "Rubus pyramidalis var. eupectus, commonly known as the smooth-leaf blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, less hairy leaves compared to other Rubus species, which helps in distinguishing it from its relatives. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically smaller than those of other blackberry varieties. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight. Botanically, it is notable for its thorny stems and its role in local ecosystems as a food source for wildlife."
