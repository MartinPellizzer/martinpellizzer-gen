    "intro": "Rhabdocaulon coccineum, commonly known as the scarlet root or red root, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, aromatic stems and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces a taproot that is often reddish in color, which is the part typically harvested for medicinal or culinary use. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands or along stream banks. The leaves are pinnately divided, giving the plant a delicate, fern-like appearance."
