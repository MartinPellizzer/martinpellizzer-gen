    "intro": "Ranunculus petiolatus, commonly known as the petioled buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the northern regions of North America. It features delicate, palmately lobed leaves with long petioles, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with five petals, often surrounded by a ring of sepals. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain environments."
