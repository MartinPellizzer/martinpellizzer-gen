    "intro": "Rubus montensis, commonly known as the mountain raspberry, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, edible berries. The plant typically grows in rocky or wooded areas, preferring well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it produces white or pale pink flowers in the spring. The berries, which ripen in late summer, are often used in culinary applications or for making jams and wines."
