    "intro": "Rubus prostratus, commonly known as the prostrate raspberry, is a low-growing shrub native to the northern regions of North America. It features trailing stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats of foliage. The plant produces small, edible red berries that are similar in taste to raspberries. Its leaves are compound, typically consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets. Rubus prostratus thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks."
