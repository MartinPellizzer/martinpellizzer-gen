    "intro": "Rosa pendulina var. intermedia, commonly known as the Cascade rose, is a hybrid rose species native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is characterized by its weeping growth habit, with long, arching branches that produce clusters of fragrant, pink flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 feet, and its leaves are compound, consisting of five to seven oval-shaped leaflets. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for gardeners seeking a decorative and hardy shrub. The Cascade rose is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
