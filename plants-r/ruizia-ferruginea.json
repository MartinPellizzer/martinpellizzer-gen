    "intro": "Ruizia ferruginea, commonly known as the rusty ruizia, is a striking evergreen shrub or small tree native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves that are often adorned with rust-colored veins, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom throughout the year, attracting a variety of pollinators. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes in warm climates. Ruizia ferruginea is relatively low-maintenance, thriving in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade."
