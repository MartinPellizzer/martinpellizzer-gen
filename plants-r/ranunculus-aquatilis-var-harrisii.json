It typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes. The plant has a short, rhizomatous stem that supports its foliage and reproductive structures. Its flowers are usually solitary and feature five sepals that resemble petals, a trait common in the Ranunculaceae family. This variant is notable for its adaptability to wetland habitats and its role in supporting aquatic ecosystems."
