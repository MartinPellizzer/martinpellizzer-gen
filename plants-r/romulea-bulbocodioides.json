It features a compact, underground bulb that stores nutrients and water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces striking, showy flowers in shades of yellow and orange, typically blooming in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, forming a rosette around the base of the plant. Romulea bulbocodioides is well adapted to rocky and sandy soils, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes."
