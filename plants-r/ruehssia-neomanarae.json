    "intro": "Ruehssia neomanarae, commonly known as the Manarae ruehssia, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Madagascar. It belongs to the family Anacardiaceae, which includes plants like the cashew and sumac. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered leaves and delicate, fragrant white flowers that bloom during the wet season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
