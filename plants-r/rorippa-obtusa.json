    "intro": "Rorippa obtusa, commonly known as broad-leaved water-crowfoot, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic flowering plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in shallow water, ponds, and damp soil, often forming dense mats on the surface. The plant features basal leaves that are broadly ovate with a wavy margin and small, white flowers arranged in a single umbel. Its leaves are usually floating or floating on the water surface, while its roots anchor in the substrate. Rorippa obtusa is an important part of wetland ecosystems, providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates and serving as a food source for various herbivores."
