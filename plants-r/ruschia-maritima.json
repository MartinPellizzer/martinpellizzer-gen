    "intro": "Ruschia maritima, commonly known as coastal Ruschia, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a low-growing perennial shrub with succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to coastal and sandy habitats. Due to its resilience and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens with Mediterranean or coastal climates."
