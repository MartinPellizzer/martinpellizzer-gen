    "intro": "Rubus substiriacus, commonly known as the European blackberry bramble. It is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family, characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, dark berries. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in woodland edges and hedgerows. Its leaves are typically trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it produces white to pale yellow flowers in the spring. The fruit, while edible, is generally less sweet and more tart compared to other blackberry varieties."
