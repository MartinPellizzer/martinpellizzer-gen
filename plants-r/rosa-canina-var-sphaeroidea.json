    "intro": "Rosa canina var. sphaeroidea, commonly known as the spherical rose or hedge rose, is a variety of the dog rose. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and rounded, thorned stems. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its hips, which are the fruit, are typically orange-red and contain a high concentration of vitamin C. This variety is often used in hedgerows and as a decorative plant due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
