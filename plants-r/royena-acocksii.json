    "intro": "Royena acocksii, commonly known as the Acocks' rock fig, is a small shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers followed by edible, fig-like fruits. It is often found growing on rocky outcrops and in sandy soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
