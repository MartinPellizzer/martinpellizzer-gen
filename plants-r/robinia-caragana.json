    "intro": "Robinia caragana, commonly known as the honey locust, is a deciduous leguminous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically pinnately arranged and divided into small, oval-shaped leaflets. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers that appear in clusters, followed by long, slender pods containing several seeds. It has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion and is often used in reforestation projects. The plant is also valued for its hard, durable wood and its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
