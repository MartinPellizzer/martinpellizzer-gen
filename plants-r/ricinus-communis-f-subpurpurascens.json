    "intro": "Ricinus communis f. subpurpurascens, commonly known as the purple leaf castor bean, is a variant of the castor oil plant characterized by its striking foliage. The leaves are typically broad, palmately lobed, and exhibit a deep purple to reddish hue, especially under full sun. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens and landscapes. It produces the same spiny, capsule-like fruits as the species, containing toxic seeds. The plant thrives in warm climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
