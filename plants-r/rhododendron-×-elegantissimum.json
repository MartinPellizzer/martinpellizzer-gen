    "intro": "Rhododendron \u00d7 elegantissimum, commonly known as the elegant rhododendron, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Rhododendron catawbiense and Rhododendron maximum. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range in color from pink to red, often with a white or pale pink throat. The plant typically grows as an evergreen shrub, reaching heights of up to 6 feet, with dense, leathery foliage. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its botanical features make it both ornamental and ecologically significant in its native habitats."
