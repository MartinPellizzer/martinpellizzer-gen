    "intro": "Ruta chalepensis var. longirrostris, commonly known as the long-beaked rue, is a variant of the common rue plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a shrub characterized by its aromatic, pinnately compound leaves and small yellow flowers that appear in the spring. The plant produces small, dark blue to black berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or dry habitats. Its medicinal properties have been historically used, though caution is advised due to its toxic compounds."
