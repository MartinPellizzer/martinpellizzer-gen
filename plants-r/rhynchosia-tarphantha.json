    "intro": "Rhynchosia tarphantha, commonly known as the African velvet bean, is a climbing legume native to tropical Africa. It features trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces and produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes. The plant is characterized by its pod-like fruits, which contain several seeds encased in a fibrous membrane. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fallow fields. Rhynchosia tarphantha is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability and is used in agricultural systems to improve soil fertility."
