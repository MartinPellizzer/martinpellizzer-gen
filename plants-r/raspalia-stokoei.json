    "intro": "Raspalia stokoei, commonly known as the Stokoei raspberry, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of East Africa. It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white, attracting various pollinators. The plant has a shrub-like structure with woody stems and trifoliate leaves that are covered in fine hairs. Its fruit, similar to a raspberry, is edible and has a tart flavor, though it is not widely cultivated. Due to habitat loss, Raspalia stokoei is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
