    "intro": "Rumex \u00d7 babiogorensis, commonly known as the hybrid sorrel, is a naturally occurring hybrid between Rumex acetosa (common sorrel) and Rumex acetobulus (broadleaf sorrel). It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves with a reddish tint and a sour taste due to high levels of oxalic acid. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. This hybrid is of interest to botanists due to its genetic diversity and adaptability."
