    "intro": "Ricinocarpus psilostachyus, commonly known as the slender-stemmed ricin tree, is a tropical plant belonging to the family Euphorbiaceae. It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and compound leaves with long, narrow leaflets. The plant produces small, clustered greenish flowers followed by woody, spiny fruits containing toxic seeds. It is native to parts of Southeast Asia and is known for its ornamental value. However, due to the presence of ricin, a potent toxin, it requires careful handling."
