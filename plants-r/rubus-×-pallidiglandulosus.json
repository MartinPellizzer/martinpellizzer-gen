It is characterized by its thorny stems and aggregate fruits, which are typically dark purple to black in color. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers and has trifoliate leaves with serrated edges. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges or disturbed soils. Its berries are edible, though they are generally less sweet and more tart compared to other blackberry varieties."
