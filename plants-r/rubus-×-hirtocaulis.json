    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 hirtocaulis, commonly known as the hairy-stemmed blackberry, is a hybrid species within the Rubus genus, characterized by its thorny stems and aggregate fruits. It is native to the western United States, particularly in California, where it thrives in coastal and chaparral habitats. The plant produces dark purple to black berries that are typically small and have a tart flavor. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the plant is often found growing in shrub form. Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits a range of morphological variations, making it a subject of interest in botanical studies."
