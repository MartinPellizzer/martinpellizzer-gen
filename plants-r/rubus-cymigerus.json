    "intro": "Rubus cymigerus, commonly known as the evergreen blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit, thorny stems, and small, dark green leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of small, black berries that are edible and have a tart flavor. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal scrub habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered plant species."
