    "intro": "Rostellularia serpyllifolia, commonly known as common bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of Europe, Asia, and North America. It features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats on the ground. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and slightly hairy, often with a reddish tinge when young. Rostellularia serpyllifolia is adapted to moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks."
