    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 hemidrepanophorus, commonly known as the blackberry raspberry. It is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between blackberries (Rubus fruticosus) and raspberries (Rubus idaeus). This species exhibits characteristics of both parent plants, featuring thorny stems and aggregate fruits that are typically reddish to black in color. The leaves are compound, with three to five leaflets, and the plant is often found in temperate regions. It is valued for its edible fruits, which have a flavor profile combining the tartness of raspberries with the richness of blackberries."
