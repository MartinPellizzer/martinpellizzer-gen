It is characterized by its pale blue to white flowers and hairy stems, which give it its common name. The plant is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in areas like the Tien Shan and Pamir Mountains. It thrives in cool, high-altitude environments with well-drained soils. Its botanical features include compound leaves with serrated edges and thorny stems, typical of many rose species."
