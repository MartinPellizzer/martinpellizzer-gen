    "intro": "Rosa retecta, commonly known as the hidden rose, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in countries like Afghanistan and Pakistan. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, fragrant pink or white flowers. Its leaves are deeply lobed and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help to reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Rosa retecta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance and delicate fragrance."
