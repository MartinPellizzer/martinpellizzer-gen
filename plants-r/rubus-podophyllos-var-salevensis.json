It is characterized by its upright growth habit and thorny stems, typical of the Rubus genus. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red when ripe, though they may vary in color depending on the variety. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. This plant is often found in forested areas and along stream banks, where it plays a role in local ecosystems."
