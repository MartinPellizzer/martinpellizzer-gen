It is characterized by its dark purple to black berries, which are typically smaller than those of the standard Rubus rufus. The plant produces compound leaves with serrated edges and thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil. It is often found in mountainous regions and is valued for its edible fruits. The botanical features of this variant make it distinct within the Rubus genus."
