    "intro": "Rhus \u00d7 gymnoclada, commonly known as the smooth sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is a hybrid between Rhus glabra (staghorn sumac) and Rhus aromatica (fragrant sumac), resulting in a plant with distinctive botanical features. The leaves are compound, typically consisting of 11\u201331 leaflets, and are arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in panicles, followed by red, fuzzy fruits that mature in the fall. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
