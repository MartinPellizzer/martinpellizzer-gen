It features compound leaves with serrated edges and produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or yellow in color. The plant is characterized by its thorny stems and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. It blooms in late spring with white or pale pink flowers, and its fruiting season occurs in early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
