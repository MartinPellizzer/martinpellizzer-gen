    "intro": "Rosmarinus pallescens, commonly known as silver rosemary, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which gives it a distinctive appearance and helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is widely used in horticulture for its ornamental value and in aromatherapy due to its essential oils. Rosmarinus pallescens is also valued in culinary applications, though its flavor is milder compared to other rosemary species."
