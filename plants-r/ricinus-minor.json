    "intro": "Ricinus minor, commonly known as the lesser castor oil plant, is a species of flowering plant in the spurge family, Euphorbiaceae. It is a small, herbaceous annual that typically grows to a height of about 30\u201360 cm. The plant produces distinctive, palmately lobed leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in a cup-like structure called a cyathium. Ricinus minor is native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa, and it thrives in dry, sunny environments. It is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique foliage."
