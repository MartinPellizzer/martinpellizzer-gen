    "intro": "Ribes collinum, commonly known as creeping gooseberry, is a deciduous shrub native to North America. It typically grows in moist, sunny to partially shaded areas, often found in wetlands and along stream banks. The plant features small, ovate leaves with serrated edges and produces clusters of yellowish-green flowers in early spring. Its fruit is a small, round berry that ripens to a red color in late summer. Ribes collinum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
