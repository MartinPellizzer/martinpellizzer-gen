    "intro": "Rubus hirtus var. alpigenus, commonly known as the alpine bramble, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits known as drupes, which are typically red or black in color. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it plays an important role in stabilizing soil in rocky and high-altitude areas."
