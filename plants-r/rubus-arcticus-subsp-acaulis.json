It is characterized by its erect, stemless appearance, with small, clustered leaves and white to pinkish flowers. The plant produces aggregate fruits composed of small, juicy drupes. It thrives in nutrient-poor, rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates. Its botanical features make it well-suited for survival in extreme environments."
