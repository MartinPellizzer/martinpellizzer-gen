    "intro": "Rhamnus oleoides subsp. assoana, commonly known as the Ethiopian buckthorn, is a shrub native to Ethiopia and parts of Eritrea. It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by dark purple berries that are edible for some wildlife. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing on rocky soils. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in degraded landscapes."
