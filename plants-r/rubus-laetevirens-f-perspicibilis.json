    "intro": "Rubus laetevirens f. perspicibilis, commonly known as the showy blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant characterized by its distinctive, bright red bracts that persist through the winter. It is a deciduous shrub that produces edible berries, typically dark purple to black in color, which ripen in late summer. The plant is native to eastern North America and thrives in woodland and open areas with well-drained soil. Its foliage is usually dark green with a slightly serrated edge, and it has a vigorous growth habit. This form is prized for its ornamental value, particularly for the striking red bracts that add visual interest to the landscape during the colder months."
