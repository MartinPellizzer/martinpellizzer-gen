    "intro": "Rhamnus saxatilis f. inermis, commonly known as the smooth-fruited buckthorn, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its small, oval leaves that are typically smooth and glabrous on both surfaces. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by dark blue, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds. It thrives in rocky or dry soils and is often found in coastal or mountainous areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil."
