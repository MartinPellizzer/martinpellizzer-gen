    "intro": "Redfieldia hitchcockii f. mutica, commonly known as the smoothleaf redfieldia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its small, white flowers appear in umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family, and bloom in late spring to early summer. The smoothleaf variant is distinguished by its more rounded and less hairy leaves compared to the typical form."
