    "intro": "Ranunculus repens var. hispidus, commonly known as the hairy buttercup, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features bright yellow flowers with five to nine petals, typically blooming in early spring. The leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the stems are covered in fine, stiff hairs, giving it its \"hairy\" characteristic. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland edges and stream banks. This variant is often distinguished from other ranunculus species by its dense pubescence and specific habitat preferences."
