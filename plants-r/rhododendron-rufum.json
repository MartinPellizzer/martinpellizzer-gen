    "intro": "Rhododendron rufum, commonly known as the redleaf azalea, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its dense, upright growth habit and its clusters of showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring. The leaves are typically oval-shaped, glossy, and turn a striking red or orange in the fall, adding to its ornamental value. It prefers acidic, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. This species is also valued for its ability to thrive in cooler climates and its role in supporting local pollinators."
