    "intro": "Romulea bulbocodioides var. elongata, commonly known as the long-stemmed romulea, is a striking bulbous plant native to southern Africa. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of vivid yellow flowers with a distinctive, spurred petal. The plant's bulbous structure allows it to store water and nutrients, aiding survival in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a valuable addition to Mediterranean-style gardens."
