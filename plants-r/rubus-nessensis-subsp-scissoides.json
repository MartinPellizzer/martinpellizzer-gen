    "intro": "Rubus nessensis subsp. scissoides, commonly known as the Scottish blackberry, is a shrub native to the British Isles. It produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically consumed fresh or used in jams. The plant has compound leaves with three to five leaflets, and its stems are armed with stiff, hooked prickles. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodland edges and hedgerows. The subspecies is distinguished by its shorter, more upright growth habit compared to other Rubus species."
