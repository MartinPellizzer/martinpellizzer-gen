    "intro": "Robbrechtia milleri, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and fascinating plant native to the tropical rainforests of Brazil. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant is characterized by its delicate, waxy leaves and its unique, showy white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of moisture and specific soil conditions. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, Robbrechtia milleri is considered endangered and is often protected in conservation programs."
