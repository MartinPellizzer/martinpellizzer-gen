It features showy, cup-shaped flowers with five to eight petals, typically in yellow or white, and is characterized by its deeply lobed leaves. The plant grows from a rhizomatous root system and is often found in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It is a member of the Ranunculaceae family, known for its poisonous sap and delicate, short-lived blooms. The plant's botanical features make it both ornamental and ecologically significant in its native habitats."
