    "intro": "Rhodocodon intermedius, commonly known as the intermediate rhodocodon, is a lesser-known species within the Rhodocodoneae tribe. It is a shrub-like plant characterized by its small, clustered flowers and woody stems. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, where it has adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are often narrow and covered in a fine layer of wax to reduce water loss. The flowers, which are usually pink or red, bloom in spring and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
