    "intro": "Raphanus raphanistrum var. ochroleucus, commonly known as the yellow rocket, is a biennial or annual plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers and pinnately lobed leaves, which are often hairy. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It produces small, elongated pods containing several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural settings."
