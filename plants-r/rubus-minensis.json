    "intro": "Rubus minensis, commonly known as the Chinese blackberry, is a shrub native to eastern Asia, particularly China. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, dark red berries. The plant typically grows in forested areas and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Its leaves are alternate, with serrated edges, and its flowers are white with five petals. The berries are edible but often have a tart flavor, making them a popular ingredient in traditional Chinese cuisine."
