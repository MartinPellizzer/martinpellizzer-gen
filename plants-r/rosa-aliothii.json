    "intro": "Rosa aliothii, commonly known as the Aliothii rose, is a rare and elusive species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has dark green, glossy leaves and produces rose-shaped buds that open into pinkish-white petals. Rosa aliothii is adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
