    "intro": "Ripidium arundinaceum, commonly known as the reed grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy along the edges. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in moist environments such as wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Ripidium arundinaceum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates and birds."
