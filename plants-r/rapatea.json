    "intro": "Rapatea, commonly known as the \"lady's tears\" or \"raven's wing,\" is a genus of flowering plants native to the tropical regions of the Americas. These plants are characterized by their striking, often bioluminescent flowers that emit a soft glow at night. Rapatea species typically grow as herbs or small shrubs, with lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, tubular flowers. The genus is part of the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is known for its unique ecological adaptations. Due to habitat loss, many Rapatea species are threatened with extinction, making conservation efforts crucial for their survival."
