    "intro": "Rubus purpuratus var. pallescens, commonly known as the pale-flowered evergreen blackberry, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and dark green, leathery leaves that remain evergreen throughout the year. The flowers are pale pink to white, with five petals, and appear in clusters during the spring. Its fruit, a small, dark purple berry, is edible but often has a tart flavor. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to the mild, coastal climate of its native range."
