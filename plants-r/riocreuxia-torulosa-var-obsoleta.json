    "intro": "Riocreuxia torulosa var. obsoleta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rock cress, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of white or pale pink. The plant features alternate, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
