    "intro": "Rhamnus crocea var. pilosa, commonly known as the hairy buckthorn, is a shrub native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often thorny stems and small, elliptical leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by dark blue-black berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or hedgerows. Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
