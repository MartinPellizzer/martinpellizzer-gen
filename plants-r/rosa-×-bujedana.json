    "intro": "Rosa \u00d7 bujedana, commonly known as the Bujedana rose, is a hybrid rose species originating from a cross between Rosa rugosa and Rosa \u00d7 centifolia. It is characterized by its robust growth, thorny stems, and dark green, serrated leaves. The plant produces large, fragrant flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It is well-suited for coastal areas due to its tolerance of salt spray and poor soil conditions. The Bujedana rose is also valued for its disease resistance and ability to thrive in a variety of climates."
