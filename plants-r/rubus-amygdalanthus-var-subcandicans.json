    "intro": "Rubus amygdalanthus var. subcandicans, commonly known as the white-fruited raspberry, is a variant of the raspberry plant native to parts of East Asia. It is characterized by its biennial growth habit, with the first year producing vegetative growth and the second year bearing fruit. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically white or pale yellow in color, distinguishing it from the more common red-fruited raspberries. Its flowers are usually pink or white, with five petals and numerous stamens. The plant thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forested areas with moist, well-drained soil."
