It produces vibrant yellow to orange flowers in late spring, followed by small, citrus-scented fruits that are edible but not commonly consumed. The plant is native to arid regions of South America and thrives in full sun with well-draining soil. It is prized for its ornamental value and ability to bloom profusely under proper care. Its unique foliage and fruit make it a distinctive addition to rock gardens and xeriscaped landscapes."
