It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and streamside areas. The plant features thin, wiry stems with thorns and small, trifoliate leaves. Its flowers are white or pale pink, and the fruit is a small, tart blackberry. It plays an important ecological role by providing food for wildlife and stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
