    "intro": "Rosa tenuiflora, commonly known as the Siberian rose, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its simple, thornless stems and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces elliptical, dark green leaves with a slightly hairy texture. Its flowers are typically pink or white, with five petals and numerous stamens, contributing to its ornamental value. Rosa tenuiflora is also valued for its use in hybridizing with other rose species to create new cultivars."
