    "intro": "Rechsteineria macrorhiza, commonly known as the large-rooted rechsteineria, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. It is a perennial herb with a robust root system that contributes to its ability to thrive in moist, temperate environments. The plant typically features finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in summer. It is often found in woodland areas and along stream banks, where it plays a role in soil stabilization. Due to its ecological significance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
