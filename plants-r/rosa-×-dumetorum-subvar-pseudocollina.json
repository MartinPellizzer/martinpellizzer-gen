    "intro": "Rosa \u00d7 dumetorum subvar. pseudocollina, commonly known as the creeping tea rose, is a hybrid shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with sprawling stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink to white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its foliage consists of dark green, trifoliate leaves that are covered in fine, silvery hairs. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover in dry, well-drained soils."
