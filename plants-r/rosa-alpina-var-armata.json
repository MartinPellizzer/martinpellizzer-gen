    "intro": "Rosa alpina var. armata, commonly known as the Alpine rose or alpine dog rose, is a flowering shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with thorny stems and dark green, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is well adapted to cold climates and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens in cooler regions."
