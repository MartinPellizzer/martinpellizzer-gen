    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 cuneatifactus, commonly known as the blackberry-boys, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Rubus ursinus (the American blackberry) and Rubus pectoralis (the evergreen blackberry). It is characterized by its thorny stems, compound leaves with serrated edges, and clusters of small, dark red to black berries. The plant thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland areas or along the edges of forests. Its berries are edible, though they are generally smaller and less sweet compared to other blackberry varieties. The plant's botanical features make it a notable example of natural hybridization in the Rubus genus."
