    "intro": "Rubus hirsutus f. xanthocarpus, commonly known as the yellow-fruited bramble, is a variant of the brambles native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy stems and distinctive yellowish fruits, which differ from the typical red or black berries of other Rubus species. The plant typically grows in shrubland and forest edges, preferring well-drained soils. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, and the leaves are trifoliate with serrated edges. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and unique fruit coloration."
