    "intro": "Rhus leucantha, commonly known as the white-leafed sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically bright green with a waxy coating and turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in panicles, followed by red, fuzzy fruits that are a food source for birds and small mammals. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in woodland edges and disturbed areas. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
