    "intro": "Rubus granulatus var. mentitus, commonly known as the ghost raspberry, is a rare and intriguing species within the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers and red, bi-colored fruits that develop from its compound inflorescences. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in partial shade. Its leaves are trifoliate, with finely serrated margins, and the stems are covered in a distinctive, granular texture. This variety is notable for its unique appearance and limited geographic distribution, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists alike."
