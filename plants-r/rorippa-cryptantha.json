    "intro": "Rorippa cryptantha, commonly known as the narrowleaf watercress, is a small flowering plant native to moist environments in North America. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other mustard family plants. The plant typically grows in wet soils along streams, ponds, and marshes, where it thrives in shallow water or damp ground. Its leaves are alternate, linear, and often have a distinct waxy coating, while its small white flowers are arranged in clusters. Rorippa cryptantha is often found in disturbed or nutrient-rich habitats, and it plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils."
