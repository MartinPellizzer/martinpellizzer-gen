    "intro": "Rubus thyrsiflorus var. genevieri, commonly known as the Genevieve blackberry, is a shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, dark red berries that ripen in late summer. The plant has trifoliate leaves with serrated edges and produces white to pale pink flowers in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or coastal areas. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and edible fruits, though its berries are generally more tart than those of other blackberry species."
