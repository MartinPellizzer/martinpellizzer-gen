    "intro": "Rubus pervagus subsp. repentinus, commonly known as the quick-growing blackberry bramble, is a shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, white flowers that give way to edible blackberries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and thickets. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it both a valuable food source and a potential invasive species in certain areas."
