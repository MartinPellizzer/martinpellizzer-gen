    "intro": "Ribes komarovii f. breviracemum, commonly known as the short-stalked gooseberry, is a compact shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features small, ovate leaves with serrated edges and produces clusters of yellowish-green flowers in early summer. The plant bears edible, tart berries that ripen in late summer, similar to other gooseberry species. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
