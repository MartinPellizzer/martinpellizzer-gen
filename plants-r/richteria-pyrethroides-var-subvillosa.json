    "intro": "Richteria pyrethroides var. subvillosa, commonly known as the velvetleaf richteria, is a perennial shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, glandular-hairy foliage that gives it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are typically oval to lance-shaped with a pointed tip and are often covered in fine, soft hairs. This variety is often found in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or wetland habitats."
