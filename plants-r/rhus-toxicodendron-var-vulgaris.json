    "intro": "Rhus toxicodendron var. vulgaris, commonly known as poison ivy, is a deciduous shrub native to North America. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, each consisting of three leaflets, and it produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by red, fuzzy berries. The plant contains urushiol, a potent allergen that causes skin irritation and itching in many people. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including woodlands, fields, and disturbed soils. Due to its toxic properties, it is often considered a weed and is avoided in many areas."
