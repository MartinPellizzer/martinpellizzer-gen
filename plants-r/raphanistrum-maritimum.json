    "intro": "Raphanistrum maritimum, commonly known as sea rocket, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is an annual or biennial herb that grows in salt marshes and sandy shores, thriving in saline and well-drained soils. The plant has alternate, pinnately compound leaves with serrated edges, and it produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas along coastlines. Raphanistrum maritimum plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various small organisms."
