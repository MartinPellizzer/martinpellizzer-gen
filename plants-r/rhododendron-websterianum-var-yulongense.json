    "intro": "Rhododendron websterianum var. yulongense, commonly known as the Yulong rhododendron, is a rare and striking evergreen shrub native to the Yulong Mountains in Yunnan, China. It features dense, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and elliptical in shape. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in cool, humid climates with well-drained acidic soil. Due to its limited natural range and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable but endangered species in botanical conservation."
