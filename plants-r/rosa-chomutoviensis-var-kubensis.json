    "intro": "Rosa chomutoviensis var. kubensis, commonly known as the Kuban rose, is a rare and ornamental shrub native to southern Russia and the Caucasus region. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and profuse flowering, producing clusters of fragrant, pink to red flowers. The plant features serrated, dark green leaves and thorny stems, typical of many rose species. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for garden cultivation in temperate climates. Due to its limited natural range and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a botanical curiosity and a subject of interest in horticultural research."
