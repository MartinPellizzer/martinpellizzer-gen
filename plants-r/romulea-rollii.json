    "intro": "Romulea rollii, commonly known as the \"dwarf crown orchid,\" is a striking bulbous plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer, often in clusters atop slender stems. Its unique morphology and striking appearance make it a popular choice among succulent and bulb enthusiasts. Due to its limited natural range and habitat specificity, it is also considered a rare and endangered species."
