    "intro": "Rosa abietina f. favratii, commonly known as the Alpine rose or mountain rose, is a rare and cold-hardy shrub native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, dense foliage, and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically has dark green, leathery leaves and produces pink to red flowers with a strong, sweet scent. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity, it is considered a valuable species for botanical research and conservation efforts."
