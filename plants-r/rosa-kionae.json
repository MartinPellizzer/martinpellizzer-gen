    "intro": "Rosa kionae, commonly known as the Kionai rose, is a rare and endangered species native to the high-altitude regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has slender, thornless stems and dark green, velvety leaves that are opposite in arrangement. It thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
