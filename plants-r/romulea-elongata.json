It belongs to the Iridaceae family, which includes irises and gladiolus. The plant produces striking, showy flowers with petals that are often tinged with red or purple, resembling those of the iris. Its bulbs are adapted to store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. Romulea elongata typically blooms in spring and is prized for its ornamental value in gardens."
