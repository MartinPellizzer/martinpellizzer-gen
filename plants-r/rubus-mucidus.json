    "intro": "Rubus mucidus, commonly known as the stinking blackberry, is a species of bramble native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves, typical of the Rubus genus. The plant produces small, dark berries that are often described as having a strong, unpleasant odor. These berries are typically harvested when fully ripe, though their flavor is generally considered bitter and astringent. Due to its sharp scent and taste, it is less commonly cultivated compared to other blackberry varieties."
