    "intro": "Rhododendron roseum f. plenum, commonly known as the full-flowered rhododendron, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of China. It features dense, leathery foliage that provides a lush green backdrop to its showy flowers. The plant produces clusters of large, bell-shaped blooms in shades of pink and white, which appear in late spring to early summer. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its compact growth habit and ornamental value make it a desirable addition to both landscape and container settings."
