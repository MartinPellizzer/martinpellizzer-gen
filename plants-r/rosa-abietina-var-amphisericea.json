    "intro": "Rosa abietina var. amphisericea, commonly known as the Alpine rose, is a rare and hardy shrub native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense clusters of small, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features dark green, leathery leaves that are often covered in fine, silvery hairs, providing a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive species in conservation efforts."
