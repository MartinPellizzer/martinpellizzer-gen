It is characterized by its prickly stems and large, broad leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by dark purple berries in late summer. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in rocky or disturbed soils. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
