    "intro": "Rosa alpina f. typica, commonly known as the Alpine rose, is a frost-resistant shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features simple, alternate leaves that are typically ovate to elliptical in shape, with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces fragrant, pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its woody stems are covered in thorns, and it is often found growing in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in cold climates."
