    "intro": "Rupestrea carvalhoana, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a flowering plant native to the rocky areas of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its epiphytic growth habit, often growing on tree trunks or rocks. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow, which bloom during the warmer months. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air and substrate, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, Rupestrea carvalhoana is a subject of interest for botanists and horticulturists alike."
