    "intro": "Ranunculus sphinx, commonly known as the sphinx buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It features showy, yellow flowers with a distinctive, almost face-like appearance, which gives it its common name. The plant has a basal rosette of finely divided, lobed leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its flowers typically bloom in spring and are followed by small, green fruits that develop into hairy, dry capsules. Ranunculus sphinx prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges."
