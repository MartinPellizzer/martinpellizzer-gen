    "intro": "Ranunculus laetus subsp. chitralicus, commonly known as the Chitral buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It features delicate, bright yellow flowers with a distinctive cup-like shape, typically blooming in early spring. The plant has finely divided, palmately arranged leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. It thrives in moist, cool environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
