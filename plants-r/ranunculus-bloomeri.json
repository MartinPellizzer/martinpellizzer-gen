    "intro": "Ranunculus bloomeri, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada buttercup, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It features showy, bright yellow flowers with five to seven petals, typically appearing in early spring. The plant has a basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
