    "intro": "Ranunculus gmelinii subsp. purshii, commonly known as the Pursh's buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the northern regions of North America. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as wet meadows and stream banks. The plant features delicate, palmately divided leaves and bright yellow flowers with five petals. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and is often found in association with other wetland flora. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
