    "intro": "Rhynchotechum ellipticum, commonly known as the elliptical thyme. This perennial herb is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in rocky and sandy soils. It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically gray-green in color, covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow flowers during the summer months. Rhynchotechum ellipticum is often used in rock gardens due to its compact growth habit and drought tolerance."
