    "intro": "Ranunculus acris var. propinquus, commonly known as the meadow buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features a basal rosette of trifoliate, serrated leaves and produces showy yellow flowers with five to eight sepals that resemble petals. The plant typically grows in moist meadows, woodlands, and along streambanks, preferring well-drained soils. It blooms from late spring to early summer, and its flowers are pollinated primarily by insects such as bees and flies. The species is characterized by its hairy stems and is often found in association with other early successional plants in its habitat."
