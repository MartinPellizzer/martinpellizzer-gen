It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in moist, wooded areas and thrives in partial shade. The plant produces small, dark red berries that are edible but often have a tart flavor. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and its stems are covered in thorny prickles. The plant plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing food for wildlife and supporting pollinators."
