    "intro": "Rosa capreolata, commonly known as the mountain rose or alpine rose, is a deciduous shrub native to the high elevations of the Rocky Mountains. It features slender, arching stems that are often covered in a dense layer of white to pink flowers. The plant produces small, oval-shaped leaves with serrated edges, typical of many rose species. Its flowers are fragrant and bloom in late spring to early summer. Rosa capreolata is well adapted to cold climates and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and hardiness."
