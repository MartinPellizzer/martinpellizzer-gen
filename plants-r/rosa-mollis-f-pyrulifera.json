    "intro": "Rosa mollis f. pyrulifera, commonly known as the Pyrulifera form of the soft rose, is a unique horticultural variant of the Rosa mollis species. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and smaller, more delicate flowers compared to the typical Rosa mollis. The foliage is usually covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. This form is prized for its ornamental value in gardens and for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. It is often used in rock gardens or as a border plant due to its low maintenance requirements and aesthetic appeal."
