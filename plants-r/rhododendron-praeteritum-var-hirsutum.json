    "intro": "Rhododendron praeteritum var. hirsutum, commonly known as the hairy rhododendron, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of southeastern China. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage that is often covered in fine, hairy pubescence, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to deep red, typically blooming in late spring. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its botanical features make it both ornamental and ecologically significant in its native habitat."
