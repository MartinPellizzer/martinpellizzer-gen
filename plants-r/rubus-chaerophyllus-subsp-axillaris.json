    "intro": "Rubus chaerophyllus subsp. axillaris, commonly known as the alpine bramble, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender stems and small, trifoliate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces white to pale pink flowers in late summer, followed by edible, red berries that are favored by wildlife. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils at high elevations. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
