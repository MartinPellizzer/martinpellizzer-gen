    "intro": "Rosa canina var. subcristata, commonly known as the crinkled hips rose, is a variant of the dog rose characterized by its distinctive, crinkled fruit. It is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia, typically growing in woodland and hedgerow habitats. The plant produces fragrant pink flowers in early summer, followed by orange-red, hairy hips that persist through winter. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with serrated edges, and it has thorny stems typical of the Rosa genus. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal medicine."
