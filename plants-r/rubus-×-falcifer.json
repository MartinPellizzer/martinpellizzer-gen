    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 falcifer, commonly known as the blackberry bramble, is a hybrid shrub belonging to the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves, which are typically serrated and arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces aggregate fruits, known as drupes, which are dark purple to black in color and have a sweet-tart flavor. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils. Due to its vigorous growth, it can become invasive in certain regions if not managed properly."
