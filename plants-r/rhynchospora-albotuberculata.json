It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and grass-like plants. The plant features slender, triangular stems and small, pale green to white flowers arranged in spikelets. Its leaves are narrow and often have a distinctive waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in moist environments. Rhynchospora albotuberculata plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
