    "intro": "Rhus elegans var. glauca, commonly known as the blueleaf sumac, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, upright growth habit and its distinctive blue-green leaves that turn red in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clustered inflorescences, followed by red, fuzzy fruits that are edible for wildlife. Its leaves and stems are often used in traditional medicine for their astringent properties. The species is adapted to a variety of soil types and thrives in full sun to partial shade."
