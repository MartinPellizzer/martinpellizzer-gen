    "intro": "Rauvolfia molokaiensis, commonly known as the Moloka\u02bbi rooibos, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its woody stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces red, fleshy fruits that contain seeds, which are dispersed by animals. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
