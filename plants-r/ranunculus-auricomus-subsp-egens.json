    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus subsp. egens, commonly known as the golden buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a basal rosette of finely divided, bright yellow flowers with a distinctive crown-like structure. The plant has smooth, hairless stems that rise from the rosette and bear the showy blooms. Its leaves are palmately lobed, with a finely toothed margin, and are typically covered in a waxy layer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks."
