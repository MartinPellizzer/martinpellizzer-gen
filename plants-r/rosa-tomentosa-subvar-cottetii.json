    "intro": "Rosa tomentosa subvar. cottetii, commonly known as the Cottet's woolly rose, is a shrub-like plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, grayish-green leaves and thorny stems, typical of many rose species. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often cultivated in gardens across temperate climates."
