    "intro": "Ribes saxosum, commonly known as the rock gooseberry, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, followed by bright red berries that are edible for humans and wildlife. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have serrated edges, contributing to its ornamental value. Ribes saxosum is also valued for its role in ecological systems, providing food for birds and insects."
