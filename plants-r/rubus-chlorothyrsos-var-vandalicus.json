    "intro": "Rubus chlorothyrsos var. vandalicus, commonly known as the Vandalic blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to certain regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dark purple to black berries, which are typically smaller than those of other Rubus species. The plant has compound leaves with serrated edges and produces white or pale pink flowers in the spring. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils. Its berries are edible but are less commonly cultivated compared to other blackberry varieties."
