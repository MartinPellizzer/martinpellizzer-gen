It is characterized by its thorny stems and dark purple to black berries that ripen in late summer. The plant produces small, glandular hairs on its leaves and stems, which give it its specific variety name. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland areas or along forest edges. The berries are edible and have a tart flavor, making them popular in local cuisines and for jams and preserves."
