    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 albidus var. gracilis, commonly known as the slender blackberry, is a hybrid plant within the Rubus genus. It is characterized by its slender, trailing growth habit and small, pale pink to white flowers. The plant produces small, edible berries that are typically less tart than those of other blackberry varieties. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or partially shaded environments. Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits a range of morphological variations, making it a subject of interest in botanical studies."
