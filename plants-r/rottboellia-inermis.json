    "intro": "Rottboellia inermis, commonly known as the slender rottbollia, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. It typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides, fields, and waste areas, and is often considered a weed. The plant has slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually less than 10 cm in length. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are arranged in spikelets, and it produces seeds that are dispersed by wind. Rottboellia inermis is adapted to thrive in warm climates and can be found in a variety of habitats, including wetlands and dry grasslands."
