    "intro": "Ribes leptanthum var. lasianthum, commonly known as the large-flowered gooseberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, yellowish-green leaves that turn red in the fall. The plant produces showy, pink to white flowers in early summer, which are followed by orange to red berries that are edible but often tart. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable ornamental plant in gardens. Its botanical features make it a valuable species for both ecological and horticultural purposes."
