    "intro": "Ranunculus cymbalaria var. typicus, commonly known as the water crowfoot, is a flowering plant belonging to the Ranunculaceae family. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers with five to eight petals and its finely divided, feather-like leaves that grow underwater or in shallow water. The plant typically thrives in moist or aquatic environments, such as ponds, streams, and wet meadows. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and colonize new areas effectively. The species is also notable for its ability to tolerate a wide range of water conditions, making it a common sight in freshwater habitats."
