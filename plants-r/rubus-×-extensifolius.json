It is characterized by its large, leathery leaves that can reach up to 15 cm in length. The plant produces dark purple to black berries that are typically larger than those of its parent species. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Due to its vigorous growth, it can become invasive in certain regions if not managed properly."
