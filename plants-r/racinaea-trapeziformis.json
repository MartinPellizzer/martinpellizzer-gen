    "intro": "Racinaea trapeziformis, commonly known as the trapeziform staghorn fern, is a unique epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the Polypodiaceae family and is characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds that resemble the antlers of a stag. The plant's rhizome is thick and fleshy, anchoring it to trees and providing nutrients through its roots. Its leaves are typically broad and leathery, with a waxy surface that helps retain moisture in its humid habitat. Racinaea trapeziformis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is well-suited to shaded, moist environments."
