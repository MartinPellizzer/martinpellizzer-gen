    "intro": "Rubus andrewsianus, commonly known as the Andes raspberry, is a species of bramble native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and produces small, edible red berries that are often used in local cuisine. The plant has compound leaves with serrated edges and produces white flowers that bloom in the spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of the Andean mountains. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
