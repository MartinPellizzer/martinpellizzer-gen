It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and clusters of fragrant, pink to white flowers. The plant produces oval, greenish-yellow fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
