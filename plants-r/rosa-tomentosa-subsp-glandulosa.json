    "intro": "Rosa tomentosa subsp. glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular woolly rose, is a shrub-like plant native to parts of Asia, including China and Japan. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage covered in glandular hairs, which give it a distinctive silvery-gray appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink to red, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its stems are often armed with thorns, and the leaves are compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique texture and floral display."
