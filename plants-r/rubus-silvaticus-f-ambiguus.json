    "intro": "Rubus silvaticus f. ambiguus, commonly known as the alpine bramble, is a subspecies of the common bramble found in alpine and subalpine regions. It is characterized by its slender, thorny stems and small, trifoliate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces pale pink to white flowers in clusters, which are followed by red, hairy berries. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in mountainous regions."
