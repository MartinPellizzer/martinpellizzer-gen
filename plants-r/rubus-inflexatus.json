It is characterized by its woody stems that are flattened and often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces aggregate fruits, which are typically dark purple to black in color when ripe. Its leaves are palmately lobed and have a serrated margin. Rubus inflexatus is often found in moist woodlands and along stream banks, where it thrives in partial shade."
