    "intro": "Railliardia ciliolata, commonly known as the hairy leaf orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to specific regions of Australia. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom during the cooler months, typically in spring or early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or clay soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in some areas."
