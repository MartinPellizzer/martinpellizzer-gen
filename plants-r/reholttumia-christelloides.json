    "intro": "Reholttumia christelloides, commonly known as the Christmas cactus, is a tropical epiphytic plant native to Brazil. It is characterized by its thick, segmented stems that bear clusters of vibrant, showy flowers in shades of red, pink, and white. The plant typically blooms during the holiday season, hence its common name. Its leaves are usually oval-shaped and arranged in a zigzag pattern along the stems. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
