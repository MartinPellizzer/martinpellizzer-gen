    "intro": "Rubus hirtus var. adenodon, commonly known as the prickly raspberry, is a shrub native to eastern North America. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, oval leaves. The plant produces edible red berries that ripen in the summer, though they are often overshadowed by its more showy relatives. It thrives in moist, wooded areas and is often found in the understory of deciduous forests. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental or for its fruit."
