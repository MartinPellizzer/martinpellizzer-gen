    "intro": "Rubus rivularis f. grossidens, commonly known as the broad-leafed blackberry, is a botanical variant of the blackberry plant characterized by its broader, more robust leaves compared to the typical species. It is a perennial shrub native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black in color, with a tart flavor. Its flowers are white or pale pink, with five petals and numerous stamens, typical of the Rubus genus. This form is valued both for its ornamental appeal and for its edible fruits, though it is less commonly cultivated than other blackberry varieties."
