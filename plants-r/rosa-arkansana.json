    "intro": "Rosa arkansana, commonly known as the Arkansas rose, is a deciduous shrub native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its thorned stems, trifoliate leaves, and clusters of fragrant pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces rose hips, which are the fruit containing seeds, and these hips are often used in herbal remedies. Rosa arkansana prefers full sun and well-drained soil, making it adaptable to a variety of habitats including prairies and woodland edges. Its ornamental value and ecological importance make it a notable species in native plant gardens."
