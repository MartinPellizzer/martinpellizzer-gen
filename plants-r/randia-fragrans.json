    "intro": "Randia fragrans, commonly known as the sweet stinkwood, is a tropical shrub native to regions of Africa, the Caribbean, and parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, often emitting a sweet, honey-like scent. The plant has dark green, oval-shaped leaves and produces small, round berries that turn red when mature. Randia fragrans is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties. Its growth habit makes it suitable for hedges or as a specimen plant in warm climates."
