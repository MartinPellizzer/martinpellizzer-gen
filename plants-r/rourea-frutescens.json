    "intro": "Rourea frutescens, commonly known as the velvetwood or red velvetwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage that ranges from dark green to reddish-purple, depending on the season and light exposure. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or greenish flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its unique bark, which is thick and often flaky, contributes to its ornamental value. Rourea frutescens is valued in horticulture for its attractive appearance and ability to thrive in shaded, humid environments."
