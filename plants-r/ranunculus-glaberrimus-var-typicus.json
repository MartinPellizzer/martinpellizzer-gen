    "intro": "Ranunculus glaberrimus var. typicus, commonly known as the rough meadow buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the temperate regions of Europe and western Asia. It features a basal rosette of dark green, hairy leaves that are typically lobed and have a rough texture. The plant produces showy yellow flowers with five petals, often accompanied by numerous stamens and a central pistil. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, streambanks, and woodland edges. Due to its ornamental value, it is also cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in some areas."
