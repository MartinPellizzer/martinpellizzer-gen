    "intro": "Rhamnus latifolia, commonly known as broadleaf buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, woodland habitats and can reach heights of up to 10 feet. The plant features simple, alternate leaves that are broadly ovate with smooth or slightly toothed edges. Its small, greenish-yellow flowers appear in clusters and are followed by dark blue berries that are edible for some bird species. The plant has a deep root system and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil."
