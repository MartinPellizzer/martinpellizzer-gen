    "intro": "Racaria sylvatica, commonly known as the forest racaria, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions. It typically grows to a height of about 30\u201360 cm, featuring upright stems and lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of white and pale pink, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, making it resilient in woodland environments. Racaria sylvatica is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded garden settings."
