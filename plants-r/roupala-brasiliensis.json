    "intro": "Roupala brasiliensis, commonly known as the Brazilian roupala, is a small evergreen tree native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It belongs to the family Proteaceae and is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and smooth, gray bark. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, spherical fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in secondary forests. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
