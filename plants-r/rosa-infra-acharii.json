    "intro": "Rosa infra-acharii, commonly known as the low thorned rose, is a species of flowering plant native to parts of Asia. It is a shrub that typically grows in mountainous regions and is characterized by its thorny stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces pink to red flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by small, oval-shaped fruits. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a serrated edge, typical of many rose species. Rosa infra-acharii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic qualities."
