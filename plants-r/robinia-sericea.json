    "intro": "Robinia sericea, commonly known as silky acacia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to South Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and pinnately compound leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces yellow, fragrant flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in racemes. Its bark is smooth and grayish, becoming fissured with age, and it has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion. Robinia sericea is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a valuable plant for landscaping and ecological restoration."
