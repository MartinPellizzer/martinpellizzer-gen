    "intro": "Rhododendron salignum, commonly known as the alpine rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows at high altitudes, often in rocky or alpine environments. The plant produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are leathery and evergreen, providing year-round foliage in its harsh habitat. Rhododendron salignum is well adapted to cold climates and is often found in alpine meadows and subalpine forests."
