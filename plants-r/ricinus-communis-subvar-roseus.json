    "intro": "Ricinus communis subvar. roseus, commonly known as the roseleaf castor oil plant, is a variant of the castor oil plant native to tropical regions. It is characterized by its large, velvety, rose-pink to reddish-purple leaves that are distinctive and ornamental. The plant produces spiny capsules containing toxic seeds, similar to other Ricinus species. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Due to its striking foliage, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in gardens and greenhouses."
