    "intro": "Rosa glauca f. hispida, commonly known as the hispid bluebush rose, is a compact, shrubby plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and small, pale blue to lavender flowers that bloom in late spring. The leaves are typically gray-green with a waxy coating, and the foliage is covered in fine, bristly hairs, giving it a distinctive, rugged appearance. This cultivar is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid climates."
