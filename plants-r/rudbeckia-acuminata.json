    "intro": "Rudbeckia acuminata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved coneflower, is a perennial herb native to the eastern and central United States. It features upright, branching stems that bear bright yellow ray florets surrounding a central disk of dark brown to black tubular flowers. The plant produces showy, daisy-like blooms from late summer to early autumn, making it a popular choice for gardens and natural landscapes. Its leaves are lance-shaped, with serrated edges, and are covered in fine, hairy textures. Rudbeckia acuminata is adapted to a variety of soil types and thrives in full sun, often found in prairies and open woodlands."
