    "intro": "Rudbeckia pinnata, commonly known as the tall coneflower, is a North American native plant characterized by its striking yellow-orange ray flowers and a central brown disk. It typically grows up to 6 feet tall, featuring lance-shaped, gray-green leaves that are alternate along the stem. The plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, often found in prairies and open woodlands. Its showy blooms attract pollinators like bees and butterflies, making it a valuable addition to native gardens. Rudbeckia pinnata is also known for its ability to reseed itself, contributing to its natural spread in suitable habitats."
