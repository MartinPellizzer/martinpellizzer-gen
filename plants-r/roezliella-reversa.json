    "intro": "Roezliella reversa, commonly known as the reverse roezliella, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive floral structure, with petals that open in a reverse orientation compared to most flowering plants. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in cloud forests. Its leaves are typically broad and glossy, adapted to maximize light absorption in low-light conditions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Roezliella reversa is considered a vulnerable species."
