    "intro": "Ranunculus udus, commonly known as the water buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It features delicate, bright yellow flowers with five petals, often accompanied by five sepals that resemble petals, giving it a double-flower appearance. The plant thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found near streams, ponds, and marshes. Its leaves are typically palmately lobed and covered in a waxy coating that helps repel water. Ranunculus udus is also notable for its ability to spread via rhizomes, forming dense colonies in its preferred aquatic or semi-aquatic environments."
