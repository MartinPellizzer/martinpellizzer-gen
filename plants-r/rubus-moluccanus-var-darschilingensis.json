It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and produces small, dark purple to black berries. The plant has compound leaves with serrated edges and produces white to pale pink flowers in the spring. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in moist, shaded environments. The berries are edible, though they are typically used in local traditional practices rather than commercial cultivation."
