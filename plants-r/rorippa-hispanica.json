    "intro": "Rorippa hispanica, commonly known as the hispanic watercress, is a flowering plant in the Brassicaceae family. It is a semi-aquatic species that typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and streams. The plant has alternate, heart-shaped leaves that are usually submerged or floating, and small white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. It produces small, round pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by water. Rorippa hispanica is often used in traditional medicine and is also a food plant in some cultures."
