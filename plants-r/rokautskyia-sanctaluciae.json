    "intro": "Rokautskyia sanctaluciae, commonly known as the sacred lily of Saint Lucia, is a rare and striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its large, showy white and purple flowers that bloom during the short summer season. The plant has thick, waxy leaves that help it conserve moisture in its arid environment. Its botanical classification places it within the family Alstroemeriaceae, and it is known for its unique adaptations to high-altitude conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species."
