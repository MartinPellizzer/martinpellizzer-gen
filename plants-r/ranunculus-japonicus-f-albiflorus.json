    "intro": "Ranunculus japonicus f. albiflorus, commonly known as the Japanese buttercup white-flowered form, is a variant of the Japanese buttercup characterized by its pale, almost white flowers. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is native to parts of East Asia, including Japan. The plant typically features showy, solitary flowers with five to seven sepals that are often longer than the petals. Its foliage consists of trifoliate leaves with a hairy texture, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. This form is prized in horticulture for its elegant, contrasting floral display."
