    "intro": "Rhinanthus rumelicus subsp. simonkaianus, commonly known as the yellow rattle, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is often found in grasslands and meadows, where it plays a role in promoting plant diversity by reducing the dominance of certain grass species. Its presence is an indicator of well-managed, biodiverse habitats."
