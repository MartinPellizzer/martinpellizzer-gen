It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, dark red to black berries that are typically edible. It thrives in moist, woodland environments and is often found in the understory of forests. Its botanical features make it an important component of local ecosystems and a subject of study in plant taxonomy."
