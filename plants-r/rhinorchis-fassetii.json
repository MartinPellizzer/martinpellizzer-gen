    "intro": "Rhinorchis fassetii, commonly known as the narrow-leafed orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in late summer. The plant prefers well-drained, acidic soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Rhinorchis fassetii is often found in shaded forest understories, where it forms dense colonies. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
