    "intro": "Rottboellia anthephoroides, commonly known as the African grass or red grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It has a fibrous root system and produces slender, erect stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green color and produces small, pale blue or purple flowers in dense spikelets. It is often found in disturbed soils and is used in some regions for thatching and as a forage crop. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it both a useful and sometimes invasive species in various ecosystems."
