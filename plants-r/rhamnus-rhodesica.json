    "intro": "Rhamnus rhodesica, commonly known as the Rhodes buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows to a height of 2\u20136 meters and is characterized by its dark green, oval-shaped leaves that turn reddish in autumn. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by black, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds and some mammals. Rhamnus rhodesica thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas, rocky slopes, and scrublands. Its hardy nature makes it a resilient plant in Mediterranean climates."
