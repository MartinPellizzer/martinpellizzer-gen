    "intro": "Racinaea hauggiae, commonly known as the Haugg's racinaea, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the cloud forests of Central America. It is characterized by its delicate, elongated leaves and small, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pale pink. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific soil conditions to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts. Its unique morphology and ecological niche make it an important subject for botanical research."
