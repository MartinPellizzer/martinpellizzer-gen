    "intro": "Rubus caesius var. vestitus, commonly known as the velvet raspberry, is a flowering plant species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, velvety pubescence that covers its stems and leaves, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or black when mature, which are edible and have a tart flavor. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks. The botanical features of this variety make it both ornamental and ecologically valuable in its native habitats."
