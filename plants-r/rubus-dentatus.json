It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that ripen to a dark purple or black color. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, and they appear in the spring. Rubus dentatus is often found in woodlands, thickets, and along streambanks, where it thrives in partial shade."
