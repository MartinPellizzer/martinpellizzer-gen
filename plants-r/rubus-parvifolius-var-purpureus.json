    "intro": "Rubus parvifolius var. purpureus, commonly known as the purpleleaf bramble, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves with a distinctive purplish hue, especially on the underside. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, edible berries in the summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
