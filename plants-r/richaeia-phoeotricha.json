    "intro": "Richaeia phoeotricha, commonly known as the coastal beardgrass, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and hairy, grass-like leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in dense spikes, which bloom during the warmer months. Richaeia phoeotricha is adapted to sandy soils and can tolerate salt spray, making it a hardy species found along shorelines. Its ecological role includes providing habitat and food for various insects and small animals."
