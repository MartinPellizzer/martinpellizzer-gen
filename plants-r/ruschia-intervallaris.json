    "intro": "Ruschia intervallaris, commonly known as the mountain fire plant, is a succulent species native to South Africa. It features fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces vibrant orange to red flowers during the winter months, adding a striking visual contrast to its green foliage. Its leaves are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps reduce water loss through evaporation. Ruschia intervallaris is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental appeal."
