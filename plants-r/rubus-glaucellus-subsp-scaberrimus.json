    "intro": "Rubus glaucellus subsp. scaberrimus, commonly known as the scabrous evergreen blackberry, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and dark green, leathery leaves with a distinctive waxy coating. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black when mature. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and streambanks. Its botanical features make it well adapted to its native habitat, though it is relatively uncommon in cultivation."
