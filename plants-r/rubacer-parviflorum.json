    "intro": "Rubacer parviflorum, commonly known as the small-flowered rockrose, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its compact form and hairy, gray-green foliage. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for drought-tolerant landscaping."
