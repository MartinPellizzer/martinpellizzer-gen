It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or black when ripe. It thrives in woodland edges and disturbed soils, often forming dense thickets. Its botanical features make it a common component of hedgerows and forest undergrowth."
