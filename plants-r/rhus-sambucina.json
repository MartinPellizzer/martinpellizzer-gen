    "intro": "Rhus sambucina, commonly known as the European buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Europe. It belongs to the Anacardiaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces dark, glossy berries that are a food source for birds and other wildlife. It is often found in woodland edges, hedgerows, and disturbed soils. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain regions."
