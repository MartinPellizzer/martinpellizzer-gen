    "intro": "Rubus occitanicus subsp. timbal-lagravei, commonly known as the Corsican blackberry, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Corsica and Sardinia. It is characterized by its prickly stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically harvested in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and rocky areas. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and localized species within its range."
