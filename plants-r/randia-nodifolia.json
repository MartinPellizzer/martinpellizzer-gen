    "intro": "Randia nodifolia, commonly known as the clustered randia, is a tropical shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It is characterized by its opposite, elliptic leaves that are usually covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, clustered white or pink flowers, which are followed by distinctive, inflated, yellow or orange berries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and disturbed sites. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
