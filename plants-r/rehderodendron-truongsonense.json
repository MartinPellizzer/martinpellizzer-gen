    "intro": "Rehderodendron truongsonense, commonly known as the Truong Son azalea, is a rare flowering plant native to the Annamite Mountains in Vietnam. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and showy, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, thriving in high-altitude regions. Its flowers, which range in color from white to pink, bloom in spring and are adapted to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable but vulnerable species in conservation efforts."
