    "intro": "Rostkovia brevifolia, commonly known as the short-leaved rostkovia, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and small, lance-shaped leaves that are densely packed along the stem. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically borne on short, erect pedicels. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. Rostkovia brevifolia is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, thriving in cooler, high-altitude environments."
