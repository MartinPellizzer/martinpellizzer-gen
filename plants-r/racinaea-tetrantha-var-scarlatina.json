    "intro": "Racinaea tetrantha var. scarlatina, commonly known as the scarlet racinaea, is a striking member of the Araceae family characterized by its vibrant, colorful inflorescence. This variant is distinguished by its bright red spathe, which contrasts sharply with its green, heart-shaped leaves. Native to tropical regions, it thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in the understory of forests. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers within the spathe, which are pollinated by insects. Its unique appearance and growth habits make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in warm climates."
