    "intro": "Rhamnus petiolaris, commonly known as the narrowleaf buckthorn, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, often spiny stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the branches. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are followed by dark blue, fleshy berries that are an important food source for birds. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in woodlands and along streambanks. Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is sometimes considered a weed in ecological restoration projects."
