    "intro": "Rubus ulmifolius var. belonacanthus, commonly known as the purple-fruited bramble, is a variant of the common blackberry species. It is characterized by its dark purple to almost black berries, which are typically smaller than those of the standard Rubus ulmifolius. The plant is a deciduous shrub with thorny stems and compound leaves that are often lobed and serrated. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges and hedgerows. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and valued species in both horticulture and ecological contexts."
