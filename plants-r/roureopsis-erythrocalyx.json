    "intro": "Roureopsis erythrocalyx, commonly known as the red calyx spurge, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its striking red calyx that persists on the fruit, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. Its small yellow flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it is often found in coastal or mountainous regions. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it requires well-drained soil and full sun."
