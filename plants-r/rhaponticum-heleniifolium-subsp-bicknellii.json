    "intro": "Rhaponticum heleniifolium subsp. bicknellii, commonly known as Bicknell's helenea, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, lobed leaves that resemble those of the genus Helenea. The plant produces showy yellow flowers arranged in a single head, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
