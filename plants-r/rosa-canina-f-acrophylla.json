    "intro": "Rosa canina f. acrophylla, commonly known as the evergreen rose, is a hybrid form of the dog rose. It is characterized by its evergreen foliage, which remains on the plant throughout the year, distinguishing it from the typical deciduous form of Rosa canina. The plant produces fragrant pink or white flowers that bloom in spring and summer. Its stems are generally thornless, and it has a compact, shrub-like growth habit. This variety is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its aesthetic appeal and hardy nature."
