    "intro": "Reseda lanceolata subsp. constricta, commonly known as narrowleaf sickleweed, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It features slender, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to access moisture from deeper soil layers. This subspecies is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a characteristic species of desert scrub ecosystems."
