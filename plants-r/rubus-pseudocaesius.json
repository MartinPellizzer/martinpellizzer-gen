It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, dark purple berries that are typically smaller than those of other blackberry species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Botanically, it is closely related to other Rubus species and is distinguished by its unique fruit color and habitat preferences."
