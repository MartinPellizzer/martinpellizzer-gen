    "intro": "Rosa dumalis var. cinerea, commonly known as the gray rose, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in a fine, powdery bloom. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or alpine settings. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is a popular choice among gardeners seeking drought-resistant plants."
