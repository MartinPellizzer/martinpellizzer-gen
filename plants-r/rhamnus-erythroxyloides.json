    "intro": "Rhamnus erythroxyloides, commonly known as the red-leaf buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Asia, including China and Japan. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often reddish in color, especially during the autumn season. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by small, dark purple berries that are edible for birds but generally unpalatable to humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in forest edges or rocky areas. The species is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its attractive foliage and seasonal color changes."
