    "intro": "Rumex \u00d7 acutus, commonly known as the common dock, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Rumex acetosa (sour dock) and Rumex obtusifolius (broad-leaved dock). It is a perennial plant characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically pollinated by wind. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in wetlands, riverbanks, and disturbed areas. Rumex \u00d7 acutus is known for its medicinal properties and has been used historically for its astringent and anti-inflammatory effects."
