    "intro": "Rhinephyllum graniforme, commonly known as the granulate liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is a small, mat-forming moss that thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocks or soil surfaces. The plant's leaves are typically narrow and elongated, with a distinctive granular texture on the upper surface. It reproduces through spores rather than seeds, and its life cycle includes both gametophyte and sporophyte stages. Rhinephyllum graniforme plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various invertebrates."
