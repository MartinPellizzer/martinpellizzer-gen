    "intro": "Rubus insolitus, commonly known as the evergreen blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is characterized by its thorny stems, trifoliate leaves, and dark purple to black berries that ripen in late summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in coastal chaparral habitats. Its berries are edible, though they are generally smaller and less sweet compared to common blackberries. The plant plays an important ecological role by providing food for wildlife and stabilizing coastal dunes."
