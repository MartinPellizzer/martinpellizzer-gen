    "intro": "Ranunculus crassicaulis, commonly known as the broadstem buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It features a basal rosette of broadly ovate, hairy leaves that are often tinged with reddish hues. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with five broad, petal-like sepals, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
