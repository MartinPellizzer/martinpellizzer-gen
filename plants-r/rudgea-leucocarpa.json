    "intro": "Rudgea leucocarpa, commonly known as white-fruited rudgea, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its slender, woody stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, and are typically white or pale yellow. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, contributing to its propagation in the wild."
