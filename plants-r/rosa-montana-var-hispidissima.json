    "intro": "Rosa montana var. hispidissima, commonly known as the hispidissima rose, is a compact, shrub-like plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features dense, thorny stems covered in a fine, white to grayish pubescence. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are dark green, glossy, and arranged alternately along the stems. This variety is well-suited for rock gardens or as a border plant due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
