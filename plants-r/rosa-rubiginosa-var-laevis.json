    "intro": "Rosa rubiginosa var. laevis, commonly known as the smooth rose or the pink rose, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, thornless stems and clusters of fragrant, pink to red flowers that bloom in spring. The leaves are pinnately compound, with oval, serrated leaflets that are hairy when young. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is well-suited to dry, sunny conditions. It produces small, red berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans."
