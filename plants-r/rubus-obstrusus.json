    "intro": "Rubus obstrusus, commonly known as the rough bramble, is a species of shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces edible berries that are typically red or black in color, though they are often tart and less commonly consumed than other Rubus species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The leaves are simple, ovate, and covered in fine, stiff hairs, contributing to its rough texture."
