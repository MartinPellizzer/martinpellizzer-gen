    "intro": "Ranunculus fluviatilis, commonly known as the water crowfoot, is a aquatic or semi-aquatic plant found in freshwater habitats such as streams, ponds, and wet meadows. It has finely divided, feather-like leaves that float on the water's surface or are submerged, aiding in photosynthesis. The plant produces showy, usually yellow or white flowers with five to eight petals, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its roots are rhizomatous, allowing it to spread and colonize new areas efficiently. Ranunculus fluviatilis plays a vital role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
