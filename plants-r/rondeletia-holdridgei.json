    "intro": "Rondeletia holdridgei, commonly known as the red-flowered rondeletia, is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its vibrant red or orange flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte or a terrestrial shrub, often found in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are usually elliptical and glossy, while the flowers are clustered in inflorescences. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens, though it remains relatively rare in horticultural trade."
