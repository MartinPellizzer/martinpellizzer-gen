It is characterized by its alternate, simple, and often glandular-stipulate leaves that are typically elliptic to ovate in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in cymes, followed by edible, tart berries that are often used in traditional cuisines. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found at elevations between 1,500 and 3,500 meters. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
