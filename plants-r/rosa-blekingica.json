    "intro": "Rosa blekingica, commonly known as the Blekinge rose, is a species native to southern Sweden and parts of northern Germany. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with arching branches and thorny stems. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white, usually blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are compound, consisting of five to seven oval-shaped leaflets, and it has a fibrous root system that helps it thrive in moist, well-drained soils. Rosa blekingica is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical significance in local horticulture."
