The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, followed by edible berries that are typically red or black. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or along streambanks. The smooth currant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
