    "intro": "Ranunculus scythicus, commonly known as the Scythian buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to central and eastern Europe. It features a basal rosette of leaves that are deeply lobed and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with five petals and numerous stamens, typical of the Ranunculaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
