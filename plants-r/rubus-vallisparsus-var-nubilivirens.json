    "intro": "Rubus vallisparsus var. nubilivirens, commonly known as the cloud-green bramble, is a variant of the bramble genus Rubus native to certain regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, thorny growth habit and dark green foliage that often appears silvery under certain light conditions. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits known as drupes, which are typically red or black when mature. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and natural reserves."
