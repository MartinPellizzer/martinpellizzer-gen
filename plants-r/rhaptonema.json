    "intro": "Rhaptonema, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a genus of ferns belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that give it a ghostly appearance, hence its common name. Rhaptonema species are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in shaded, moist environments. The plants have a rhizomatous growth habit, with short, creeping stems that produce both roots and new fronds. Their spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to their reproductive strategy."
