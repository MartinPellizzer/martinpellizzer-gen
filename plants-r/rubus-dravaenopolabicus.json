    "intro": "Rubus dravaenopolabicus, commonly known as the Drava raspberry, is a species of bramble native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or yellow when mature. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial shade, often growing in forested areas. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its range."
