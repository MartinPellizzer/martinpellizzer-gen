    "intro": "Rhus argentea, commonly known as silverleaf sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its pinnately compound leaves, which are covered in fine, silvery-white hairs, giving the plant its common name. The leaves are typically arranged in an alternate pattern along the stems. During the summer, it produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into clusters of red, fuzzy berries. The plant is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
