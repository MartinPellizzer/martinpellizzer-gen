    "intro": "Rhamnus venosa, commonly known as the velvetleaf buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves that are often covered in fine, velvety hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by black, spherical berries that are a food source for various birds and mammals. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas or along streambanks. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain regions."
