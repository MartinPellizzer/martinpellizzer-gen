It is a columnar cactus characterized by its ribbed stems and sparse, often spiny foliage. The plant produces large, showy white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its unique appearance and ecological importance, it is often cultivated in arid gardens and botanical collections."
