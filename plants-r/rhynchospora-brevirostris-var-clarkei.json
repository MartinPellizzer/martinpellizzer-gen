    "intro": "Rhynchospora brevirostris var. clarkei, commonly known as Clarke's narrow-beak sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in southeastern Australia. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, characterized by its grass-like appearance and triangular stems. The plant typically grows in shallow water or damp soils, often in swamps or along riverbanks. Its small, spike-like inflorescences bear numerous tiny, three-ranked flowers, which are adapted for wind pollination. This variant is distinguished by its narrow, elongated leaves and a distinctive beak-like structure at the tip of its flowering spikes."
