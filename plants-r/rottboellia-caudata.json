It features long, narrow leaves and produces striking, plume-like inflorescences that resemble a cock's comb, giving it its common name. The plant is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of light conditions. It is characterized by its fibrous root system and its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes. Rottboellia caudata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping or as a forage plant."
