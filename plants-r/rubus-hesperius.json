    "intro": "Rubus hesperius, commonly known as the Pacific blackberry, is a species of bramble native to western North America. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and thorny stems, which help it climb and spread across rocky and coastal habitats. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black in color, often with a slightly tart flavor. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges and a hairy texture. Rubus hesperius plays an important ecological role by providing food for various wildlife species and contributing to the biodiversity of its native ecosystems."
