    "intro": "Rosa pomifera var. ogensis, commonly known as the Ogasawara rose, is a rare and unique species native to the Ogasawara Islands in Japan. This plant is characterized by its large, fleshy fruits that resemble a pineapple, hence its common name. The leaves are simple and alternate, with a serrated margin, and the plant produces clusters of fragrant white flowers. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
