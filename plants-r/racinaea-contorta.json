    "intro": "Racinaea contorta, commonly known as the twisted racinaea, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the Araceae family, characterized by its unique inflorescence called a spadix, surrounded by a modified leaf known as a spathe. The plant features thick, fleshy stems and broad, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its humid, shaded habitats. Its flowers are small and clustered, producing a distinctive, often fragrant odor to attract pollinators. Racinaea contorta is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained, nutrient-rich substrates."
