    "intro": "Rumex dentatus subsp. nipponicus, commonly known as Japanese dock, is a perennial herb native to East Asia. It typically grows in moist, shady environments such as forests and stream banks. The plant features broad, lobed leaves with a serrated margin, and it produces small, greenish flowers in clusters. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine for their astringent properties. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly smaller leaves and more compact growth compared to the typical R. dentatus."
