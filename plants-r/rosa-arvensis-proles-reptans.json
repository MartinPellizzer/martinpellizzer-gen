    "intro": "Rosa arvensis proles reptans, commonly known as the creeping woodsrose, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with stems that spread along the ground and produce numerous small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant has compound leaves with five to seven leaflets, and its flowers typically bloom in late spring to early summer. Rosa arvensis proles reptans is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and waste areas, and is considered a weed in some regions. It plays a role in supporting pollinators and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
