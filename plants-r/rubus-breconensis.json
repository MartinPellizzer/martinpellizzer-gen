    "intro": "Rubus breconensis, commonly known as the Brecon blackberry, is a rare and native British species belonging to the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, dark purple to black berries. The plant typically grows in woodland margins and damp grasslands, preferring shady, moist conditions. Its flowers are white with five petals and appear in early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in the UK."
