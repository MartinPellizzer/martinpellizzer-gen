    "intro": "Rhodoleia subcordata, commonly known as the broad-leaved rhodoleia, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia, including China, Korea, and Japan. It belongs to the family Rhodoleiaceae and is characterized by its simple, ovate to elliptical leaves that are often pubescent beneath. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters during late spring to early summer, followed by bright red, fleshy berries that are attractive to birds. Its ornamental value is due to its vibrant foliage and showy flowers, making it a popular choice for garden cultivation. Rhodoleia subcordata is also valued for its ecological role in supporting local wildlife and its potential in horticultural research."
