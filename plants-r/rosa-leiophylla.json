    "intro": "Rosa leiophylla, commonly known as the smooth-leaf rose, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is native to the coastal regions of southern California and northern Baja California. This shrub typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet and features dense, thornless stems. Its leaves are elliptical and have a smooth, waxy texture, which helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. The plant produces fragrant pink to red flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
