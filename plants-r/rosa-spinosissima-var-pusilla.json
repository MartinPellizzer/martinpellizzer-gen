It features small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink to white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has thorny stems and dark green, oval-shaped leaves with serrated edges. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or borders. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for small garden spaces."
