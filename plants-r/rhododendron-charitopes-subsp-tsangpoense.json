    "intro": "Rhododendron charitopes subsp. tsangpoense, commonly known as the Tsangpo rhododendron, is a species native to the eastern Himalayas. It is characterized by its evergreen leaves and showy, tubular flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest understories at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters. Its floral structure is adapted for pollination by long-tongued insects such as bees and butterflies. The subspecies is distinguished by its distinct leaf shape and floral morphology compared to other members of the charitopes species group."
