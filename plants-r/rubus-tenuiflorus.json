    "intro": "Rubus tenuiflorus, commonly known as the slender-flowered blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its thorny stems, trifoliate leaves, and small, dark purple to black berries that ripen in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its flowers are pale green with five petals and are borne in clusters. The fruit is edible, though often described as having a tart and somewhat bitter flavor."
