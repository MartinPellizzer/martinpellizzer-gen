    "intro": "Rumex limosus, commonly known as common sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features alternate, heart-shaped leaves that are often reddish at the base and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in spring. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in wet meadows, stream banks, and woodland areas. The leaves are edible but contain oxalic acid, which can be toxic in large quantities."
