    "intro": "Rebutia calliantha, commonly known as the golden crown cactus, is a species of flowering cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are often covered in dense, white or pale blue spines. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the summer months, which bloom at the ends of the stems. Rebutia calliantha is a compact, slow-growing cactus that thrives in well-draining soil and full sun. It is relatively drought-tolerant and requires minimal water once established."
