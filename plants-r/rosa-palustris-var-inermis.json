It features slender, often hairless stems and elliptic to ovate leaves with finely serrated margins. The plant produces showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its flowers are typically borne singly or in small clusters at the ends of the branches. This variety is adapted to moist soils and is often found in riparian zones and along the edges of ponds and lakes."
