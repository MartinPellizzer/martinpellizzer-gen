It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that develop into red, raspberry-like fruits. Its growth habit includes arching stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense thickets. The thimbleberry is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in some traditional herbal remedies."
