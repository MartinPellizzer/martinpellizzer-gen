It features striking, dark green, heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture due to dense pubescence. The plant produces tall, spiky inflorescences with showy, orange-red flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Roscoea pubescens is a member of the Zingiberaceae family, which includes gingers and turmeric."
