    "intro": "Rubus macrophyllus praestabilis, commonly known as the large-leaf blackberry, is a shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its large, serrated leaves and prickly stems, which are typical features of the Rubus genus. The plant produces aggregate fruits composed of tiny drupes, which are usually dark purple to black when ripe. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and thickets. The botanical interest of this species lies in its morphological variability and ecological adaptability."
