    "intro": "Rhynchostylis, commonly known as the fragrant orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are native to Southeast Asia, including regions such as India, China, and the Philippines. They are characterized by their tall, often branched stems and showy, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white, yellow, and pink. Rhynchostylis species are epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants without being parasitic, and they require bright, indirect light for optimal growth. Their unique floral structure and pleasant aroma make them popular among orchid enthusiasts."
