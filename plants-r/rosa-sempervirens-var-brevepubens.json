    "intro": "Rosa sempervirens var. brevepubens, commonly known as the dwarf evergreen rose, is a compact shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage that remains evergreen throughout the year. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its slow growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. The variety is distinguished by its shorter, more compact growth compared to other Rosa sempervirens cultivars."
