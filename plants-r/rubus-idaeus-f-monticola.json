    "intro": "Rubus idaeus f. monticola, commonly known as the alpine raspberry, is a botanical variant of the common raspberry. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and smaller, more intensely flavored berries compared to the standard Rubus idaeus. This form thrives in cooler, high-altitude environments, often found in mountainous regions. Its leaves are typically more serrated and have a slightly hairy texture. The plant is valued for its hardiness and unique flavor profile, making it a favorite among foragers and gardeners in alpine climates."
