    "intro": "Rosa caesia subsp. subcollina, commonly known as the alpine rose, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense, thornless stems. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the plant is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Rosa caesia subsp. subcollina is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in cooler climates."
