    "intro": "Rhabdothamnopsis chinensis, commonly known as Chinese flatworm fern, is a rare and lesser-known fern species native to China. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, creeping rhizomes and small, orbicular to lanceolate leaves. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in mountainous regions with rich, well-drained soil. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a smooth texture, with sporangia clustered in sori on the underside of the leaves. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
