    "intro": "Ruellia difformis, commonly known as the variable ruellia, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of blue, purple, or white, which bloom from spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded to partially sunny environments. Ruellia difformis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
