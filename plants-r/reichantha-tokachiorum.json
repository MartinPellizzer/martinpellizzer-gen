    "intro": "Reichantha tokachiorum, commonly known as the Tokachi Reichantha, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to Japan. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes buckwheat and sorrel. The plant features slender, upright stems with small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It produces clusters of tiny, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native environment."
