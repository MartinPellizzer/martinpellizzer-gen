    "intro": "Ruizterania esmeraldae, commonly known as the Emerald Beauty, is a strikingly ornamental plant native to the cloud forests of Costa Rica. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are often tinged with a bluish sheen, giving it a unique visual appeal. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, adding to its ornamental value. Ruizterania esmeraldae thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, nutrient-rich soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
