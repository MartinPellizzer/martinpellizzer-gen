    "intro": "Renanthera lowii, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features showy, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or orange with a reddish lip. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the surrounding soil. Renanthera lowii is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and greenhouses."
