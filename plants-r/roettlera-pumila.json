    "intro": "Roettlera pumila, commonly known as the dwarf roettlera, is a small, flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its foliage is often covered in fine, hairy structures, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Roettlera pumila is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
