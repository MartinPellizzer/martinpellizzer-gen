It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often covered in a waxy, bluish coating. The plant produces small yellow flowers arranged in dense, globular clusters. It is adapted to arid environments and has a deep root system for water retention. Racosperma glaucopterum is often found in coastal and sandy soils, and it plays a role in stabilizing dunes."
