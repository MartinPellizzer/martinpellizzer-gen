    "intro": "Rapuntium cheiranthifolium, commonly known as the rock cress, is a flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or arctic regions. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a fine layer of hairs, which helps reduce water loss. The seeds are enclosed in small, capsule-like structures that release them upon maturity."
