The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. It is often found in rocky habitats and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. The species is also noted for its ecological importance, providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for small wildlife."
