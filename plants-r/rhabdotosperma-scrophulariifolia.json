It belongs to the family Scrophulariaceae, which includes many species with showy, often tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and often hairy, and it produces small, pale flowers that bloom in spring. It is not widely cultivated but is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
