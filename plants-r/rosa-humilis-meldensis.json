    "intro": "Rosa humilis meldensis, commonly known as the Meldens rose, is a compact, shrub-like species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has dark green, serrated leaves and a bushy growth habit, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a decorative shrub. It is drought-tolerant and prefers well-drained soil, though it can adapt to a variety of environmental conditions. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to produce repeat blooms throughout the growing season."
