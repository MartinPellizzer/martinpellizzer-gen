It features short, cylindrical stems that are typically green with a waxy coating. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red during the spring and summer months. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, requiring minimal water to prevent root rot. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
