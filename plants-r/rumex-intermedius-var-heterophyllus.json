    "intro": "Rumex intermedius var. heterophyllus, commonly known as the variable dock, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and can be found in meadows, woodland edges, and stream banks. The plant features alternate, serrated leaves that vary in shape and size across different parts of the plant, giving it its varietal name. It produces small, greenish flowers in dense clusters during the spring and early summer. The species is notable for its morphological variability, which can make identification challenging without careful examination."
