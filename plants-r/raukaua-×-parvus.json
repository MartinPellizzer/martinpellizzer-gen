    "intro": "Raukaua \u00d7 parvus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved k\u014dwhai, is a hybrid plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its slender, often drooping stems and small, bipinnate leaves. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in racemes, attracting native pollinators such as bees and birds. Its growth habit is typically shrub-like, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments within forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in New Zealand's native gardens."
