    "intro": "Rubus sciocharis, commonly known as the narrowleaf blackberry, is a species of brambles native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, dark berries that are typically edible, though they are often overshadowed by more commercially popular blackberry varieties. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and less cultivated species within the Rubus genus."
