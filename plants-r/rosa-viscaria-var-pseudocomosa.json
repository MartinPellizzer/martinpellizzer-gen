    "intro": "Rosa viscaria var. pseudocomosa, commonly known as the creeping rose, is a low-growing shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features fragrant, semi-double pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has trailing stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets. This variety is well-suited for rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its compact growth habit."
