    "intro": "Rhynchospora globosa var. epiglobosa, commonly known as the globular spike-rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of North America. It is characterized by its dense, globular inflorescence composed of small, spike-like clusters of flowers. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its leaves are grass-like, narrow, and often clasping the stem, contributing to its overall compact growth form. The species is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
