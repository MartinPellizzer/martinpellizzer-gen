    "intro": "Ranunculus minutiflorus var. miser, commonly known as the dwarf buttercup, is a delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features small, yellow flowers with five petals, typically less than 1 inch in diameter, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky soils. It is a member of the Ranunculaceae family, known for its showy blooms and often toxic sap. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
