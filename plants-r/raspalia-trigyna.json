    "intro": "Raspalia trigyna, commonly known as the three-lobed saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of thick, fleshy leaves that are typically lobed or toothed. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers with five petals, which bloom in the spring. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine environments. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
