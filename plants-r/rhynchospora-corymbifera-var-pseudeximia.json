    "intro": "Rhynchospora corymbifera var. pseudeximia, commonly known as the slender swamp cord-grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, contributing to soil stabilization in aquatic environments. It plays an important ecological role in supporting aquatic and wetland biodiversity."
