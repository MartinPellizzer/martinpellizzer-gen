    "intro": "Ranunculus infestus, commonly known as the hairy buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features a basal rosette of hairy, lobed leaves and produces showy yellow flowers with five petals. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in wet soils and its preference for partial to full shade. Ranunculus infestus is often found in disturbed habitats and can be an indicator of soil moisture conditions."
