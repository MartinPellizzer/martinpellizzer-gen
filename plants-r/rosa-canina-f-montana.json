    "intro": "Rosa canina f. montana, commonly known as the mountain dog rose, is a horticultural form of the dog rose. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and profuse flowering, typically producing bright pink to red blooms. The plant is native to the mountainous regions of Europe and is adapted to cooler, high-altitude environments. Its foliage is dark green and slightly hairy, and the hips are smaller and more numerous compared to the typical dog rose. This form is valued in gardens for its ornamental value and hardy nature."
