    "intro": "Roemeria argemonoides, commonly known as the redroot valerian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, aromatic stems that often grow in dense clusters, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a hairy texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or red in color, blooming from late spring to early summer. Its root system is thick and fleshy, which helps it survive in dry conditions. Roemeria argemonoides is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens or dry soil environments."
