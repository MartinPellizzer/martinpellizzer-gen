    "intro": "Rhynchospora corymbosa var. asperula, commonly known as the rough spikegrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy habitats in North America. It features erect, hairless stems that bear whorled clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences with small, greenish-white flowers that are typically wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies in moist soils. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
