    "intro": "Rhododendron makinoi var. roseum, commonly known as the Makino's rose-flowered rhododendron, is a deciduous shrub native to Japan. It features showy, semi-double flowers that are typically pink to rose-red in color, blooming in early spring. The plant has broad, ovate leaves that are dark green and glossy, providing a striking contrast to its floral display. It prefers acidic, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and long-lasting blooms."
