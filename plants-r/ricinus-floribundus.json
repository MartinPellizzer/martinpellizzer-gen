    "intro": "Ricinus floribundus, commonly known as the flowering castor plant, is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its large, palmate leaves and showy, red bracts that enclose its small yellow flowers. The plant produces a toxic seed capsule containing seeds with a high oil content, which can be processed into castor oil. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its striking appearance. However, it requires careful handling due to the presence of toxic compounds in its sap and seeds."
