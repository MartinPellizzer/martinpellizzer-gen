    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus subsp. fissifolius, commonly known as the fissured leaf buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features delicate, palmately divided leaves and yellow flowers with five to seven petals. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and stream banks. Its subspecies is distinguished by its deeply lobed leaves and smaller, more compact flowers compared to the typical form. It is considered an early bloomer, often appearing in spring."
