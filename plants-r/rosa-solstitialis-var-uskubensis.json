    "intro": "Rosa solstitialis var. uskubensis, commonly known as the Uskubian sun rose, is a rare and ornamental plant native to the Balkan region. It is characterized by its vibrant red flowers that bloom in late spring, typically around the summer solstice, giving it its common name. The plant features upright, thorny stems and dark green, serrated leaves that are lance-shaped. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
