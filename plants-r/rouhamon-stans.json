The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, and its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from rocky soil. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its unique beauty and ecological significance, it is a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists alike."
