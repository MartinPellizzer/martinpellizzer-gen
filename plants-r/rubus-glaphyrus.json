It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces aggregate fruits, commonly referred to as berries, which are bright red when mature. These berries are edible, though they are typically tart and often used in jams and syrups. Botanically, it belongs to the Rosaceae family and is closely related to other raspberry and blackberry species."
