    "intro": "Rubus chrysogaeus, commonly known as the golden raspberry, is a species of bramble native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and hairy stems, which help it climb and spread across vegetation. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible berries that are typically red or orange in color. Its leaves are compound, consisting of three to five leaflets, and are often covered in fine hairs. Rubus chrysogaeus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance and fruit."
