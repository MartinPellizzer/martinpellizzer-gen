    "intro": "Rubus arenicola, commonly known as the sand raspberry, is a perennial shrub native to the coastal regions of the western United States. It thrives in sandy and gravelly soils, often found in dunes and coastal bluffs. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible but have a tart flavor. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and its stems are covered in fine, stiff hairs. Rubus arenicola plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
