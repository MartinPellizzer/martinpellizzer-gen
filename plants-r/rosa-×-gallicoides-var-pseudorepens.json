    "intro": "Rosa \u00d7 gallicoides var. pseudorepens, commonly known as the creeping gallic rose, is a hybrid shrub native to the temperate regions of Europe. It is characterized by its low-growing, spreading habit with thorny stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to form dense mats. The plant produces fragrant, pink to red flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with ovate to elliptical leaflets that are serrated along the edges. This species is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
