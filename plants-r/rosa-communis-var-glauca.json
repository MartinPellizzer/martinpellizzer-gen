    "intro": "Rosa communis var. glauca, commonly known as the blue rose, is a botanical variety of the rose plant that is notable for its unique bluish-pink flower color. This coloration is due to the presence of a pigment called delphinidin, which is not typically found in common roses. The plant is a shrub with thorny stems and compound leaves, typical of the Rosa genus. It produces fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it is relatively rare in cultivation and is often grown for its ornamental value."
