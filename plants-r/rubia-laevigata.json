    "intro": "Rubia laevigata, commonly known as the velvetleaf or European hogweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, dark green leaves and clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces a milky sap that can cause skin irritation, and its roots are often used in traditional medicine. Rubia laevigata thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and potentially hazardous to handle."
