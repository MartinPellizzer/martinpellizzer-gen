    "intro": "Ranunculus pseudopsis, commonly known as the alpine buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It features delicate, bright yellow flowers with deeply lobed petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has a short, hairy stem and basal leaves that are palmately divided. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and grasslands. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it prefers cool, moist conditions."
