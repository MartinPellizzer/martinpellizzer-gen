    "intro": "Ricinus communis f. nigrescens, commonly known as the blackleaf castor, is a cultivar of the castor oil plant characterized by its dark green, almost black foliage. It is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Africa. The plant produces striking red to orange flowers that are followed by spiny, three-lobed seed capsules. While it shares the same basic structure as the common castor plant, its unique leaf color makes it a popular ornamental species. It is often grown in gardens for its aesthetic appeal rather than for its oil-producing capabilities."
