    "intro": "Ritchiea heterophylla, commonly known as the variable leaf cycad, is a rare and unique cycad species native to the tropical rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its distinct variation in leaf morphology, with leaves that can be either pinnate or bipinnate depending on the plant's age and environmental conditions. The plant produces large, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of cycads. Its slow growth rate and limited distribution make it a conservation concern. Due to its ecological significance and ornamental value, Ritchiea heterophylla is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
