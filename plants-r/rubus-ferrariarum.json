    "intro": "Rubus ferrariarum, commonly known as the Ferrari raspberry, is a species of brambles native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, red, edible fruits that ripen in late summer. The plant produces compound leaves with serrated edges and has a generally shrub-like growth habit. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and somewhat obscure member of the Rubus genus."
