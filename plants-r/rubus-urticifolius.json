    "intro": "Rubus urticifolius, commonly known as the stinging bramble, is a shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its prickly stems and leaves covered in stinging hairs. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits known as drupes, which are typically red or black in color. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including woodlands, hedgerows, and disturbed soils. Due to its defensive mechanisms, it is often difficult to handle without protection."
