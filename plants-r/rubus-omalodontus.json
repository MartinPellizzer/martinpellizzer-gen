    "intro": "Rubus omalodontus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved blackberry, is a species of bramble native to parts of eastern North America. It is characterized by its dark, thorny stems and small, elliptical leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces aggregate fruits composed of tiny, dark purple to black drupelets. It thrives in moist, wooded areas and is often found in the understory of mixed hardwood forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
