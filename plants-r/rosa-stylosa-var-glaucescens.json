    "intro": "Rosa stylosa var. glaucescens, commonly known as the glaucous pink or glaucous evergreen rose, is a variant of the evergreen rose species native to southern China. It is characterized by its glossy, bluish-green foliage and semi-evergreen habit, which allows it to retain its leaves throughout much of the year. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, pink flowers that bloom in spring and summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for temperate climates. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal and hardiness."
