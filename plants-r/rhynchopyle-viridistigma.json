    "intro": "Rhynchopyle viridistigma, commonly known as the green-stigma rhynchopyle, is a rare and specialized plant species belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its slender, herbaceous stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in woodland or streamside habitats. Its leaves are finely divided and arranged in a basal rosette, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
