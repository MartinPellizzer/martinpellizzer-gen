    "intro": "Rhus tessellata, commonly known as the glossy buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It features compound leaves with serrated edges and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in early spring. The plant produces red, fleshy berries that are a food source for birds and other wildlife. Its adaptability to various soil types and full sun makes it a common sight in woodland edges and thickets. However, it can become invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seed dispersal."
