    "intro": "Robinia pseudoacacia var. pendulifolia, commonly known as the weeping false acacia, is a cultivar of the black locust tree characterized by its cascading, drooping branches. It features compound leaves that are pinnately arranged, with oval-shaped leaflets that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces fragrant, yellowish-white flowers in racemes during the spring, which are followed by flat, pod-like fruits. It is native to the United States but has been widely cultivated in temperate regions for its ornamental value. This variety is often used in landscaping due to its distinctive appearance and adaptability to various soil types."
