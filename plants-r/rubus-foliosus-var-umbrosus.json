    "intro": "Rubus foliosus var. umbrosus, commonly known as the shade raspberry. This variant of the raspberry plant is characterized by its dense, dark foliage and smaller, more rounded leaves compared to the typical raspberry. It thrives in shaded environments, making it well-suited for woodland or garden areas with limited sunlight. The plant produces small, tart berries that are often less commercially viable than those of other Rubus species. Its botanical features include a thorny stem, compound leaves, and a bracteate inflorescence typical of the Rubus genus."
