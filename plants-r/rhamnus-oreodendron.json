    "intro": "Rhamnus oreodendron, commonly known as the Sierra cedar or desert cedar, is a shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color and covered in a fine, white wax. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in axillary inflorescences, followed by small, leathery berries that are reddish when mature. Its bark is often fissured and reddish-brown, and it has a deep root system that allows it to thrive in arid and rocky environments. Rhamnus oreodendron is adapted to drought conditions and is often found in chaparral and desert scrub habitats."
