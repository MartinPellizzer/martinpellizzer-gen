    "intro": "Rosa biebersteiniana, commonly known as the Siberian rose, is a deciduous shrub native to the cold climates of Siberia and northern China. It features woody stems with thorny branches and elliptical, dark green leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces fragrant, pink to white flowers in early summer, which are typically single or semi-double. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in harsh, cold environments. Rosa biebersteiniana is also cultivated for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions and its resilience to extreme weather."
