    "intro": "Rosa canina f. armata, commonly known as the armed dog rose, is a botanical variant of the dog rose. It is characterized by its distinctive thorned stems and dense, prickly growth habit. The plant produces pale pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring. Its hips, which are the fruit, are typically smaller and more numerous than those of the typical Rosa canina. This form is often found in woodland edges and scrub habitats across Europe."
