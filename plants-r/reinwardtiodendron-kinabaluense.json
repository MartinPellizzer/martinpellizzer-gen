    "intro": "Reinwardtiodendron kinabaluense, commonly known as the Kinabalu reinwardtiodendron, is a rare flowering plant native to the montane rainforests of Mount Kinabalu in Borneo. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its unique, elongated leaves and striking, lantern-like inflorescences. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments at high altitudes, typically between 1,500 and 2,500 meters above sea level. Its flowers are small and clustered, often surrounded by specialized bracts that contribute to its ornamental appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species facing threats from deforestation and climate change."
