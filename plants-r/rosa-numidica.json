    "intro": "Rosa numidica, commonly known as the Algerian rose or Numidian rose, is a deciduous shrub native to North Africa. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of fragrant, pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges, and its flowers are often used in perfumery due to their strong scent. Rosa numidica is adapted to arid climates and requires well-drained soil to thrive. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
