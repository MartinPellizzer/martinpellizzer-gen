It is characterized by its thorny stems and trifoliate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or yellow when ripe. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including woodlands, hedgerows, and disturbed soils. Due to its hardy nature, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and garden settings."
