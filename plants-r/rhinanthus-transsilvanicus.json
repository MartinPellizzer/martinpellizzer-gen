    "intro": "Rhinanthus transsilvanicus, commonly known as the Transylvanian yellowtop, is a flowering plant native to Europe, particularly found in grasslands and open woodlands. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family, which includes parasitic and hemiparasitic plants. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting various pollinators. Its roots form a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, aiding in nutrient absorption. Rhinanthus transsilvanicus is also known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils, making it an important indicator species for certain ecosystems."
