    "intro": "Rhamnoluma, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by oval, woody fruits containing flat, winged seeds. Rhamnoluma is often found in wetlands and along riverbanks, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it both a useful forage plant and a potential invasive species in certain environments."
