It typically grows in brackish and freshwater environments, often found in marshes, estuaries, and shallow coastal waters. The plant has long, ribbon-like leaves that are usually arranged in whorls around the stem. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are pollinated by wind or water. Ruppia sinensis plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
