    "intro": "Rudbeckia heliopsidis, commonly known as the yellow coneflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features upright, hairy stems that bear large, daisy-like yellow-orange flower heads with dark brown central cones. The plant produces showy, composite flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped, rough to the touch, and often have a reddish or purple tinge beneath. Rudbeckia heliopsidis thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for native gardens."
