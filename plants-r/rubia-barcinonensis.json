    "intro": "Rubia barcinonensis, commonly known as the Baiona balm, is a rare flowering plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and is found in specific microhabitats, making it highly susceptible to environmental changes. Its leaves are opposite and oval-shaped, with a smooth texture, while its flowers are usually pink or white. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Rubia barcinonensis is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
