    "intro": "Rhinanthus freynii var. croaticus, commonly known as the Croatian yellowtop, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and the Middle East. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, characterized by its parasitic nature and lack of chlorophyll. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as grasslands and roadsides. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
