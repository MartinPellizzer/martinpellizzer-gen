    "intro": "Rhynchospora aristata var. immensa, commonly known as the giant marsh sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters, making it one of the tallest sedges in its native range. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences composed of small, three-lobed flowers, which are typically greenish or reddish in color. It thrives in moist to aquatic environments, such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its presence is often an indicator of healthy, undisturbed wetland ecosystems."
