    "intro": "Ramirezella calcoma, commonly known as the Mexican flame tree, is a species of flowering plant native to Mexico and Central America. It belongs to the Bignoniaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy orange-red flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is deciduous, shedding its leaves seasonally, and features opposite, simple, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy surface. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and urban landscapes, though it can be invasive in some regions. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its spread."
