    "intro": "Rosa cerasocarpa, commonly known as the cherry-cheeked rose, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in countries like China, Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan. The plant is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and covered in a fine layer of white pubescence. The fruit, known as a hip, is red and contains achenes, which are dispersed by wind, aiding in the plant's propagation."
