    "intro": "Rajania cordata var. scorpioidea, commonly known as the scorpion's tail orchid, is a unique orchid species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, elongated inflorescence that resembles a scorpion's tail, giving it its common name. The plant features dense clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink, which bloom during the rainy season. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern, contributing to its ornamental appeal. This orchid thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
