    "intro": "Rosa squarrosa var. gracilescens, commonly known as the slender sand rose, is a compact, low-growing shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It features wiry, often reddish stems covered in fine, grayish hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink to white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and linear, arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems, and are also covered in a dense layer of fine pubescence. This variety is well adapted to sandy soils and is often found in coastal dunes or rocky habitats."
