    "intro": "Ribes divaricatum var. rigidum, commonly known as the stiff currant, is a deciduous shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and dark green, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in clusters during late spring, which are followed by edible red berries in the summer. Its berries are used in jams and jellies, and the plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight."
