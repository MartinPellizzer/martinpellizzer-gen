It is native to regions of Europe and Asia, typically found in woodland edges and rocky areas. The plant produces dark purple to black berries that are edible, though often tart and less commonly consumed than other blackberry species. Its leaves are palmately lobed, with a distinctive fissured appearance on the underside. The plant is valued for its ornamental value and for its role in supporting local wildlife."
