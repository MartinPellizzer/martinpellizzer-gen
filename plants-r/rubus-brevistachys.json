    "intro": "Rubus brevistachys, commonly known as the short-stemmed blackberry, is a species of brambles native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its thorny stems, trifoliate leaves, and small, dark purple berries that ripen in late summer. The plant thrives in moist, wooded areas and is often found in the understory of deciduous forests. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, and they bloom in early spring. The fruit of Rubus brevistachys is edible but has a tart flavor, making it a valuable plant for both ecological and culinary purposes."
