    "intro": "Rollinia broadwayi var. cuneata, commonly known as the broadway cuneata, is a variant of the Rollinia genus native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its broad, elliptical leaves that are often glossy and dark green in color. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible, sweet, and fleshy berries. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and fruit. The cuneata variety is distinguished by its slightly pointed leaf shape, which sets it apart from other Rollinia species."
