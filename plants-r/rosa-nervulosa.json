    "intro": "Rosa nervulosa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf rose, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy leaves and fragrant pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Native to regions of Europe and western Asia, this plant typically grows in woodland edges and rocky habitats. The plant produces small, red berries that contain seeds, which are dispersed by birds. Rosa nervulosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in perfumery."
