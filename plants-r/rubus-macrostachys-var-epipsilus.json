    "intro": "Rubus macrostachys var. epipsilus, commonly known as the giant blackberry or epipsilus blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its large, dark purple to black berries that are typically larger than those of other Rubus species. The plant produces compound leaves with serrated edges and has thorny stems typical of the Rubus genus. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in moist, shaded environments. The berries are edible, though they are generally more tart and less commonly cultivated compared to other blackberry varieties."
