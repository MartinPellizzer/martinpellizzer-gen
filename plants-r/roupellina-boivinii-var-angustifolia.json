It is a shrub or small tree characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, round fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a warm, humid climate. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists."
