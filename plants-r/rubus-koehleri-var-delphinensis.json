It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and produces small, dark purple to black berries. The plant features trifoliate leaves with serrated margins and produces white to pale pink flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and lesser-known species within the Rubus family."
