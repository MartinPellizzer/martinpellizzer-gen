    "intro": "Rosa palustris f. nuttalliana, commonly known as the Nuttall's swamp rose, is a botanical variant of the swamp rose native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its pale pink to white flowers and hairy stems adapted to moist environments. The plant typically grows in marshes, bogs, and along the edges of ponds, thriving in poorly drained soils. Its leaves are alternate, serrated, and often covered with fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. This form is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for pollinators."
