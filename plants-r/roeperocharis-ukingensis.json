    "intro": "Roeperocharis ukingensis, commonly known as the Ukinge's orchid, is a rare and endemic species found in the montane forests of eastern Africa. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in the spring. The plant has a short rhizome and produces narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to its shady, humid habitat. Its flowers are usually pale green or white, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
