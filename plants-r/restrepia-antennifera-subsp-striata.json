    "intro": "Restrepia antennifera subsp. striata, commonly known as the striated lady's slipper orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive violet to purple coloration and a unique, slipper-shaped pouch. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its humid, shaded habitat. Its leaves are dark green and leathery, adapted to retain moisture in its high-altitude environment. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts."
