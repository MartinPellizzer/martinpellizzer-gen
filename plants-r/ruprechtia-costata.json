    "intro": "Ruprechtia costata, commonly known as the mountain snowbell, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its cold-hardy nature. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
