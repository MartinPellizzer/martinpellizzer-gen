    "intro": "Ruppia maritima var. drepanensis, commonly known as the Mediterranean sea rush, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments. It thrives in coastal areas, estuaries, and brackish water habitats, often forming dense underwater vegetation. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that are typically branched and bear small, scale-like leaves. It produces tiny, yellowish flowers that are pollinated by wind, and its seeds are dispersed by water. This variety is important for stabilizing sediments and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
