    "intro": "Rosa viscaria var. dolorosa, commonly known as the sorrowful rose, is a variant of the shrub rose native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its dark, almost black, thorned stems and deep crimson flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has small, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy texture, and its fragrance is described as both sweet and melancholic. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its rarity and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in specialized gardens."
