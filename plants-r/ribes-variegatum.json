    "intro": "Ribes variegatum, commonly known as the variegated gooseberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often variegated with white or yellow markings, and its clusters of small, yellowish-green berries. The plant is part of the Grossulariaceae family and is known for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes. The berries are edible but are typically used in jams and preserves rather than eaten fresh."
