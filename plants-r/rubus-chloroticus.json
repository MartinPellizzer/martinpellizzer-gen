    "intro": "Rubus chloroticus, commonly known as the yellow blackberry, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its yellowish fruits, which are smaller and less common than those of other Rubus species. The plant typically grows in temperate regions and thrives in well-drained soils. Its leaves are usually trifoliate, with a serrated edge, and it produces small white flowers in the spring. Due to its limited distribution and unique coloration, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists."
