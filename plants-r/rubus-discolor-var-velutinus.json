    "intro": "Rubus discolor var. velutinus, commonly known as the velvet raspberry, is a variant of the discolor raspberry native to parts of Asia. It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or yellow when mature. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges or disturbed soils. Its hairy texture, particularly on the stems and leaves, gives it its common name."
