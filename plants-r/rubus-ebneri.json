It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black in color. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in rocky or forested habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and less commonly cultivated species."
