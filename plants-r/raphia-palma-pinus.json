    "intro": "Raphia palma-pinus, commonly known as the African fan-palm, is a large, tropical plant native to parts of Africa. It is characterized by its massive, fan-shaped leaves that can reach several meters in diameter. The plant produces tall, slender stems that grow from a rhizome system, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically appearing in pendulous inflorescences. The fruit is a spiny, fibrous structure that contains a single seed, which is dispersed by animals."
