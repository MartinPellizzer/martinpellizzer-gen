    "intro": "Rhynchospora marisculus var. elatior, commonly known as the salt marsh beakspur, is a herbaceous plant native to coastal regions of the United States. It typically grows in saline or brackish wetlands, thriving in conditions of high salinity and fluctuating water levels. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and colonize new areas along the shoreline. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
