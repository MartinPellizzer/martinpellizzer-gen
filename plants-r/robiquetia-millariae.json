    "intro": "Robiquetia millariae, commonly known as the Cape mountain orchid, is a rare and endemic species found primarily in the Western Cape region of South Africa. It is a small, terrestrial orchid with a compact growth habit, typically producing one to three erect, hairy stems. The plant features lance-shaped leaves and produces delicate, pale yellow to greenish-white flowers with a distinctive, spurred lip. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the Mediterranean climate of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
