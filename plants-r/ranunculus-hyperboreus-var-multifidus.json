It features a short, creeping rhizome and produces delicate, yellow flowers with five to eight sepals that resemble petals. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a distinctive, finely toothed margin. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptation to extreme climates."
