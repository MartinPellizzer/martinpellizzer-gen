It features grass-like leaves and produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange. The plant thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. It is adapted to seasonal flooding and has a short growing season. Its bulbs serve as storage organs, allowing it to survive periods of drought."
