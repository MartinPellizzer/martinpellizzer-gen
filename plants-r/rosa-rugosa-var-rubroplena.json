    "intro": "Rosa rugosa var. rubroplena, commonly known as the red-flowered rugosa rose, is a deciduous shrub native to coastal regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its rugged, thorny stems and large, fragrant flowers that range from pale yellow to deep red. The plant produces showy, semi-double blooms in late spring to early summer, often with a distinctive red or pink coloration. Its foliage is dark green and glossy, providing an attractive contrast to the vibrant flowers. This hardy species is well-suited to coastal and saline environments due to its salt tolerance and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
