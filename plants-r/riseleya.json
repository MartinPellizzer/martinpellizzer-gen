    "intro": "Riseleya, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and fascinating epiphytic plant native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance with pale green or white flowers. The plant lacks leaves and instead absorbs moisture and nutrients through its roots, which are adapted to grow on tree trunks or branches. Riseleya is known for its elusive nature, making it one of the most sought-after and difficult-to-cultivate orchids. Its conservation status is vulnerable due to habitat destruction and limited natural distribution."
