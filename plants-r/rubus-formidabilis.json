    "intro": "Rubus formidabilis, commonly known as the fearsome raspberry, is a species of bramble native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its thorny stems and aggregate fruits, which are typically red or black when mature. The plant produces small, white flowers in early spring, followed by the development of its edible berries in late summer. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the plant is often found in moist, shaded habitats. Due to its aggressive growth, it is considered a potential invasive species in some areas."
