    "intro": "Rubus rudiformis, commonly known as the rough bramble, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is native to parts of Europe and Asia, where it typically grows in woodland edges and disturbed soils. The plant is characterized by its prickly stems and clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers. Its fruit, a red, raspberry-like aggregate, is edible but often tart. Rubus rudiformis plays a role in supporting local wildlife, particularly insects and birds."
