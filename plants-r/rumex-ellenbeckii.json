    "intro": "Rumex ellenbeckii, commonly known as Ellenbeck's sorrel, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its upright stems and heart-shaped leaves with a reddish tint. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typical of the Polygonaceae family. Its leaves are edible and have a tangy, sour flavor due to the presence of oxalic acid. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and woodland margins."
