    "intro": "Rosa canina f. pseudodiscolor, commonly known as the pale form of dog rose, is a botanical variant of the common dog rose. It is characterized by its pale pink to almost white flowers, which contrast with the typical red or pink blooms of the standard Rosa canina. The plant is a deciduous shrub with thorny stems and pinnate leaves, typical of the Rosaceae family. Its flowers are usually borne in clusters and have a sweet fragrance. This form is less common in cultivation but is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical significance in herbal medicine."
