It is characterized by its dense, tightly packed petals that resemble a cabbage head, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows as a shrub with thorny stems and dark green, leathery foliage. It produces fragrant, pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often used in perfumery and floral arrangements."
