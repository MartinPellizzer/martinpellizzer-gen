It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and delicate, yellowish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun conditions. It is notable for its small, bell-shaped blooms that appear in late summer to early autumn. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
