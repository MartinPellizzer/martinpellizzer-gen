    "intro": "Rhamnus betulifolia, commonly known as the paperbark alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that resembles birch, hence its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring, followed by dark blue berries that are an important food source for birds and wildlife. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and forest edges. Rhamnus betulifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in its native habitat."
