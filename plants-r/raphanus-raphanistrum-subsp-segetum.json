    "intro": "Raphanus raphanistrum subsp. segetum, commonly known as wild radish, is a member of the Brassicaceae family. It is an annual or biennial herb characterized by its upright stem and alternate leaves that are usually lobed or serrated. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which are followed by pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It is native to Europe and Asia but has been introduced to other regions, often growing in disturbed soils and agricultural fields. Its botanical features make it a common weed in cultivated areas."
