    "intro": "Riedelia grandiligula, commonly known as the grandiligulate riedelia, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the family Cactaceae, which includes cacti and related succulent plants. The plant is characterized by its spiny stems and clusters of small, tubular flowers that bloom in shades of yellow and orange. It thrives in arid environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
