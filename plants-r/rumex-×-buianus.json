    "intro": "Rumex \u00d7 buianus, commonly known as the hybrid sorrel, is a cross between Rumex acetosa (common sorrel) and Rumex acetobipinatus (broad-leaved sorrel). It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its reddish stems and heart-shaped leaves with a serrated margin. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, and its leaves contain high levels of oxalic acid, which gives them a tart, sour taste. It thrives in moist, fertile soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits variability in morphology and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
