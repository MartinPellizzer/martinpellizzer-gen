    "intro": "Rosa canina var. glandulosociliata, commonly known as the glandular-fruited dog rose, is a variant of the dog rose species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it its scientific name. The flowers are typically pink to red, with five petals and numerous stamens, and they bloom in the spring. The fruit, a red, hairy rose hip, matures in the autumn and is a source of vitamin C. This plant is often found in woodlands and along hedgebanks, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
