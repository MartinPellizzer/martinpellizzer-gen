    "intro": "Ranunculus divaricatus subsp. pseudocircinatus, commonly known as the alpine buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It features basal leaves that are deeply lobed and often hairy, with a short, stout stem that bears a single, showy yellow flower. The flower has five to seven petal-like sepals that are typically not fully petalous, giving it a distinctive, cup-like appearance. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in meadows and rocky slopes at high elevations. This subspecies is notable for its horticultural value and is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental flowers."
