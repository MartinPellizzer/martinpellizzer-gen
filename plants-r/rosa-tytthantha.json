It is a shrub-like plant characterized by its dense, thornless stems and clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers. The leaves are alternate, pinnately compound, and covered in fine, silky hairs that give the plant its common name. The flowers typically bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.
