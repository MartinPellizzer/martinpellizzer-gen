It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or orange in color. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as forest understories and stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
