    "intro": "Rapanea andina, commonly known as the Andean boxwood, is a slow-growing evergreen shrub native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, leathery leaves that are typically arranged in whorls. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, followed by dark blue or black berries. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests at high elevations. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
