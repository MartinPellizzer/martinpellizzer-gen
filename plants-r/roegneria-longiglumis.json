    "intro": "Roegneria longiglumis, commonly known as the slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, which are wind-pollinated. Roegneria longiglumis is often found in rocky or alpine habitats, where it forms dense mats that help prevent soil erosion. Its ecological importance lies in its ability to thrive in harsh environments and support local biodiversity."
