It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is native to regions of North America, particularly the eastern United States. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or yellow in color, similar to other raspberry species. Its foliage is often covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance.
