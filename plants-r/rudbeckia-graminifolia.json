    "intro": "Rudbeckia graminifolia, commonly known as the grassleaf coneflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the central and eastern United States. It features upright, slender stems that bear opposite, grass-like leaves that are narrow and lance-shaped. The plant produces showy, daisy-like yellow-orange flower heads in late summer to early fall. Its composite flowers consist of a yellow disk surrounded by pale yellow to brown ray florets. Rudbeckia graminifolia is well-suited for moist to wet soils and thrives in full sun, making it a valuable addition to wetland gardens."
