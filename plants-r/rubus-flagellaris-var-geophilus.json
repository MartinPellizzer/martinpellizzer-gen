    "intro": "Rubus flagellaris var. geophilus, commonly known as the creeping blackberry, is a perennial shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with stems that root at the nodes and form dense mats. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers in the spring, followed by edible berries that ripen to a dark purple or black color. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated margins, and the plant is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
