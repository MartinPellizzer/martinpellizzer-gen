    "intro": "Rubus villicaulis subsp. umbrosus, commonly known as the shade raspberry, is a shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its biennial growth habit, with flowering occurring on the previous year's growth. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or black in color, which are edible but often tart. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, and is often found in association with other shade-tolerant flora. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated margins, and the stems are covered in fine, glandular hairs."
