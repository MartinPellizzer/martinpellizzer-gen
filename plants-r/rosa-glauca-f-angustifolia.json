    "intro": "Rosa glauca f. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leafed bluebush rose, is a compact, low-growing shrub with a dense, bushy habit. It features pale blue to lavender flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, giving the plant a distinctive, somewhat rugged appearance. It is native to the western United States and thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. This cultivar is valued for its hardiness and ornamental appeal in rock gardens and as a border plant."
