    "intro": "Rhus juglandifolia, commonly known as the winged sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and have a distinctive wing-like appearance on the leaflets. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by clusters of red, fuzzy fruits that persist into winter. Its bark is rough and fissured, and it often grows in moist, wooded areas. Rhus juglandifolia is valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
