    "intro": "Rottboellia divergens, commonly known as the African grass or false brome, is a perennial grass species native to Africa, Asia, and the Americas. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy along the edges. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Rottboellia divergens is adapted to a wide range of environmental conditions, including drought and poor soil, making it an invasive species in some regions. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes contribute to its ecological impact."
