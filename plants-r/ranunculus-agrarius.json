    "intro": "Ranunculus agrarius, commonly known as the lesser celandine, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a basal rosette of smooth, heart-shaped leaves and produces early spring blooms of bright yellow, cup-shaped flowers. The plant is characterized by its milky sap, which can cause skin irritation in some individuals. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Ranunculus agrarius is often found growing in clusters, and its rapid growth makes it both a useful ground cover and a potential invasive species in certain regions."
