    "intro": "Rubus heterophyllus, commonly known as the variable bramble, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea, and thrives in temperate climates. The plant is characterized by its variable leaf morphology, with some leaves being simple and others compound, which gives it its scientific name. It produces small, white or pink flowers that are followed by red or black berries. The plant is often found in woodland areas and along stream banks, where it can form dense thickets."
