    "intro": "Rubus dimorphus, commonly known as the trailing blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the western United States. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and thorny stems, which help it to spread along the ground. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black in color. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three leaflets that are hairy on the underside. Rubus dimorphus is often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and streambanks."
