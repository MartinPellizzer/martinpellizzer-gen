    "intro": "Rhus africana, commonly known as the African sumac, is a small to medium-sized deciduous shrub or tree native to southern Africa. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, fuzzy fruits that are a key feature of the species. Its leaves are compound, with three to five leaflets, and the plant is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Rhus africana is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has traditional uses in some indigenous communities."
