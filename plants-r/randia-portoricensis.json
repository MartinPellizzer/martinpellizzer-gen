    "intro": "Randia portoricensis, commonly known as the Puerto Rican randia, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean island of Puerto Rico. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that are often followed by orange-red berries. Randia portoricensis typically grows in moist, shaded areas such as forest understories and is often found in lowland and montane regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
