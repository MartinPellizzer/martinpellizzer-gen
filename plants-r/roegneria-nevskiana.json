    "intro": "Roegneria nevskiana, commonly known as the Nevska's wheatgrass, is a species of grass native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous florets, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Roegneria nevskiana is often found in alpine meadows and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in its native habitat."
