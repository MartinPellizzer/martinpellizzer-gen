    "intro": "Rosa arvensis subsp. repens, commonly known as creeping woodsrose, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features slender, trailing stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces fragrant, pink to red flowers in summer, which are typically borne on pedicels. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three oval to elliptical leaflets, and the plant is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its tolerance to partial shade."
