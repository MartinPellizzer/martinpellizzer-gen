    "intro": "Ranunculus borealis, commonly known as the Arctic buttercup, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic regions of North America and Eurasia. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, tundra or alpine habitats. The plant features small, yellowish flowers with five petals and numerous stamens, typical of the Ranunculaceae family. Its leaves are palmately lobed and often covered in fine hairs to protect against cold temperatures. Ranunculus borealis plays a role in pollination by attracting insects such as bees and flies in its short growing season."
