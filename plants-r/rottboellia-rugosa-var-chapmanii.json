    "intro": "Rottboellia rugosa var. chapmanii, commonly known as Chapman's carpet grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features tufted,\u4e1b\u751f\u7684 growth with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread readily, making it both a pioneer species and a potential weed in certain environments."
