    "intro": "Rumex lentatus, commonly known as the broad-leaved dock, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, greenish flowers in dense clusters. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are edible and have been used historically in traditional medicine. The species is also known for its ability to accumulate heavy metals, making it useful in phytoremediation efforts."
