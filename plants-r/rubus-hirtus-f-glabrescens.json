    "intro": "Rubus hirtus f. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant characterized by its smoother, less hairy foliage compared to the typical Rubus hirtus. It is a shrub native to North America, particularly found in the eastern United States. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically smaller than those of other blackberry species. Its leaves are alternate, palmately lobed, and often have a slightly serrated margin. The flowers are white and clustered in umbels, typical of the Rubus genus."
