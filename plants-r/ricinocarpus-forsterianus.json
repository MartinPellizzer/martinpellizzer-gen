    "intro": "Ricinocarpus forsterianus, commonly known as the New Zealand tree fern, is a tall, evergreen tree fern native to New Zealand. It has a slender, unbranched trunk that is covered in a layer of fibrous, spongy material called the rachis. The plant produces large, feather-like fronds that can grow up to 3 meters in length, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in coastal areas and forests. The species is known for its slow growth and long lifespan, with some individuals living over 100 years."
