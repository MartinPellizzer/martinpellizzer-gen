    "intro": "Rhaphidophora pteropoda, commonly known as the Zebra Plant, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, waxy, dark green leaves with prominent white veins that create a zebra-like pattern. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters and produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by red berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil. Rhaphidophora pteropoda is valued for its ornamental foliage and is often cultivated as a houseplant."
