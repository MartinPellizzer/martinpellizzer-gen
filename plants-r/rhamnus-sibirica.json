It is characterized by its upright growth habit and small, oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, dark blue berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in forest edges and open woodlands. Rhamnus sibirica is also valued for its ornamental appeal and hardy nature in temperate regions."
