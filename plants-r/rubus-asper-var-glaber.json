    "intro": "Rubus asper var. glaber, commonly known as the smooth bramble, is a variant of the bramble species characterized by its smooth, less hairy stems and leaves compared to other Rubus species. It is a shrub native to parts of Europe and Asia, typically found in woodlands and hedgerows. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits known as berries, which are often red or black in color. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, and they bloom in early summer. The leaves are simple, alternate, and have a serrated margin, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
