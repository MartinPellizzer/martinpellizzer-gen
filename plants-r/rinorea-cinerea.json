It is characterized by its soft, silvery-gray foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences. Rinorea cinerea is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests or along stream banks. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
