    "intro": "Rosa ardala subsp. contraprolongata, commonly known as the elongated rose, is a rare and lesser-known subspecies of the rose genus. It is characterized by its distinctive elongated petals and dense, thorny stems. Native to the mountainous regions of southern China, it thrives in cool, humid climates with well-drained soil. The plant produces fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white, typically blooming in late spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a botanical curiosity and is often sought after by horticulturists and botanists."
