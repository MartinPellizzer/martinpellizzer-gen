    "intro": "Rhus rogersii, commonly known as the Rogers' sumac, is a deciduous shrub native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically pinnate with 9 to 15 leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in upright clusters, followed by red, fuzzy berries that are a food source for birds and small mammals. Rhus rogersii thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to withstand drought conditions."
