    "intro": "Rhus somalensis, commonly known as the Somali buckthorn, is a shrub or small tree native to the Horn of Africa. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically pinnately arranged with serrated margins. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for birds and small mammals. It thrives in dry, arid environments and is often found in savanna and woodland ecosystems. Rhus somalensis is also valued for its hardy nature and ability to withstand drought conditions."
