    "intro": "Richella obanensis, commonly known as the Oban bellflower, is a rare and distinctive flowering plant native to the Scottish Highlands. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, pale blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils in shaded woodland areas. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are slender and often branched. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
