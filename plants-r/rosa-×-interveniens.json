    "intro": "Rosa \u00d7 interveniens, commonly known as the everglast rose, is a hybrid species within the rose family (Rosaceae). It is characterized by its evergreen foliage, which remains lush throughout the year, making it suitable for colder climates. The plant produces fragrant, semi-double flowers in shades of pink and white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It is a compact shrub that thrives in full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for gardeners seeking a low-maintenance, year-round flowering plant."
