    "intro": "Rubus hybridus, commonly known as the common blackberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the Americas. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves. The plant produces aggregate fruits, known as berries, which are typically dark purple to black in color. These berries are edible, though they have a tart flavor and are often used in jams and pies. Rubus hybridus thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland areas or along hedgerows."
