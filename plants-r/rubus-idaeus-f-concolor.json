    "intro": "Rubus idaeus f. concolor, commonly known as the smooth raspberry, is a variant of the red raspberry plant characterized by its smooth, less hairy stems and leaves. It is a deciduous shrub native to North America, typically found in moist, wooded areas. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are generally less flavorful and more acidic than the common raspberry. Its flowers are white and five-petaled, appearing in the spring before the leaves fully develop. The smooth raspberry is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
