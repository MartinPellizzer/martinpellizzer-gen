It is characterized by its slender stems and small, fragrant pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, serrated leaves and exhibits a unique growth habit adapted to its cold, mountainous environment. It is highly valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and floral fragrance. Due to its limited natural range and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
