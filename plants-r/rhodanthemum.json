    "intro": "Rhodanthemum, commonly known as the everlasting flower, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. These plants are native to southern Africa and are characterized by their daisy-like flowers with a central disk surrounded by ray florets. Rhodanthemum species are typically perennial, often growing in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. They produce small, tightly packed flower heads that are often used in floral arrangements due to their long-lasting nature. The botanical name reflects their ornamental value and the enduring beauty of their blooms."
