    "intro": "Rosa canina f. subrufa, commonly known as the red-fruited dog rose, is a botanical variant of the common dog rose. It is characterized by its distinctive red or orange-red hips, which contrast with the typical yellow or orange of the species. The plant produces fragrant pink to white flowers in early summer, followed by the development of its characteristic fruit. It is a deciduous shrub that thrives in temperate climates, often found in hedgerows and woodland edges. Its botanical features make it a valuable species for both ornamental gardening and ecological habitats."
