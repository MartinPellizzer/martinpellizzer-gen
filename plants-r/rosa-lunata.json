    "intro": "Rosa lunata, commonly known as the moon rose, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains in South America. It is characterized by its pale pink to white flowers, which bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant produces fragrant, semi-double flowers that are often described as resembling a crescent moon, hence its common name. Rosa lunata is a shrub that can grow up to 1.5 meters tall, with thorny stems and dark green, serrated leaves. It thrives in cool, humid climates and is valued for its ornamental beauty and historical use in traditional medicine."
