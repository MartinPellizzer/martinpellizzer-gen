    "intro": "Rauranita paludosa, commonly known as the marsh bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland environments in the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist to waterlogged soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant features slender, upright stems that bear clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white or pale blue. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Rauranita paludosa plays an important ecological role in wetland habitats by providing food and shelter for various insect and bird species."
