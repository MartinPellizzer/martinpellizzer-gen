    "intro": "Rachelia, commonly known as the \"flower of the desert,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. These plants are native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and Southwestern Asia. They are characterized by their showy, often brightly colored flowers that bloom in clusters. The leaves are typically palmately lobed, and the stems are often hairy or woolly, adaptations to conserve water in harsh environments. Rachelia species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
