    "intro": "Ranunculus tabescens, commonly known as the alpine buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It features delicate, yellow flowers with five petals and a hairy, upright stem. The plant has palmately divided leaves with a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its high-altitude habitat. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its short growing season, it blooms early in the spring before the summer heat arrives."
