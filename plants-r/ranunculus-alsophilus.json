    "intro": "Ranunculus alsophilus, commonly known as the Alsop's buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the western United States. It features delicate, spurred flowers in shades of yellow to orange, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are alternate and often covered in a waxy coating. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
