The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by red or orange berries that are edible for some wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as woodlands and grasslands. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local fauna."
