It typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 meters and has compound leaves composed of 5 to 9 pairs of oval, serrated leaflets. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in panicles during the spring, which are followed by reddish-brown, toxic berries in the fall. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine, and the plant is known for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types. Rhus asplenifolia is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native landscapes."
