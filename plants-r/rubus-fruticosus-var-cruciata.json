    "intro": "Rubus fruticosus var. cruciata, commonly known as the bramble or blackberry bush, is a shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves, which are typically serrated and have a rough texture. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by edible berries that ripen in late summer or early autumn. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, loamy soils and full sun to partial shade. This species is often used in hedgerows and for its ornamental and culinary value."
