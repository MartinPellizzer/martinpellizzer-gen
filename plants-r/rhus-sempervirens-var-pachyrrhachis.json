    "intro": "Rhus sempervirens var. pachyrrhachis, commonly known as the thick-leafed boxwood, is a compact, slow-growing shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage, with thick, leathery leaves that are typically a deep green color. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries that are attractive to birds. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to form dense, rounded forms. Its botanical features make it suitable for use as a hedge or topiary in gardens."
