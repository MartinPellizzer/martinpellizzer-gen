It features finely divided, palmately lobed leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of soft, white hairs. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
