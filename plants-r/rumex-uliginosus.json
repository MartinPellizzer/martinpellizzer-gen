    "intro": "Rumex uliginosus, commonly known as swamp sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often reddish at the base, and it produces small, greenish flowers in clusters. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. It has a distinctive sour taste due to the presence of oxalic acid in its leaves. Rumex uliginosus plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various insects and animals."
