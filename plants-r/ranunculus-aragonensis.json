    "intro": "Ranunculus aragonensis, commonly known as the Aragon water crowfoot, is a perennial aquatic plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in shallow freshwater habitats such as ponds, streams, and wet meadows. The plant has finely divided, floating leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to prevent water loss. Its flowers are usually bright yellow with numerous stamens, and they bloom from spring to early summer. Ranunculus aragonensis plays an important role in supporting aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and small fish."
