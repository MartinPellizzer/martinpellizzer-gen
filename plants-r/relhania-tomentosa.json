    "intro": "Relhania tomentosa, commonly known as the velvetleaf or woolly relhania, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its dense, soft, grayish-white pubescence that covers its stems and leaves, giving it a distinctive velvety appearance. The plant has simple, opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are often leathery in texture. It produces small, clustered yellowish-white flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Relhania tomentosa is often found in humid, shaded environments such as rainforests and is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant."
