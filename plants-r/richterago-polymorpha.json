    "intro": "Richterago polymorpha, commonly known as the common tansy, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its yellow flowers arranged in flat, circular heads, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are aromatic and emit a strong, camphor-like scent. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Despite its ornamental appeal, it contains toxic compounds and should be handled with care."
