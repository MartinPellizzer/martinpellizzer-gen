    "intro": "Restio cincinnatus, commonly known as the narrow restio, is a member of the Restionaceae family, native to South Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in coastal and sandy environments, often found in fynbos vegetation. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny white or pale blue flowers. It is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and can tolerate salt spray, making it well-suited to its coastal habitat. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is often used in ornamental gardening and conservation efforts."
