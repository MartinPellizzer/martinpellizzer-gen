    "intro": "Rosa canina var. effusa, commonly known as the common dog rose, is a shrub native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems, compound leaves, and fragrant pink or white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces red, hairy fruits called hips, which are rich in vitamin C and used in traditional medicine. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, sunny locations. Rosa canina var. effusa is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing food and habitat for wildlife."
