    "intro": "Rubus arvernensis, commonly known as the Arverne bramble, is a species of flowering plant in the rose family, Rosaceae. It is native to western Europe, particularly France and parts of Italy, where it thrives in moist, wooded areas. The plant is characterized by its thorny stems, trifoliate leaves, and small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or black in color. It plays a role in supporting local wildlife, including birds and insects, due to its nectar-rich flowers and fruit. However, it is considered a potential weed in some regions due to its vigorous growth and ability to spread readily."
