    "intro": "Rumex crystallinus, commonly known as the crystalline sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its succulent, ribbed stems and trifoliate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its rhubarb-like leaves are edible but contain oxalic acid, making them somewhat tart and potentially irritating if consumed in large quantities. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks."
