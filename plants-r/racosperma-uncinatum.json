It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant produces pods that contain seeds with hooked appendages, aiding in seed dispersal. It is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and ecologists."
