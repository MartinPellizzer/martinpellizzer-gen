    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 eremicola, commonly known as the desert raspberry, is a hybrid shrub native to arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, edible red berries. The plant thrives in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited water availability. Its leaves are typically trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it produces white to pinkish flowers in the spring. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in restoration projects in degraded landscapes."
