It features cylindrical stems that are typically greenish-gray in color, covered with small, spiny tubercles. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking contrast to its textured foliage. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
