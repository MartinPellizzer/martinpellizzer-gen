    "intro": "Royena ovalifolia, commonly known as the oval-leaf royal fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its striking, feather-like fronds. The plant features a short, creeping rhizome with dense, dark green, lanceolate leaves. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Royena ovalifolia is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable humid conditions."
