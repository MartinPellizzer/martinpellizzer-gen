    "intro": "Raphanus sativus var. oleifer, commonly known as the oil radish, is a biennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its robust, upright stem and large, lobed leaves that are hairy and covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces a single, thick, fleshy root that is typically dark purple or black in color. Its flowers are small and yellow, arranged in a dense cluster at the top of the plant. This variety is valued for its high oil content in the root, which is used in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils."
