    "intro": "Rosa nymanii, commonly known as the Nyman's rose, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Europe, particularly in areas with cool, moist climates. The plant is characterized by its upright growth habit, with simple, pinnate leaves and fragrant, pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Rosa nymanii is often found in woodlands and along stream banks, where it thrives in well-drained, loamy soils. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
