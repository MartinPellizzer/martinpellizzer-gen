    "intro": "Rheum forrestii, commonly known as the Tibetan rhubarb, is a perennial plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers during the summer months. Its rhubarb-like stems are edible, though they are typically not consumed due to their high oxalic acid content. Rheum forrestii is valued for its ornamental appeal and has traditional uses in herbal medicine."
