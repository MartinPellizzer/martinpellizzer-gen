    "intro": "Ravensara elliptica, commonly known as the broad-leafed raven's berry, is a small evergreen shrub native to the humid forests of eastern Australia. It is characterized by its elliptical, dark green leaves that are glossy and often have a slight waxy coating. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters, followed by bright red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. Ravensara elliptica thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers partial to full shade. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to provide habitat for native wildlife."
