    "intro": "Rhyncholacis crassipes, commonly known as the broad-leaved marsh orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States. It features a rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces showy, spike-like inflorescences with pale yellow to greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to thrive in waterlogged soils, while its rhizomes help it spread vegetatively. Rhyncholacis crassipes plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and nectar for pollinators."
