    "intro": "Rhododendron chamaecistus, commonly known as the dwarf rhododendron, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows to a height of about 30 centimeters, featuring dense, leathery leaves that are dark green and glossy. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or white during late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or woodland settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to form a neat, compact growth habit with minimal pruning."
