It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, edible berries that ripen in the summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in mountainous regions. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and its flowers are white with five petals. It plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing food for wildlife and stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
