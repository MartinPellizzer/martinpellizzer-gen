    "intro": "Rhus venenata, commonly known as poison ivy, is a deciduous shrub native to North America. It is characterized by its alternate, trifoliate leaves that are typically reddish in color when new and turn green as they mature. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, followed by red, fuzzy fruits that contain three seeds. It is known for its toxic sap, which can cause severe skin irritation in humans. Rhus venenata thrives in a variety of habitats, including woodlands, fields, and along roadsides."
