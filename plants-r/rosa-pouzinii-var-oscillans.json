    "intro": "Rosa pouzinii var. oscillans, commonly known as the oscillating rose, is a rare and unique variation of the Rosa pouzinii species. It is characterized by its pendulous, drooping flowers that sway with the breeze, giving it its common name. The plant is native to the mountainous regions of southern China, where it thrives in cool, shaded environments. Its foliage consists of dark green, serrated leaves, and it produces fragrant, pinkish-white blooms. Due to its limited distribution and delicate nature, it is considered a botanical curiosity and is often cultivated in specialized gardens."
