    "intro": "Rumex pulcher var. macrodon, commonly known as the large-leaf dock, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers that are borne on tall, erect stems. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks. The leaves and stems are sometimes used in traditional medicine for their astringent properties."
