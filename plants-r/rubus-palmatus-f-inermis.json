It is characterized by its smooth, unarmed stems, distinguishing it from other Rubus species that typically have thorns. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or yellow in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. This form is valued for its ornamental appeal and mild-flavored berries."
