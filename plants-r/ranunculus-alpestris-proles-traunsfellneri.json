    "intro": "Ranunculus alpestris proles traunsfellneri, commonly known as the Traunfellner's alpine buttercup, is a rare and specialized plant species native to high alpine regions. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, yellow flowers with five petals. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at elevations above 2,000 meters. It has small, palmately divided leaves and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
