    "intro": "Ricinocarpus virgatus, commonly known as the coastal mangrove or sea hibiscus, is a flowering plant species native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia and Australia. It is a small, shrub-like tree that thrives in saline and brackish water environments, often found in mangrove ecosystems. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are often covered in a waxy layer to reduce water loss. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Ricinocarpus virgatus plays an important role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species."
