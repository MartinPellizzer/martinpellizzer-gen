    "intro": "Rhytidocaulon tortum, commonly known as the twisted root orchid, is a unique epiphytic plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its fibrous, twisted roots that give it its common name and help it anchor to tree bark in its natural habitat. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are often clustered in a raceme, typical of many orchid species. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, usually found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
