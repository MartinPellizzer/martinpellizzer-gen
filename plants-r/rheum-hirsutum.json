    "intro": "Rheum hirsutum, commonly known as the woolly rhubarb, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of soft, woolly hairs. The plant produces tall, sparsely branched stems that bear clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers. Its rhubarb-like appearance has led to its common name, though it is not typically cultivated for its edible stalks. Rheum hirsutum is often found in rocky or arid environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
