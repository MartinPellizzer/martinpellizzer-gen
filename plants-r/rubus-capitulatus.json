It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and thorny stems, typical of the Rubus genus. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible and often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in alpine and subalpine environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies in high-altitude ecosystems."
