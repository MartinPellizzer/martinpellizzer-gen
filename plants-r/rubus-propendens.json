    "intro": "Rubus propendens, commonly known as the leaning blackberry, is a species of bramble native to parts of Asia, particularly China. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and produces small, dark berries that are typically consumed by birds and other wildlife. The plant has compound leaves with three to five leaflets, and its flowers are usually white or pale pink. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
