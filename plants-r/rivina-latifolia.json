    "intro": "Rivina latifolia, commonly known as broadleaf rivina, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 feet, featuring slender, woody stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are usually pink or red, which bloom in the spring and summer. These flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, making it a valuable addition to native gardens. Its adaptability to various soil types and full sun to partial shade conditions makes it a versatile ornamental plant."
