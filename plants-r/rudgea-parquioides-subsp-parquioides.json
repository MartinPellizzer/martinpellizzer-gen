The plant is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. It typically grows as an upright shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is of significant interest in botanical research and conservation efforts."
