    "intro": "Rhinanthus rusticulus, commonly known as the common tickseed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It is an annual herb that typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as grasslands and waste areas. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that are clustered in spikes, and it is often found in the British Isles and parts of Europe. Rhinanthus rusticulus is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients. Its presence is often an indicator of healthy, well-drained soils in grassland ecosystems."
