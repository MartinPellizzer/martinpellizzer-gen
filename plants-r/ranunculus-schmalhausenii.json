    "intro": "Ranunculus schmalhausenii, commonly known as the Schmalhausen's buttercup, is a flowering plant native to Central Asia. It is a member of the Ranunculaceae family, characterized by its showy, often yellow or white petals. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are palmately divided, and it produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
