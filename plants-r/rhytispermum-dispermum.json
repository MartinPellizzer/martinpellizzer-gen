    "intro": "Rhytispermum dispermum, commonly known as the two-seeded rhytispermum, is a rare and lesser-known flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the family Rutaceae, which includes plants like citrus and rue, and is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers. The plant produces two seeds per fruit, a trait that gives it its scientific name. Its leaves are typically narrow and have a distinctive aromatic scent, while its flowers are often clustered in inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
