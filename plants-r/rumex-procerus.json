It features upright, ribbed stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, often with a reddish tinge. The plant has alternate, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, greenish flowers in clusters during the spring. Its roots are fibrous and can be harvested for use in traditional medicine. Rumex procerus is adapted to moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks."
