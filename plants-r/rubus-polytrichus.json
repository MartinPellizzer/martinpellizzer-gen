    "intro": "Rubus polytrichus, commonly known as the prickly raspberry, is a species of bramble native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, red, edible berries. The plant typically grows in woodland edges, hedgerows, and other moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are compound, with three to five leaflets, and its flowers are white or pale pink. The fruit is often used in jams and desserts, though it is less common than other raspberry varieties."
