    "intro": "Rumex papillaris, commonly known as the hairy dock, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. The plant has rough, ribbed leaves with prominent veins and a distinctive hairy texture. Its flowers are small and clustered in dense, erect spikes, often appearing in late spring to early summer. Rumex papillaris is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
