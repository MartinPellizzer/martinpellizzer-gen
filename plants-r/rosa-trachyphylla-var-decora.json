    "intro": "Rosa trachyphylla var. decora, commonly known as the Decorate Rosa, is a variant of the rough rose, native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and clusters of small, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring. The foliage is typically dark green with a slightly hairy texture, contributing to its rugged appearance. This plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a hardy ornamental shrub. Its botanical features make it a resilient and visually interesting addition to botanical collections."
