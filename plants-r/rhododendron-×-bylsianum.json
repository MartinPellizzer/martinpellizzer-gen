    "intro": "Rhododendron \u00d7 bylsianum, commonly known as the Bylsma rhododendron, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Rhododendron caucasicum and Rhododendron molle. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of red, pink, and white. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is further enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
