    "intro": "Rumex brownianus, commonly known as Brownian sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of North America. It features heart-shaped leaves with a reddish stem, and its foliage is often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are edible but contain oxalic acid, so they should be consumed in moderation."
