    "intro": "Rubus rubroangustifolius, commonly known as the red narrow-leaf blackberry, is a species of brambles native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dark red stems, trifoliate leaves with narrow, pointed lobes, and small, aggregate fruits that ripen to a deep black color. The plant produces fragrant white flowers in the spring, which are pollinated by insects. It thrives in moist, wooded areas and is often found in the understory of forests, where it spreads through both runners and upright canes. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and natural landscapes."
