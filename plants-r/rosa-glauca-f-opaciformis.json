    "intro": "Rosa glauca f. opaciformis, commonly known as the opaciform rose, is a botanical variant of the blue rose. It is characterized by its distinctive, opaque, bluish-pink petals that differ from the typical translucent pink of the parent species. This form is a fasciation variant, meaning it exhibits flattened, ribbon-like growth patterns in its floral structure. The plant is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and is prized for its unique coloration and ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth."
