It features delicate, yellow flowers with five petals and a hairy, upright stem. The leaves are trifoliate, with three lobed segments, and are typically covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. This variant is distinguished by its longer, more slender stem compared to the typical form of Ranunculus flammula."
