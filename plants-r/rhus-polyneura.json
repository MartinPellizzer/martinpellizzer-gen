    "intro": "Rhus polyneura, commonly known as the narrowleaf sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are composed of several narrow, elongated leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clustered inflorescences, followed by red, fuzzy fruits that are a common food source for birds. Rhus polyneura thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in swamps, stream banks, and wetlands. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
