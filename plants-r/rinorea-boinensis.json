    "intro": "Rinorea boinensis, commonly known as the Bornean rinorea, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia, particularly Borneo. It is a small shrub that typically grows in tropical rainforests, often in shaded, moist environments. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a rough texture, while its stems are woody and somewhat branched. Rinorea boinensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique floral display."
