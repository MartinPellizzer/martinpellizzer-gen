It is characterized by its large, edible fruits, which are often referred to as \"rose hips.\" The plant typically grows in alpine regions, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its flowers are usually pink or white, and it produces a distinctive, woolly foliage. This subspecies is of particular interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and ecological adaptations."
