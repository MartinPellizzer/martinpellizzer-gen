    "intro": "Ranunculus napahaiensis, commonly known as the Napahai buttercup, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in Peru. It is characterized by its bright yellow or orange petals and a central cluster of small, green sepals, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky soils and is adapted to the cool, temperate climate of its native habitat. Its flowers bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ranunculus napahaiensis is considered a vulnerable species."
