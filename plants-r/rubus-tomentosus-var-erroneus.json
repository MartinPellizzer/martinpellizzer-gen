    "intro": "Rubus tomentosus var. erroneus, commonly known as the woolly blackberry variant, is a species of bramble native to North America. It is characterized by its dense, grayish-white pubescence covering its stems and leaves, giving it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black when mature. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Due to its morphological similarities with other Rubus species, it is often misidentified, leading to its name \"erroneus.\""
