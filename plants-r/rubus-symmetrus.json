    "intro": "Rubus symmetrus, commonly known as the symmetrical blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with five leaflets that are symmetrically arranged. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that mature to a dark purple or black color, similar to other blackberry species. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and hedgerows. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and agricultural settings."
