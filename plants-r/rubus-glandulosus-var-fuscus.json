    "intro": "Rubus glandulosus var. fuscus, commonly known as the blackberry bramble, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to North America. It is characterized by its thorny stems and trifoliate leaves, which are typically covered in fine, glandular hairs. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that ripen to a dark purple or black color, often with a sweet-tart flavor. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, loamy conditions. This species is often found in woodland edges, thickets, and disturbed areas, contributing to local biodiversity."
