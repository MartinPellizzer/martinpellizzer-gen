    "intro": "Retrophyllum piresii, commonly known as the Pires' retrophyllum, is a rare flowering plant native to the subtropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its unique, spirally arranged leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
