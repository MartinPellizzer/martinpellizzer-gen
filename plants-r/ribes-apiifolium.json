    "intro": "Ribes apiifolium, commonly known as the American gooseberry, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It features compound leaves with three to five leaflets, resembling the leaves of the carrot plant, hence its scientific name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by edible berries that ripen in late summer. These berries are often used in jams and preserves due to their tart flavor. Ribes apiifolium thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands and along streambanks."
