    "intro": "Ranunculus pskemensis, commonly known as the Pskem Valley buttercup, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family, characterized by its showy, often yellow or white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky soils and is found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Its leaves are palmately lobed, and the flowers consist of several sepals and petals that are often similar in appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
