    "intro": "Racosperma nesophilum, commonly known as the mountain acacia, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of eastern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, wiry stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers that appear in compact inflorescences. The plant produces flat, elliptical pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cool, moist environments. Racosperma nesophilum plays an important role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and provides habitat for various insect species."
