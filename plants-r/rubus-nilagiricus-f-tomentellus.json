    "intro": "Rubus nilagiricus f. tomentellus, commonly known as the Nilagiri raspberry, is a variant of the Rubus genus native to the Nilgiri Mountains in southern India. It is characterized by its dense, white tomentose (fuzzy) pubescence covering its stems and leaves. The plant produces small, red, aggregate fruits that are typically consumed fresh or used in local culinary practices. It thrives in temperate climates with high humidity and well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
