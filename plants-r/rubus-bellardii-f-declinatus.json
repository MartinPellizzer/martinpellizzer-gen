    "intro": "Rubus bellardii f. declinatus, commonly known as the lowbush raspberry. This plant is a rare and relict form of the lowbush raspberry, characterized by its compact growth habit and smaller, more delicate leaves compared to the typical species. It is native to specific regions in North America, particularly in the southeastern United States, where it thrives in moist, shaded woodland habitats. The flowers are usually white or pale pink, and the fruit is a small, tart red berry. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a genetic variant that provides insights into the evolutionary history of the Rubus genus."
