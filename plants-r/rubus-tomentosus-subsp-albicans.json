    "intro": "Rubus tomentosus subsp. albicans, commonly known as the white-haired raspberry, is a species of bramble native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its white-tomentose (fuzzy) underside on the leaves and stems, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or orange in color. It thrives in woodland edges and disturbed soils, often forming dense thickets. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and ecologically important member of the Rosaceae family."
