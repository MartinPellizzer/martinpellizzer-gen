    "intro": "Rhizophora corniculata, commonly known as the mangrove apple or red mangrove, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rhizophoraceae. It is characterized by its distinctive prop roots that help stabilize it in tidal environments. The plant thrives in saline and brackish water conditions, making it an essential component of coastal ecosystems. Its small, red, fleshy fruits are adapted for dispersal by water and animals. Rhizophora corniculata plays a crucial role in protecting shorelines and supporting marine and terrestrial biodiversity."
