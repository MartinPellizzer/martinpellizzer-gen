    "intro": "Rosa tomentella subvar. sinuatidens, commonly known as the woolly rose, is a shrub-like plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly gray foliage and thorny stems, which provide structural support and protection. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a slightly serrated margin, and are covered in a fine, fuzzy layer of hair. Rosa tomentella subvar. sinuatidens is well adapted to harsh, arid environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats."
