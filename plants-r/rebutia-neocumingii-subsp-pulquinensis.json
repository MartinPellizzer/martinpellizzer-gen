    "intro": "Rebutia neocumingii subsp. pulquinensis, commonly known as the Pulquinensis Rebutia, is a compact, spineless cactus native to Chile. It features short, cylindrical stems that are typically green to reddish in color, often adorned with white or yellow tubercles. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of yellow, orange, or red during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its slow growth and ornamental appeal, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and containers."
