    "intro": "Richardsonia scabra, commonly known as the rough-stemmed bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its hairy, rough-textured stems and leaves, which are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Richardsonia scabra thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. It is relatively rare and is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological niche."
