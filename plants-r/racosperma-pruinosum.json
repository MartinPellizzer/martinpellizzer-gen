    "intro": "Racosperma pruinosum, commonly known as the glossy acacia, is a shrub native to Australia. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and slender, wiry stems covered in a waxy, glossy coating. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in spherical inflorescences, which attract various pollinators. Its leaves are alternate and pinnately compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets. Racosperma pruinosum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
