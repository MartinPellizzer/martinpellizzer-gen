    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 vestifer, commonly known as the blackberry bramble, is a hybrid plant belonging to the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its thorny stems and aggregate fruits, which are typically dark purple to black in color. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by the development of its edible berries. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodlands and along the edges of cultivated fields. Due to its vigorous growth, it can become invasive in certain regions if not managed properly."
