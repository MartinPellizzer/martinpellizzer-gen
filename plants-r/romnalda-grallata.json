    "intro": "Romnalda grallata, commonly known as the featherleaf orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, pale pink or white flowers. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests or alpine meadows. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and climate change, Romnalda grallata is considered endangered in its natural range."
