    "intro": "Rumex mexicanus var. angustifolius, commonly known as Mexican sorrel, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It features erect, slender stems and alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are typically reddish or purple-tinged on the underside. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are edible and have a tangy, sour flavor due to the presence of oxalic acid. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or shaded areas."
