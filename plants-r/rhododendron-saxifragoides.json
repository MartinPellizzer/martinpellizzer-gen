    "intro": "Rhododendron saxifragoides, commonly known as the alpine rhododendron, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It typically grows in rocky and well-drained soils, often in alpine or subalpine habitats. The plant produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, which bloom in early to mid-spring. Its leaves are leathery and elliptical, providing dense foliage that helps protect the plant from harsh weather conditions. Rhododendron saxifragoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in challenging environments."
