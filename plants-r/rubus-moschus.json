    "intro": "Rubus moschus, commonly known as the musk rose, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is native to parts of Europe and Asia, particularly in regions with temperate climates. The plant is characterized by its thorny stems, trifoliate leaves, and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in early summer. Its fruit, a red, edible berry, is often used in culinary and medicinal applications. The plant's aromatic properties are largely derived from its flowers and leaves, which contain essential oils."
