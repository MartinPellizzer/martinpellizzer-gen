It is characterized by its finely hairy, silvery-gray leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, dark red berries that are typically eaten by birds and other wildlife. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and thickets. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its attractive foliage and persistent fruiting structures."
