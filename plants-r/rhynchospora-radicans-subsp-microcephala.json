    "intro": "Rhynchospora radicans subsp. microcephala, commonly known as the small-headed marsh sedge, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers that typically bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its subspecific name, *microcephala*, refers to its small, rounded flower heads. This species plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and birds."
