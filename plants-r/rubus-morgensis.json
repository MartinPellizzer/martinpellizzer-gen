    "intro": "Rubus morgensis, commonly known as the Morgensen blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its thorny stems, trifoliate leaves, and dark purple to black berries that ripen in late summer. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas or along stream banks. Its flowers are white or pale pink and are typically clustered in the axils of the leaves. The fruit is valued for its intense flavor and is used both in culinary applications and traditional medicine."
