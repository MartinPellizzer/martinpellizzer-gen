    "intro": "Ruellia gemmipara, commonly known as the gemmed ruellia, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its erect, herbaceous stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically blue or purple in color. Ruellia gemmipara is known for its ability to propagate through vegetative means, including gemmae, which are small plantlets that can develop into new plants. This feature makes it a popular choice for gardeners seeking easy propagation and dense foliage."
