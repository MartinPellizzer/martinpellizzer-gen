    "intro": "Rubus hirtus var. serpens, commonly known as the hairy blackberry vine, is a perennial shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and thorny stems, which help it climb and spread across vegetation. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically edible, though they are often described as having a tart flavor. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges and a hairy texture, contributing to its common name. The species is often found in wetland habitats, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils."
