    "intro": "Rhodamnia spongiosa, commonly known as the sponge tree, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the family Myrtaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, spongy bark that peels away in thin layers. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the spring and summer seasons. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a rough, textured surface, while its branches are often twisted and gnarled. Rhodamnia spongiosa is well adapted to dry, coastal environments and is often found in heathlands and open forests."
