    "intro": "Rosa aciphylla, commonly known as the thornless rock rose, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and is often found growing in rocky or arid environments. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, and it has no true thorns, which distinguishes it from other rose species. Rosa aciphylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to harsh conditions."
