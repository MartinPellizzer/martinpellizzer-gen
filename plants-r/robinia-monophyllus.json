    "intro": "Robinia monophyllus, commonly known as the yellow\u69d0 or false acacia, is a deciduous leguminous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically bipinnate and can reach up to 30 cm in length. The tree produces fragrant, yellowish-white flowers in cylindrical racemes during the spring. Its pods are long, slender, and contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. The plant has a deep root system and is often used in reforestation and soil stabilization due to its nitrogen-fixing capabilities."
