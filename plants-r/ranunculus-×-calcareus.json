    "intro": "Ranunculus \u00d7 calcareus, commonly known as the limestone buttercup, is a hybrid plant species that exhibits characteristics of both its parent species, Ranunculus ficaria and Ranunculus bulbosus. It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically thrives in calcareous soils, often found in rocky or limestone-rich environments. The plant features showy, bright yellow flowers with five to eight petals, and it produces small, round, greenish-brown seeds in a fluffy cluster. Ranunculus \u00d7 calcareus is known for its adaptability to marginal habitats and its ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative means. Its botanical significance lies in its role as an indicator species for calcareous soils and its ecological importance in supporting pollinators."
