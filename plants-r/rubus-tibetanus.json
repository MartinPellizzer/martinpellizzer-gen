It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, edible berries. The plant thrives in cold, mountainous environments with well-drained soil and full sun exposure. Its leaves are typically trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the flowers are pink or white, appearing in early summer. The berries, which ripen in late summer, are rich in antioxidants and have been used in traditional medicine and local cuisines."
