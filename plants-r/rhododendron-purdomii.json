    "intro": "Rhododendron purdomii, commonly known as the Purdom's rhododendron, is a rare and distinctive species native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and clusters of bell-shaped, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils and thrives in shaded, cool environments. Its ornamental value has made it a sought-after specimen in botanical gardens and specialized horticulture. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered an endangered species requiring conservation efforts."
