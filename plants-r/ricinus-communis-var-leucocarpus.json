    "intro": "Ricinus communis var. leucocarpus, commonly known as the white-seed castor, is a variant of the castor oil plant native to tropical regions. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves and unique white or pale-colored seeds, distinguishing it from the typical black seeds of the common castor. The plant produces showy, reddish-purple flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It is cultivated for its ornamental value and has limited use in oil production due to the reduced oil content in its seeds. This variety is also valued in traditional medicine for its potential therapeutic properties."
