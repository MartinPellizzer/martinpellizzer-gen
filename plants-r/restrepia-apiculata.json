    "intro": "Restrepia apiculata, commonly known as the apiculate bromeliad, is a flowering plant native to the cloud forests of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces striking inflorescences with bright red bracts that surround small, delicate white flowers. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Restrepia apiculata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
