    "intro": "Rostellularia adscendens subsp. glaucoviolacea, commonly known as the violet-leaved rostellularia, is a member of the Rubiaceae family. It is a shrub characterized by its glaucous, often violet-tinted leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, clustered flowers with white or pale pink petals, typically arranged in inflorescences. It is native to parts of Southeast Asia, including Thailand and Vietnam, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it remains relatively rare in horticultural trade."
