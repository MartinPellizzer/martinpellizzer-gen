    "intro": "Rosa \u00d7 dumetorum f. decebali, commonly known as the Decembric rose, is a compact shrub native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and small, dark green leaves. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring, typically around December, hence its common name. Its flowers are often followed by red or orange hips, which are edible and used in culinary applications. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and hardiness in cooler climates."
