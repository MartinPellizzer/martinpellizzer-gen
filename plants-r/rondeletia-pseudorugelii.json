It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to red. The plant typically grows as an upright shrub, reaching heights of up to 2 meters, with lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is adapted to well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for garden cultivation.
