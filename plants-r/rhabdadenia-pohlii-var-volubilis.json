    "intro": "Rhabdadenia pohlii var. volubilis, commonly known as the climbing rhabdadenia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Apocynaceae. It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, and is characterized by its trailing or climbing habit. The plant features opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often pubescent, and it produces clusters of small, tubular, yellowish-green flowers. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to full sun to partial shade conditions. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely commercially available."
