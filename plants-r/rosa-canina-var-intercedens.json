    "intro": "Rosa canina var. intercedens, commonly known as the dog rose variant intercedens, is a lesser-known subspecies of the dog rose. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers. The plant produces red, hairy fruits called hips, which are rich in vitamin C. It typically grows in open woodlands and scrublands, preferring well-drained soils. This variety is less commonly cultivated than other Rosa canina forms but is valued for its ornamental and medicinal properties."
