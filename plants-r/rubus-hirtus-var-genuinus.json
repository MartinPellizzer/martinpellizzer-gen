    "intro": "Rubus hirtus var. genuinus, commonly known as the rough blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to parts of North America. It is characterized by its prickly stems and leaves, which are covered in fine, stiff hairs. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically tart and less sweet than other blackberry varieties. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or thicket habitats. This variant is valued for its hardiness and ability to grow in a variety of environmental conditions."
