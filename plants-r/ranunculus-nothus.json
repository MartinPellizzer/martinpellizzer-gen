    "intro": "Ranunculus nothus, commonly known as the alpine buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky habitats, thriving in cool, moist environments. The plant features basal leaves that are palmately lobed, with bright yellow flowers that have numerous petal-like sepals. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it is often found in high-altitude areas where it contributes to the biodiversity of alpine ecosystems. Ranunculus nothus is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in mountainous habitats."
