It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black in color. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland or scrubland habitats. The subspecies is notable for its relatively smooth, less hairy fruit surface compared to other Rubus species."
