    "intro": "Rosa tomentosa var. pseudocuspidata, commonly known as the woolly rose or the fuzzy rose, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, white to grayish pubescence covering the stems, leaves, and flower buds, giving it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets with a hairy texture. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and hardy nature in cooler climates."
