It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, fens, and along the edges of ponds. Rhynchospora stenocarpa plays a vital role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
