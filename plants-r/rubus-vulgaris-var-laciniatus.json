    "intro": "Rubus vulgaris var. laciniatus, commonly known as the cut-leaved blackberry, is a variant of the common bramble. It is characterized by its finely serrated, lobed leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black when ripe. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in woodland edges and hedgerows. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for both ornamental and hedging purposes."
