    "intro": "Rhododendron irroratum subsp. kontumense, commonly known as the Kontum rhododendron, is a rare evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Vietnam. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows at high elevations, where it thrives in cool, moist, and shaded environments. Its flowers, which range in color from pink to red, bloom in late spring to early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
