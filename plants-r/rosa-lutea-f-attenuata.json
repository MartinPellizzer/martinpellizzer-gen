    "intro": "Rosa lutea f. attenuata, commonly known as the yellow rose with attenuated form, is a botanical variant of the species Rosa lutea. It is characterized by its pale yellow flowers and elongated, slender petals that give it a more delicate appearance compared to the standard form. The plant typically grows as a shrub with thorny stems and dark green, serrated leaves. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. This cultivar is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often used in gardens for its soft, pastel-colored blooms."
