    "intro": "Rourea coccinea, commonly known as the red-veined or bloodleaf plant, is a species of flowering plant in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its striking red veins on dark green leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, often hidden among the foliage. Rourea coccinea is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in warm, humid environments. It prefers partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardens."
