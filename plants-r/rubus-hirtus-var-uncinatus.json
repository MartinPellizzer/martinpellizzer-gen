    "intro": "Rubus hirtus var. uncinatus, commonly known as the hooked bramble, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of white to pale pink flowers. The leaves are typically trifoliate, with serrated margins, and the plant produces small, aggregate fruits known as berries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. This variant is distinguished by its hooked thorns, which are more pronounced than in other Rubus species."
