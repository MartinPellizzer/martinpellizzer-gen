    "intro": "Ranunculus tappeineri, commonly known as the Tappeiner's buttercup, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a short, stout rhizome and produces delicate, showy flowers with five to eight petal-like sepals. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky habitats, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a hairy surface that helps reduce water loss. The flowers are usually yellow or orange, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
