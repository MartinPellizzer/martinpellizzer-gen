It belongs to the family Rutaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in the spring, followed by dark purple berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. Its bark is typically smooth and grayish, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils in woodland areas."
