    "intro": "Rondeletia vazquezii, commonly known as the Vazquezii rondeletia, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows as an evergreen shrub, reaching heights of up to 2 meters, with opposite, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers, which bloom in clusters, are usually bright red or orange, attracting pollinators like hummingbirds and bees. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in tropical gardens, though it prefers moist, well-drained soils and partial shade."
