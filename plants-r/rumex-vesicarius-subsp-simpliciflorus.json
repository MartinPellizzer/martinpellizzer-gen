    "intro": "Rumex vesicarius subsp. simpliciflorus, commonly known as the simple-flowered dock, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along riverbanks. The plant features large, heart-shaped leaves with a waxy surface, and it produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in the summer. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their astringent properties. The subspecies simpliciflorus is distinguished by its simpler flower structure compared to other subspecies of Rumex vesicarius."
