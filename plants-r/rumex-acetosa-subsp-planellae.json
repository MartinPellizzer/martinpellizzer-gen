    "intro": "Rumex acetosa subsp. planellae, commonly known as narrowleaf sorrel, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks. The plant features slender, upright stems and trifoliate leaves with a distinctive sour taste due to its high oxalic acid content. Its small, greenish-white flowers are arranged in dense clusters and bloom in early summer. The subspecies is characterized by its narrower leaves compared to the typical R. acetosa, which contributes to its distinct botanical identity."
