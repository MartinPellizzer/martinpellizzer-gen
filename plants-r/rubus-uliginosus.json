    "intro": "Rubus uliginosus, commonly known as the swamp blackberry, is a perennial shrub native to wetland habitats in the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its prickly stems and clusters of small, dark red berries that ripen in late summer. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, fens, and other wetland environments. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it produces white to pale pink flowers in the spring. Rubus uliginosus plays an important role in supporting local wildlife, including birds and insects."
