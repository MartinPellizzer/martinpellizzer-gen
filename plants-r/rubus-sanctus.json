    "intro": "Rubus sanctus, commonly known as the sacred raspberry, is a species of bramble native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its erect, thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or yellow in color, resembling raspberries in appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and cooler climates, often growing in rocky or forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and unique habitat, Rubus sanctus is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
