    "intro": "Rosa palustris, commonly known as the swamp rose, is a deciduous shrub native to wetlands and marshy areas of North America. It features slender, arching stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The plant produces fragrant, pink to white flowers in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and covered in fine, silky hairs. Rosa palustris is adapted to moist soils and plays an important role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems."
