It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and thorny stems, which help it anchor to the ground. The leaves are typically compound, with three leaflets that are oval and serrated. Its flowers are white and clustered, producing small, dark purple berries that are edible. This plant thrives in moist, temperate climates and is often found in coastal areas and along riverbanks."
