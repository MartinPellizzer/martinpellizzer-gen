    "intro": "Restrepia portillae, commonly known as the Portilla's orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It belongs to the Epidendroideae subfamily and is characterized by its sympodial growth habit. The plant produces intricate, showy flowers with a distinctive coloration pattern, often featuring a mix of white, yellow, and green hues. Its pseudobulbs are elongated and covered in a thick layer of brownish fur, which helps in water retention. Restrepia portillae thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil for optimal growth."
