    "intro": "Ranunculus longicaulis var. pulchellus, commonly known as the purple buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features finely divided, fern-like leaves and produces showy, single flowers with five petal-like sepals in shades of purple or yellow. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. It is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats at high elevations. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in some regions."
