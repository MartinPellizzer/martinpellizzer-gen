    "intro": "Rubus rivularis var. viridis, commonly known as the green-stemmed bramble, is a variant of the common blackberry species found in moist, shaded environments. It is characterized by its slender, greenish stems and small, trifoliate leaves. The flowers are typically white or pale pink, and the fruit is a small, edible berry similar to other Rubus species. This plant prefers rich, loamy soils and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological studies of understory vegetation."
