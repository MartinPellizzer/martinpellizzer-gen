    "intro": "Ricinus communis var. borboniensis, commonly known as the Bourbon castor plant, is a variant of the castor oil plant native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves and distinctive spiny seed capsules. The plant produces toxic seeds containing ricin, a potent toxin, which makes it hazardous if ingested. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soil and full sunlight. This variant is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its striking foliage."
