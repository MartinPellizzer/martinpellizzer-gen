    "intro": "Rubus pallidus subsp. curvistylus, commonly known as the pale bramble, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, thorny stems and small, white to pale pink flowers. The leaves are typically trifoliate, with three leaflets that are ovate to elliptic in shape. The fruit, a raspberry-like aggregate, is usually red and edible, though the flavor is mild compared to other Rubus species. This subspecies thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and forest edges."
