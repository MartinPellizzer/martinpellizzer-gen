    "intro": "Rosa spinosissima f. spreta, commonly known as the Spanish pink or the spiny Rosa, is a hybrid form of the Rosa spinosissima species. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and clusters of fragrant, semi-double pink flowers. The plant typically grows in shrub form, reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters. Its leaves are dark green, glossy, and deeply lobed, providing a striking contrast to the showy blooms. This variety is well-suited for hedges or as a decorative plant in gardens due to its ornamental value and hardy nature."
