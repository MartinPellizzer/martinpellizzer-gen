    "intro": "Rosa communis var. glaberrima, commonly known as the naked-stemmed rose, is a less commonly cultivated variety of the rose plant. It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous stems and smaller, delicate flowers compared to other rose species. This variety is native to certain regions of Asia and is often found in mountainous areas. The plant produces fragrant, pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticultural collections for its unique appearance."
