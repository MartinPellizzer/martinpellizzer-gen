    "intro": "Rudbeckia hirta var. monticola, commonly known as the mountain rudbeckia, is a perennial flowering plant native to the central and northern United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and daisy-like yellow-orange flower heads, which are surrounded by greenish-blue ray florets. The plant typically grows in rocky or open habitats, such as prairies and mountain slopes, and thrives in full sun. Its leaves are hairy and lance-shaped, contributing to its drought tolerance. Rudbeckia hirta var. monticola is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
