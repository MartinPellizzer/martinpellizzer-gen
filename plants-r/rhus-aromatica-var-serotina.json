    "intro": "Rhus aromatica var. serotina, commonly known as smooth sumac, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern and central United States. It features compound leaves with 15 to 31 pairs of serrated leaflets, which turn vibrant shades of red in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in upright clusters, followed by red, fuzzy fruits that disperse seeds by wind. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in dry, rocky soils. Smooth sumac has historical uses in traditional medicine and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
