    "intro": "Rosa canina var. urbica, commonly known as the urban rose, is a variant of the dog rose that has adapted to thrive in urban environments. It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its thorny stems and small, fragrant pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The leaves are pinnately compound, with five to seven leaflets, and the plant produces red-orange hips that contain seeds. It is often found growing along sidewalks, in gardens, and in other disturbed soils in cities. This variety is valued for its hardiness and ability to withstand pollution and compacted soil."
