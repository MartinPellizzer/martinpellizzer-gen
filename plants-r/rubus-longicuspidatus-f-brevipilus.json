    "intro": "Rubus longicuspidatus f. brevipilus, commonly known as the short-hairy blackberry, is a variant of the long-pointed blackberry. It is characterized by its shorter, more densely packed hairs on the stems and leaves compared to the typical form. The plant produces dark purple to black berries that are typically smaller than those of the standard species. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and sometimes rare form within the Rubus genus."
