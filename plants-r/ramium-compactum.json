    "intro": "Ramium compactum, commonly known as the compact bluemink, is a low-growing evergreen perennial native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It features dense, silver-gray foliage with a mat-forming growth habit, making it ideal for ground cover in rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers in late spring, which are clustered in dense spikes. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Its compact size and ornamental foliage make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
