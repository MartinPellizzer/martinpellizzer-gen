    "intro": "Ribes \u00d7 knightii, commonly known as the hybrid currant, is a deciduous shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is a cross between *Ribes sanguineum* (red currant) and *Ribes aureum* (gold currant), resulting in a plant with distinctive ornamental features. The leaves are typically oval with serrated edges and can range in color from dark green to reddish in the fall. It produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers in early spring, followed by edible red berries that ripen in late summer. This plant is valued for its hardiness, adaptability, and aesthetic appeal in both gardens and natural landscapes."
