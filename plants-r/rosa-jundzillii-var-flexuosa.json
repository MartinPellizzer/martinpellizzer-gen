    "intro": "Rosa jundzillii var. flexuosa, commonly known as the flexible shrub rose, is a climbing variety native to the Canary Islands. It features long, arching stems that can reach up to 3 meters in length, making it well-suited for trellises or espalier techniques. The plant produces fragrant, semi-double pink flowers in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are dark green, glossy, and have a slightly serrated edge. It is relatively drought-tolerant once established and thrives in full sun to partial shade."
