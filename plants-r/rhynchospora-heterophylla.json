    "intro": "Rhynchospora heterophylla, commonly known as the variable spike-rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and other grass-like plants. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, and its leaves are often variable in shape, contributing to its common name. It produces small, clustered flower spikes that bloom in late spring to early summer. Rhynchospora heterophylla plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
