    "intro": "Rosa \u00d7 subcanina var. brachypoda, commonly known as the short-stemmed Rosa subcanina, is a hybrid rose species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense, thornless stems that often appear shorter than those of its parent species. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its foliage is dark green and leathery, providing a striking contrast to the pale blossoms. This variety is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various garden conditions."
