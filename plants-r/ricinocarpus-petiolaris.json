    "intro": "Ricinocarpus petiolaris, commonly known as the sea hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Pacific and Indian Oceans. It is a shrub or small tree characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and large, showy flowers that range in color from yellow to red. The plant has palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, and its fruits are capsule-like structures that release seeds when mature. It thrives in saline environments and is often found in mangrove ecosystems, contributing to coastal vegetation and soil stabilization."
