    "intro": "Rubus yakusimensis, commonly known as Yakushima blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the subtropical forests of Yakushima Island in Japan. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and the production of small, dark purple berries. The plant has serrated leaves and produces white or pale pink flowers in the spring. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the undergrowth of evergreen forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
