    "intro": "Raphia vinifera var. nigerica, commonly known as the Nigerian palm, is a tall, fast-growing palm native to tropical regions of Africa. It features large, pinnate leaves that can reach lengths of up to 10 meters, making it a striking landscape element. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-white flowers followed by elongated, fibrous fruits. Its trunk is robust and covered with a fibrous outer layer, which is harvested for thatch and rope-making. This species is well adapted to humid, tropical climates and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soils."
