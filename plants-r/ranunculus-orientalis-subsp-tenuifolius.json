    "intro": "Ranunculus orientalis subsp. tenuifolius, commonly known as the slender-leaved buttercup, is a species of flowering plant in the Ranunculaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, yellow flowers with five petals and bright green, lance-shaped leaves. Native to Central Asia, it thrives in moist, temperate environments and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. The plant has a short stem and produces small, hairy fruits that disperse its seeds by wind. Its botanical features make it a notable subject in both horticulture and ecological studies."
