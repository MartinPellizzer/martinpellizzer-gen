    "intro": "Robinia triflora, commonly known as the three-flowered robinia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and have a silvery underside. The plant produces fragrant, yellowish-white flowers in clusters of three, which bloom in early spring. Its wood is hard and durable, historically used for furniture and shipbuilding. Robinia triflora is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in various soil conditions."
