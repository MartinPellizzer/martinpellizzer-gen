    "intro": "Ribesiodes parviflorum, commonly known as the small-flower honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to parts of Asia. It features slender, arching branches that bear small, fragrant white or yellow flowers in early summer. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible for birds but not typically for humans. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and prefers moist, well-drained soil. Its ornamental value comes from its delicate foliage and attractive floral display."
