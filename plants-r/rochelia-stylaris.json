    "intro": "Rochelia stylaris, commonly known as the slender sea rocket, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Brassicaceae. It is a halophyte, meaning it thrives in saline environments such as coastal areas and salt marshes. The plant has small, green, succulent leaves that help it retain water in arid conditions. Its flowers are typically yellow or white, arranged in racemes, and it produces small, round pods containing seeds. Rochelia stylaris plays an important role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various small organisms."
