    "intro": "Rhinanthus minor, commonly known as the lesser burnet, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Scrophulariaceae family and typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. The plant produces clusters of small, reddish-orange flowers that bloom from June to August. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, and it often forms dense colonies in suitable environments. Rhinanthus minor is known for its ability to thrive in poor soils and its role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
