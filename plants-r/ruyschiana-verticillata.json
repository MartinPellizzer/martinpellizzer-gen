It is characterized by its distinctive whorled arrangement of leaves, which gives it its scientific name \"verticillata.\" The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Native to South America, it thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial shade. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely used in horticulture."
