    "intro": "Rorippa tanacetifolia, commonly known as the watercress, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its small, serrated leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in moist environments, such as stream banks and wet meadows, and is often found in shallow water. Its leaves are edible and have a peppery flavor, making it a popular ingredient in salads and soups. The plant is also known for its ability to absorb heavy metals from the soil, which makes it useful in phytoremediation efforts."
