    "intro": "Roupala bleasdalei, commonly known as the Bleasdale's roupala, is a rare and unique plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Sapindaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves that are often lobed and have a velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by spherical, red berries that contain several seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Roupala bleasdalei is considered a rare species with conservation concerns."
