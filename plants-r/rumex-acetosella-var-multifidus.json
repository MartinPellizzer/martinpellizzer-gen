    "intro": "Rumex acetosella var. multifidus, commonly known as sourgrass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are often reddish in color and have a serrated edge. The plant produces clusters of tiny, greenish flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by reddish-brown seeds. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of streams. This variety is distinguished by its finely divided leaves, which give it a more delicate appearance compared to other Rumex species."
