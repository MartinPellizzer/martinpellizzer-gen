    "intro": "Ranunculus lappaceus var. pseudoplebeius, commonly known as the alpine buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a basal rosette of pinnately lobed, hairy leaves that are adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. The plant produces showy yellow flowers with five sepals and numerous stamens, typical of the Ranunculaceae family. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and slopes. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator of high-altitude ecosystems."
