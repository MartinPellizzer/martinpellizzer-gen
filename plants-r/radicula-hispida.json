    "intro": "Radicula hispida, commonly known as the hispid radicula, is a small, herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant features a compact, sprawling growth habit with small, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss. Its flowers are usually pale green to yellowish, and it produces small, dry fruits that disperse seeds by wind. Radicula hispida is often found in disturbed or open habitats, such as along roadsides and in desert scrublands."
