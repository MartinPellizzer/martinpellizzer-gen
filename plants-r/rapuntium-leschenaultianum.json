    "intro": "Rapuntium leschenaultianum, commonly known as the Leschenault's cress, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing perennial that produces small, bright yellow flowers in early spring. The plant has alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its natural distribution across rocky and disturbed areas."
