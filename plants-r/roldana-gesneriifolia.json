    "intro": "Roldana gesneriifolia, commonly known as the silver leaf geranium, is a perennial flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its striking silver-green foliage and clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its ornamental value comes from both its foliage and blooms, which are often used in landscaping for their visual appeal.
