    "intro": "Rubus retusipetalus, commonly known as the smooth-petaled blackberry, is a species of bramble native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces aggregate fruits composed of small, dark purple to black achenes surrounded by a fleshy receptacle. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and thickets. Its botanical features make it distinct from other Rubus species, particularly in its smooth-petaled flowers and fruit structure."
