    "intro": "Ranunculus paludosus var. acutilobus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It features delicate, yellow flowers with five petals and a hairy, ribbed stem that often grows from water or moist soil. The leaves are typically deeply lobed and have a waxy surface to reduce water loss. This variant is distinguished by its narrow, acute leaf lobes compared to other varieties of Ranunculus paludosus. It plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by providing food and habitat for various invertebrates."
