It is characterized by its cascading clusters of fragrant pink or white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, arching stems that give it a drooping appearance, and its leaves are compound, consisting of multiple oval-shaped leaflets. Native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, it thrives in well-drained soil and full sun. Rosa pendulina is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its aesthetic appeal and delicate floral display."
