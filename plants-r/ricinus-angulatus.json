    "intro": "Ricinus angulatus, commonly known as the angular castor oil plant, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive angular, ribbed leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in cyathia, typical of the genus Ricinus. Its seeds contain toxic compounds, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals. Despite its toxicity, it is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its unique foliage."
