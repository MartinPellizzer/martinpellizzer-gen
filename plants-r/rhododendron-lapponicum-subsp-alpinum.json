    "intro": "Rhododendron lapponicum subsp. alpinum, commonly known as the Alpine Lapland rhododendron, is a low-growing shrub native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Eurasia. It features dense, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in cold, dry environments. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or barren habitats. This subspecies is adapted to harsh climatic conditions, making it a resilient component of tundra and alpine ecosystems."
