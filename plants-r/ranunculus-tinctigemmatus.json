It features showy, globe-shaped flowers that are typically purple or blue in color, with a distinctive central tuft of stamens. The plant has palmately divided leaves and thrives in cool, moist environments. It is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes at high elevations. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it requires specific growing conditions to flourish."
