It is characterized by its vibrant blue petals and a distinctive, lip-like structure that is often a different color, typically white or purple. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Its flowers bloom in late spring or early summer, adding a splash of color to its natural habitat. Rhynchoglossum azureum is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological role in supporting pollinator species."
