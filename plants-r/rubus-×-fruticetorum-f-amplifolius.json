    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 fruticetorum f. amplifolius, commonly known as the broadleaf blackberry, is a hybrid shrub characterized by its robust growth and large, serrated leaves. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is native to parts of North America, where it thrives in a variety of soil types. The plant produces dark purple to black berries that are typically harvested in late summer. Its foliage is dense and often used for erosion control due to its vigorous root system. The broadleaf variety distinguishes it from other Rubus species by its wider, more prominent leaves."
