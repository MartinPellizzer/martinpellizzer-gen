    "intro": "Rubus eliasii, commonly known as the Elias's blackberry, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is native to the Pacific Northwest of North America, particularly found in moist, shaded areas of forests. The plant produces dark purple to black berries that are typically small and have a tart flavor. Its leaves are compound, with three to five leaflets, and the plant has thorny stems typical of many Rubus species. It plays an important ecological role by providing food for wildlife and contributing to forest understory biodiversity."
