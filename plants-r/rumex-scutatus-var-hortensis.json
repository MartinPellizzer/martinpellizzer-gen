    "intro": "Rumex scutatus var. hortensis, commonly known as garden sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It features heart-shaped, reddish-veined leaves that are often cultivated for their tangy, sour taste. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which appear in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread easily in moist, fertile soils. It is often grown as a leafy vegetable or used in ornamental gardening for its attractive foliage."
