    "intro": "Rosa \u00d7 collina var. mygindi, commonly known as the Mygindi rock rose, is a hybrid shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense, thorny stems that often grow along rocky surfaces. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant pink or white flowers in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are dark green, narrow, and slightly hairy, adapted to withstand harsh alpine conditions. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in poor, well-drained soils."
