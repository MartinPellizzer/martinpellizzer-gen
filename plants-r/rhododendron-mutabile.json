    "intro": "Rhododendron mutabile, commonly known as the variable rhododendron, is a species native to the eastern Himalayas. It is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to white and sometimes red. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
