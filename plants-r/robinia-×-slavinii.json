    "intro": "Robinia \u00d7 slavinii, commonly known as the Slavin's false acacia, is a hybrid deciduous shrub or small tree resulting from the cross between Robinia pseudoacacia (black locust) and Robinia auriculata (golden locust). It features compound leaves with oval to lance-shaped leaflets that are typically bright green and turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers in racemes during late spring to early summer. It is native to the eastern United States and is valued for its ornamental qualities and rapid growth. However, it can be invasive in some regions due to its vigorous growth and seed dispersal capabilities."
