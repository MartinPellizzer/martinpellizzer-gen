    "intro": "Rupiphila, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family. These plants are characterized by their unique adaptations to rocky and arid environments, often growing on cliffs or in crevices. Rupiphila species typically have compact, low-growing structures with specialized roots that anchor them to steep surfaces. Their flowers are usually small and inconspicuous, often with a greenish or brownish hue. Due to their specific habitat requirements, many species of Rupiphila are rare and face threats from habitat destruction and climate change."
