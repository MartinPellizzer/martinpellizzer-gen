    "intro": "Rafnia capensis subsp. capensis, commonly known as the Cape rafnsia, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems and opposite, simple leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by woody, spherical fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens, though it requires full sun and minimal water."
