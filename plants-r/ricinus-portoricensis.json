    "intro": "Ricinus portoricensis, commonly known as the Puerto Rican castor bean, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean island of Puerto Rico. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves and striking red bracts. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain toxic seeds, similar to other species in the Ricinus genus. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in coastal areas and forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
