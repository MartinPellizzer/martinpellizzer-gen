    "intro": "Rhizophora mangle, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a salt-tolerant tree native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its prop roots, which extend from its trunk into the water, providing structural support and aiding in oxygen absorption. The plant has specialized glands that excrete excess salt, allowing it to thrive in saline environments. Its pneumatophores, or breathing roots, emerge from the soil to facilitate gas exchange in waterlogged soils. Rhizophora mangle plays a vital role in coastal ecosystems by stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species."
