    "intro": "Ruppia maritima subsp. brevirostris, commonly known as the narrow-beaked sea rocket, is a halophyte adapted to saline environments. It is characterized by its small, green, fleshy leaves and produces tiny, yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in intertidal zones and shallow coastal waters, often forming dense underwater vegetation. It plays a crucial role in stabilizing sediments and providing habitat for aquatic organisms. Its subsp. brevirostris differs from the typical subspecies by its shorter, more robust leaves and distinct floral morphology."
