    "intro": "Ranunculus alticaulis, commonly known as the alpine buttercup, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers with five to eight petals, often surrounded by a ring of green sepals. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky areas, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are palmately lobed and covered in fine hairs, which help protect it from harsh environmental conditions. Ranunculus alticaulis is an important component of high-altitude ecosystems and is often found in alpine tundra habitats."
