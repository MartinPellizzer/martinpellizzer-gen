    "intro": "Ranunculus decrescens, commonly known as the creeping buttercup, is a low-growing perennial herb native to North America. It features a mat-forming growth habit with rhizomes that allow it to spread across moist, often disturbed soils. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with five sepals and no true petals, typical of the Ranunculaceae family. Its leaves are deeply lobed and can be covered in fine hairs, while its stems are prostrate and often reddish in color. It thrives in wetland environments and is often found in marshes, stream banks, and other moist habitats."
