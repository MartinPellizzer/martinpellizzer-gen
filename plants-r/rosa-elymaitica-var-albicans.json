    "intro": "Rosa elymaitica var. albicans, commonly known as the white shrub rose, is a rare and ancient species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, thorny shrubs and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is adapted to harsh, arid environments and has a deep root system that allows it to survive in poor soil conditions. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, and it produces rose hips that are rich in vitamin C. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
