    "intro": "Ranunculus fallax subsp. emersus, commonly known as the water buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It features delicate, palmately lobed leaves and bright yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in early spring. The plant thrives in moist or aquatic environments, often found along the edges of ponds, ditches, and marshes. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable conditions. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
