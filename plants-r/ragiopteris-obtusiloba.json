    "intro": "Ragiopteris obtusiloba, commonly known as the broad-lobed ragiopteris, is a rare fern native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, broad, and deeply lobed fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments such as tropical rainforests. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
