    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 albomicans, commonly known as the white-fruited blackberry, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Rubus ursinus and Rubus strigosus. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow fruits that are typically less flavorful compared to other blackberry varieties. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland areas or along the edges of forests. Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits a range of morphological variations, making it a subject of interest in botanical studies."
