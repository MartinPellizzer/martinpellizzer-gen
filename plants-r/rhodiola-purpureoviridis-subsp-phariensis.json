    "intro": "Rhodiola purpureoviridis subsp. phariensis, commonly known as the Tibetan rhodiola, is a perennial flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and fleshy, rhizomatous roots that help it survive in cold and arid environments. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often blooming in late summer. It thrives in rocky soils and is adapted to low oxygen levels at high elevations. Due to its resilience and medicinal properties, it is of interest in both botanical research and traditional medicine."
