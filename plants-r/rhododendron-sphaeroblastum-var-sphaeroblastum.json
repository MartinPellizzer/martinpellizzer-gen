    "intro": "Rhododendron sphaeroblastum var. sphaeroblastum, commonly known as the spherical-leaved rhododendron, is a rare and unique species native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are round or oval in shape, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and requires a cool, humid climate. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered an endangered species."
