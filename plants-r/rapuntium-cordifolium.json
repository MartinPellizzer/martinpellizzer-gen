    "intro": "Rapuntium cordifolium, commonly known as the heart-leaf rapunculus, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of heart-shaped leaves and produces showy yellow flowers with prominent black centers. The plant is perennial, thriving in cool, moist environments and often found in alpine meadows. Its leaves are edible when young, though they become more bitter with age. The species is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its historical use in traditional medicine."
