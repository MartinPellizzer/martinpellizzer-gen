    "intro": "Rafnia elliptica, commonly known as the elliptical sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Africa and Southeast Asia. It typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are elliptical in shape, giving it its common name. Its flowering stems produce small, inconspicuous greenish flowers that are often clustered in spikes. Rafnia elliptica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in water gardens or as a ground cover in wet areas."
