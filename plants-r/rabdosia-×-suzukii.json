    "intro": "Rabdosia \u00d7 suzukii, commonly known as the hybrid beautyberry, is a flowering plant in the Lamiaceae family. It is a natural hybrid between Rabdosia kiusiana and Rabdosia chinensis, characterized by its striking purple to violet berries. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories in Southeast Asia. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and it produces small, tubular flowers that are usually pale blue or purple. The berries, which are edible for some bird species, ripen in late summer and contribute to the plant's ornamental value."
