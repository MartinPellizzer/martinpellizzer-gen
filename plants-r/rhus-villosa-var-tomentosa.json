    "intro": "Rhus villosa var. tomentosa, commonly known as the stinkbush or smooth sumac, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and covered in a dense, woolly pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in upright clusters, followed by red, fuzzy berries that are an important food source for birds. Its bark is smooth and light gray, with a distinctive, aromatic scent when crushed. This species is often found in open woodlands and disturbed soils, and it plays a role in supporting local wildlife and ecological diversity."
