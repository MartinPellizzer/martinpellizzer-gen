    "intro": "Rosa nemoralis, commonly known as the bramble rose, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of fragrant, pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces rosehips, which are ornamental and contain seeds. Rosa nemoralis thrives in woodland edges and hedgerows, preferring well-drained soil and partial shade. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal medicine."
