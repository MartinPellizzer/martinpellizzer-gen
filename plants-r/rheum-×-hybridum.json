    "intro": "Rheum \u00d7 hybridum, commonly known as the ornamental rhubarb, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Rheum palmatum and Rheum rhaponticum. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 60 cm in length, often with a reddish or purple hue on the underside. The plant produces tall, reddish stems with clusters of small, yellow flowers in the spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers partial to full sun. Rheum \u00d7 hybridum is primarily cultivated for its ornamental value rather than its edible rhubarb stalks."
