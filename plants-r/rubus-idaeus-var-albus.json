This plant is native to parts of Europe and Asia and thrives in temperate climates. Its foliage consists of compound leaves with serrated edges, typical of the Rubus genus. The berries, though less commonly cultivated than the red variety, are edible and have a milder flavor. It is often grown for ornamental purposes due to its attractive appearance and unique coloration."
