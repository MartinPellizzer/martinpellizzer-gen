    "intro": "Rhododendron forrestii var. repens, commonly known as the creeping rhododendron, is a low-growing evergreen shrub characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. It features broad, ovate leaves that are typically dark green and glossy, with a leathery texture. The plant produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to form thick ground covers, suppressing weeds and stabilizing soil in shaded environments."
