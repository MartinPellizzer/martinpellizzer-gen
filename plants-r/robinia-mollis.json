It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and covered in soft, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, typical of the Fabaceae family. Its flowers are fragrant and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Robinia mollis is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardy nature."
