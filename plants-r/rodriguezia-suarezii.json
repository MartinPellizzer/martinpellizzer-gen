    "intro": "Rodriguezia suarezii, commonly known as the Su\u00e1rez's rodriguezia, is a striking tropical plant native to the rainforests of Colombia. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in diameter. The plant produces showy, red-orange flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators such as birds and insects. Its ornamental value makes it a sought-after species in horticulture, though it requires a humid, warm climate to thrive. Due to habitat loss, it is also considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
