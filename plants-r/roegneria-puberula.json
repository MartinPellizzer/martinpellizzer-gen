    "intro": "Roegneria puberula, commonly known as the silky wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, bluish-green leaves covered with fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear pale green to brownish flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along streambanks. Roegneria puberula is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
