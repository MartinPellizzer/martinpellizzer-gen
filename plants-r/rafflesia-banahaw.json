    "intro": "Rafflesia banahaw, commonly known as the \"Banahaw Rafflesia,\" is a rare and striking parasitic plant found in the montane forests of the Philippines. It is characterized by its large, reddish-orange\u82b1\u6735 with a complex structure that includes a central fleshy body and numerous petals. The plant lacks leaves, stems, and roots, relying entirely on its host, the Tetrastigma vine, for nutrients. Its flowers emit a strong, unpleasant odor reminiscent of decaying flesh, which attracts flies and other insects for pollination. Due to its limited distribution and habitat loss, Rafflesia banahaw is considered critically endangered and is a symbol of the unique biodiversity of the Philippines."
