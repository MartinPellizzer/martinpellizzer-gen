    "intro": "Rosa trachyphylla f. typica, commonly known as the roughleaf dogwood rose, is a compact, thorny shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features dark green, ovate leaves with a rough, glandular texture on the underside, which gives it its common name. The plant produces fragrant, semi-double pink flowers in late spring to early summer. It is well-suited for small gardens and can thrive in partial shade to full sun. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and showy blooms, making it a popular choice for ornamental hedges and borders."
