It has yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with fungi, allowing it to absorb nutrients from host plants. It plays an important role in promoting biodiversity by reducing competitive pressure on grasses."
