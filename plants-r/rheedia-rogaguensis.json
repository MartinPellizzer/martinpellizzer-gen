    "intro": "Rheedia rogaguensis, commonly known as the Rogaguense Rheedia, is a flowering plant native to the rainforests of Central America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom during the wet season. Rheedia rogaguensis is typically found growing in moist, shaded areas along riverbanks and in dense undergrowth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
