It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many species of shrubs and climbers. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit, small leaves, and clusters of tiny white or pale yellow flowers. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as mountain forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a delicate and ecologically significant species."
