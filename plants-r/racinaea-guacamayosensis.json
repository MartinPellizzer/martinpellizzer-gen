    "intro": "Racinaea guacamayosensis, commonly known as the Guacamayos racemose orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the cloud forests of Central America. It is characterized by its striking, elongated inflorescence that bears numerous fragrant, white to pale pink flowers. The plant has fleshy, strap-like leaves that help it conserve moisture in its humid, shaded habitat. It thrives in high elevation areas with consistent moisture and indirect light. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in the wild."
