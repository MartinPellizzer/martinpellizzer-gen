    "intro": "Rumex \u00d7 nankingensis, commonly known as Chinese sorrel, is a hybrid plant that results from the cross between Rumex acetosa (common sorrel) and Rumex scutatus (arrowleaf dock). It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its broad, arrow-shaped leaves and reddish veins. The plant typically grows in moist, fertile soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and waste grounds. Its flowers are small and clustered in loose spikes, and it produces capsule fruits containing several seeds. The plant is valued for its edible leaves, which have a tart, sour flavor similar to sorrel."
