    "intro": "Rubus hirtus microgene reconditiformis, commonly known as the rare velvet raspberry, is a botanical species characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and small, clustered flowers. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is notable for its unique morphology, including its finely textured leaves and pale pink to white blooms. The plant is typically found in shaded, moist environments such as woodland understories or rocky slopes. Its fruit, a small, tart berry, is edible but not commonly cultivated. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
