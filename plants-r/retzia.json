    "intro": "Retzia, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Polygonaceae. These plants are characterized by their striking, often bioluminescent flowers that emit a faint glow in the dark. Retzia species are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in moist, shaded environments. Their unique floral structures attract specific pollinators, such as moths and beetles, due to their nocturnal blooming habit. The genus is noted for its ornamental value and ecological significance in its native habitats."
