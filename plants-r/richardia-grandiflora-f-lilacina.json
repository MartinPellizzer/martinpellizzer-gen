    "intro": "Richardia grandiflora f. lilacina, commonly known as the lilac-flowered richardia, is a flowering plant belonging to the Acanthaceae family. It is characterized by its showy, lilac-pink bracts that resemble petals, which are actually modified leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences at the base of the bracts. Native to tropical regions of South America, it thrives in warm, humid environments with well-drained soil. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens and as a specimen plant in tropical landscapes."
