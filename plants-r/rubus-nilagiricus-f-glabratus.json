    "intro": "Rubus nilagiricus f. glabratus, commonly known as the smooth-fruited raspberry, is a variant of the raspberry plant native to the Himalayan regions of India. It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous fruit surface, distinguishing it from the typical hairy-fruited varieties. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits composed of multiple achenes, which are typically reddish in color. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. This subspecies is valued for its unique fruit texture and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental or culinary purposes."
