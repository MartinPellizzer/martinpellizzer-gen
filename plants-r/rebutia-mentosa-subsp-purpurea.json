It features a short, thick stem with dense clusters of small, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a purple tinge. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with prominent red bracts during the spring and summer seasons. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting."
