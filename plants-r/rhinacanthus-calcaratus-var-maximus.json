    "intro": "Rhinacanthus calcaratus var. maximus, commonly known as the giant flame tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy, orange-red bracts that resemble flames, which are actually modified leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers clustered in panicles, followed by woody, spherical fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The tree has a shallow root system, making it suitable for areas with well-drained soil."
