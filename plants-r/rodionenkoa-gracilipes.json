    "intro": "Rodionenkoa gracilipes, commonly known as the slender-stemmed orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, pale greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, contributing to its elegant appearance. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural habitat."
