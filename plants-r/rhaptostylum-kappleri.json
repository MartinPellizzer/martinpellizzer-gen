    "intro": "Rhaptostylum kappleri, commonly known as the Kappler's rhaptostylum, is a rare and lesser-known plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and woody stems. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest understories, where it relies on specific soil conditions and humidity levels for survival. Its foliage is evergreen, with lance-shaped leaves that have a smooth, glossy surface. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Rhaptostylum kappleri is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
