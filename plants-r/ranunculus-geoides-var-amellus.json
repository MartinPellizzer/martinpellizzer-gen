    "intro": "Ranunculus geoides var. amellus, commonly known as the alpine buttercup, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is a member of the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its showy, yellow flowers with a distinctive central tuft of stamens. The plant typically grows in rocky, alpine habitats and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are palmately divided and covered in fine, soft hairs, while its stems are often hairy and erect. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
