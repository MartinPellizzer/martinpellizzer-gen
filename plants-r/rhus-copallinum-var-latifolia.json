    "intro": "Rhus copallinum var. latifolia, commonly known as the smooth sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically composed of 15\u201331 pairs of elliptical, serrated leaflets. The plant produces bright red, fuzzy fruits that mature in the fall, providing a striking visual display. Its bark is smooth and grayish, often exfoliating to reveal a lighter inner layer. Smooth sumac is commonly found in disturbed soils and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in various conditions."
