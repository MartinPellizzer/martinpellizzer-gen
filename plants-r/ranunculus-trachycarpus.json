    "intro": "Ranunculus trachycarpus, commonly known as the rough buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features finely divided, fern-like leaves and produces showy, yellow flowers with prominent, hairy sepals. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along streambanks. Its flowers are typically 3 to 5 cm in diameter, and it blooms from late spring to early summer. The species is notable for its ability to tolerate wet conditions and is sometimes used in water gardens or as a ornamental plant."
