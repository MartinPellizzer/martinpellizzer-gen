    "intro": "Rubus castellanus, commonly known as the stoneberry, is a species of bramble native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits known as drupes, which are typically red or black in color. It thrives in woodland edges, hedgerows, and disturbed soils, often forming dense thickets. Due to its hardy nature, it plays an important role in supporting local wildlife and maintaining biodiversity in its habitat."
