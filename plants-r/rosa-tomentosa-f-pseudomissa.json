    "intro": "Rosa tomentosa f. pseudomissa, commonly known as the woolly rose or the alpine rose, is a compact shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features dense, grayish-white pubescence covering its stems and leaves, giving it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink to white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its cold-hardy nature. This variety is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in cooler, high-altitude environments."
