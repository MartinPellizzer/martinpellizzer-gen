    "intro": "Ranunculus ficaria var. obtusissimus, commonly known as the broad-leaved buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features basal leaves that are broadly ovate to round, with a waxy surface and a distinctive white or pale yellow flower that has five to seven petals. The plant produces small, yellowish-green sepals that are often mistaken for petals, and it blooms from late spring to early summer. It prefers moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. The species is characterized by its showy, delicate appearance and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes."
