    "intro": "Ranunculus bongardii var. tenellus, commonly known as the dwarf Bongard buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features delicate, cup-shaped flowers with five to eight petals, typically in shades of yellow or orange, and a hairy stem that supports its small, palmately lobed leaves. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Its flowers bloom in early spring, adding a vibrant touch to its natural surroundings. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it requires specific conditions to flourish."
