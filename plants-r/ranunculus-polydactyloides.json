    "intro": "Ranunculus polydactyloides, commonly known as the many-fingered buttercup, is a species of flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, spurred petals and a hairy stem, which help it thrive in its alpine habitat. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Its leaves are palmately lobed, giving it a distinctive appearance, and it produces yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
