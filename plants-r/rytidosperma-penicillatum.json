It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and dunes. Rytidosperma penicillatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is used in native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
