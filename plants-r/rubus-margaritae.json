    "intro": "Rubus margaritae, commonly known as the silverleaf blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the western United States. It is characterized by its silvery-white undersides on its leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, dark berries that are typically edible, though they are often tart and less flavorful than other blackberry varieties. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, rocky habitats. The shrub is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
