    "intro": "Rosa gothica, commonly known as the ghost rose, is a species of shrub native to northern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its pale pink to almost white flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are compound, with five to seven leaflets, and the stems are often covered in thorns. Rosa gothica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
