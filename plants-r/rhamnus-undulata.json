    "intro": "Rhamnus undulata, commonly known as the wavy buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its smooth, dark green leaves that have a wavy or undulating margin, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by dark blue berries that are edible for birds and some mammals. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in chaparral and woodland habitats. Rhamnus undulata has a compact growth habit and is sometimes used in landscaping for its ornamental value."
