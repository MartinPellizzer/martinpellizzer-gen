    "intro": "Rumex acetosa subsp. arifolius, commonly known as narrow-leaved sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features upright, branched stems that are typically hairy, and its leaves are elongated with a distinctive arrowhead shape, giving it its subspecific name. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are edible, though they contain oxalic acid and should be consumed in moderation. It thrives in moist, fertile soils and is often found in woodland edges, meadows, and along stream banks."
