It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its woody structure and small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments within the montane rainforests of Negros Island. Its leaves are elliptical with a glossy surface, and it produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or white in color. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species."
