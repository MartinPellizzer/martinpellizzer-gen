    "intro": "Rubus nemorensis var. purpurascens, commonly known as the purple-leaf bramble, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, thorny growth habit and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early summer. The leaves are typically oval-shaped with a distinctive purple hue on the underside, giving the plant its common name. Its berries are small, red, and edible, though they are not as widely cultivated as other raspberry varieties. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and rocky areas."
