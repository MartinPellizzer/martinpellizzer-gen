    "intro": "Racosperma anarthron, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family Fabaceae. It is native to eastern Australia and is characterized by its slender, compound leaves and yellow flowers. The plant is a shrub or small tree, typically growing to a height of 1\u20133 meters. It has small, pod-like fruits that contain seeds, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its association with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Racosperma anarthron is often found in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to coastal and inland environments."
