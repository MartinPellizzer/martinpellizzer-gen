    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus subsp. carlittensis, commonly known as the Carlitt's buttercup, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its bright yellow petals and deeply lobed leaves, typical of the Ranunculaceae family. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly smaller size and more rounded leaf shape compared to the typical form of R. auricomus. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. The plant blooms in early spring, adding a vibrant touch of color to its natural habitat."
