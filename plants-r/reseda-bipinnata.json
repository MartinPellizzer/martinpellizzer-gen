    "intro": "Reseda bipinnata, commonly known as yellow rattle, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, yellow, cruciform flowers. The plant produces slender, hairy stems that bear alternate leaves with a bipinnate structure, giving it a finely divided appearance. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and heaths. Reseda bipinnata is also known for its role in ecological systems, as its flowers provide nectar for pollinators like bees and butterflies."
