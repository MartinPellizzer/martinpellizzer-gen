    "intro": "Rosa nummularia, commonly known as the penny rose, is a low-growing, evergreen shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features dense clusters of small, fragrant pink or white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has rounded, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. It is well-suited for rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its compact growth habit. Rosa nummularia is relatively hardy and can thrive in full sun to partial shade."
