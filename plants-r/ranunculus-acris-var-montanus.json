    "intro": "Ranunculus acris var. montanus, commonly known as the alpine buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It features delicate, yellow flowers with five to eight petals, typically surrounded by a ring of sepals that resemble additional petals. The plant has a short, stout stem that grows from a rhizome, and its leaves are palmately divided with a hairy surface. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in meadows and rocky slopes at high altitudes. Due to its ornamental value, it is also cultivated in gardens, though it requires specific growing conditions to flourish."
