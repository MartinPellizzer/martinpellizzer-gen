    "intro": "Rubus gustafssonii, commonly known as the Gustafsson's blackberry, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of southern Scandinavia, particularly in Sweden and Norway. The plant is characterized by its thorny stems, trifoliate leaves, and small, aggregate fruits that mature to a dark purple or black color. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in forested areas or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
