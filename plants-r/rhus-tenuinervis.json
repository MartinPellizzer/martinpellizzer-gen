    "intro": "Rhus tenuinervis, commonly known as the narrow-veined sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often divided into numerous narrow, lance-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by bright red, berry-like fruits that are a food source for birds and mammals. Rhus tenuinervis thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and bottomlands. Its botanical features make it an important component of riparian ecosystems."
