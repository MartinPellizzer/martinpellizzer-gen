    "intro": "Rosa svanetica var. elongata, commonly known as the elongated Caucasian rose, is a rare and ornamental shrub native to the Caucasus region. It features slender, arching stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, with simple, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white or grey pubescence. The flowers are typically pink to red, with five to seven petals, and bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a specimen plant. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable species for botanical conservation efforts."
