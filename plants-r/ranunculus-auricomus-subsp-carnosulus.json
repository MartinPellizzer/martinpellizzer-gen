    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus subsp. carnosulus, commonly known as the alpine buttercup, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features showy, yellow flowers with five broadly ovate petals that are often tinged with red or orange at the base. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky habitats, thriving in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a hairy surface that helps reduce water loss in high-altitude environments. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly fleshy, succulent leaves and stems, which are adaptations to its harsh, arid mountainous habitat."
