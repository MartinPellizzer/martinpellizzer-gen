    "intro": "Rosa abietina f. hystrix, commonly known as the Alpine rose or mountain rose, is a botanical variant of the Rosa abietina species. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is native to the mountainous regions of Europe and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Its leaves are typically dark green and covered with a fine layer of white hairs, which help to reduce water loss in harsh conditions. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and resilience in rocky, high-altitude habitats."
