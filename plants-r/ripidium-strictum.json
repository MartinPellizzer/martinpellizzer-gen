    "intro": "Ripidium strictum, commonly known as the rigid reed, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and rivers, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant has slender, upright stems that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of small, spike-like flowers that are typically greenish or brownish in color. Ripidium strictum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various insect and bird species."
