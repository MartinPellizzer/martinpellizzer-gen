    "intro": "Ranunculus ficaria subsp. fertilis, commonly known as the European buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features delicate, bright yellow flowers with five petals and a hairy, lobed leaf structure. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It has a short rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread vegetatively. Its flowers bloom in early spring, and it is often found in association with other shade-tolerant flora."
