It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically elliptical in shape with a slightly serrated margin. The plant produces fragrant, pink to white flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its stems are covered in fine, glandular hairs, and it is often found growing in coastal areas with well-drained soil. Rosa aginnensis is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique appearance."
