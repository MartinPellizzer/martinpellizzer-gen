    "intro": "Riedelia geanthus, commonly known as the purple sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and clusters of small, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its flowers, which range in color from white to purple, bloom in the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Riedelia geanthus is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
