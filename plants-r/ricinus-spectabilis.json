    "intro": "Ricinus spectabilis, commonly known as the showy castor oil plant, is a striking ornamental species native to the southeastern United States. It is a herbaceous annual with large, palmate leaves that can reach up to 12 inches in diameter, often with a reddish or purple tint. The plant produces unique, spiky seed capsules that turn from green to orange as they mature. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil. Due to its ornamental value and potential for seed dispersal, it is often cultivated in gardens and naturalized areas."
