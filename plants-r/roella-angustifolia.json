    "intro": "Roella angustifolia, commonly known as narrow-leaf roella, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and pod-like fruits. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its small, pea-like flowers are usually pink or purple, and it produces small, cylindrical pods that contain seeds. Roella angustifolia is often found in coastal regions and is used in some traditional Aboriginal practices."
