    "intro": "Rosa montana subvar. subsimplex, commonly known as the simple-flowered mountain rose, is a compact shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features dark green, oval leaves with a slightly hairy texture and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink to white. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a hardy addition to gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its delicate foliage and persistent, colorful hips that appear in autumn."
