    "intro": "Ranunculus paludosus var. confertus, commonly known as the marsh buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It features bright yellow flowers with five to eight petals, typically blooming from May to July. The plant has alternate, palmately lobed leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in marshes, fens, and along the edges of ponds. Due to its preference for wet environments, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting aquatic ecosystems."
