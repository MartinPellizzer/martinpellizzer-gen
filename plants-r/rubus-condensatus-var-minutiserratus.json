    "intro": "Rubus condensatus var. minutiserratus, commonly known as the dwarf trailing raspberry, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, prostrate stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red when mature, containing several drupelets. Its leaves are trifoliate, with finely serrated margins that give it its scientific name. It thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found in cloud forests or rocky habitats."
