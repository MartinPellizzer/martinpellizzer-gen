    "intro": "Rosa querceticola, commonly known as the oak-leaf rose, is a rare and unique species native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its distinctive foliage, which features leaves resembling those of the oak tree, with lobed edges and a rough texture. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in the spring. Its botanical significance lies in its hybrid origin, as it is a natural cross between Rosa rugosa and Rosa setigera. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Rosa querceticola is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
