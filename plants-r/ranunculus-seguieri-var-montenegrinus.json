It features delicate, palmately divided leaves and showy, yellow flowers with prominent black veins. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. It is characterized by its short, sturdy stems and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
