    "intro": "Rorippa microcapsa, commonly known as the small bladderwort, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called pneumatocysts, which help in gas exchange and buoyancy. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds, ditches, and wet meadows. Its leaves are usually submerged, while the stems and flowers may emerge above the water surface. Rorippa microcapsa plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small invertebrates."
