    "intro": "Rhododendron \u00d7 albicans, commonly known as the white rhododendron, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Rhododendron maximum and Rhododendron caucasicum. It is characterized by its large, showy white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows as an evergreen shrub, reaching heights of up to 6 meters, with dense, leathery foliage. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its botanical features make it both ornamental and ecologically significant in native habitats."
