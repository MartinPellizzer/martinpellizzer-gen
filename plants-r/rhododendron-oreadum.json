    "intro": "Rhododendron oreadum, commonly known as the mountain rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Asia, particularly in China, Japan, and Korea. It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its dense, leathery leaves and clusters of bell-shaped, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant thrives in cool, moist, acidic soils and is often found in forest understories at high elevations. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Rhododendron oreadum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable growing conditions."
