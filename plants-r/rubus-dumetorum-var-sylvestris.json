It is characterized by its thorny stems, trifoliate leaves, and clusters of small white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces edible berries that ripen to a dark purple or black color, typically in late summer or early autumn. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, moist environments. This species is often found in woodlands, hedgerows, and disturbed areas, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife."
