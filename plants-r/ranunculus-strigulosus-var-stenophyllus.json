    "intro": "Ranunculus strigulosus var. stenophyllus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved crowfoot, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features delicate, bright yellow flowers with five to eight petals, typically arranged in a cup-like shape. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. This variety is distinguished by its narrower leaf blades compared to the typical form of Ranunculus strigulosus."
