It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes other familiar plants like buckwheat and sorrel. The plant features thick, fleshy rhizomes and lance-shaped leaves with a distinctive reddish hue on the underside. Its flowers are small and clustered in dense inflorescences, typically appearing in late spring to early summer. While not widely cultivated for food, it has been used in traditional medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory properties."
