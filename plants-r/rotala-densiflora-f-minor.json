It features small, dark green leaves that are arranged in whorls around the stem, giving it a lush, dense appearance. The plant produces tiny, white flowers that bloom in summer, adding a delicate touch to water gardens. It thrives in shallow freshwater environments and is often used in pond landscaping for its ornamental value. Its rapid growth rate makes it an effective choice for water filtration and algae control in aquatic ecosystems."
