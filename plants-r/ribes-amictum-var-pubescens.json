    "intro": "Ribes amictum var. pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent gooseberry, is a shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its hairy or pubescent stems and leaves, which give it its varietal name. The plant produces small, green berries that turn red when ripe, typically in late summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded to partially shaded environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
