    "intro": "Rumex andinus, commonly known as Andean sorrel, is a perennial herb native to the Andean region of South America. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are typically red-veined and have a sour, tangy flavor due to its high content of oxalic acid. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous regions at elevations between 2,000 and 4,000 meters. Its botanical features make it a valuable plant for both culinary and medicinal uses in traditional practices."
