    "intro": "Rorippa palustris var. clavata, commonly known as the clustered watercress, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments. It is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of tiny, white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in ponds, ditches, and marshes. Its leaves are edible and have a peppery flavor similar to other members of the Brassicaceae family. This variety is distinguished by its compact growth habit and the clustering of its flowers, which set it apart from other Rorippa species."
