    "intro": "Rubus albicomus subsp. lumnitzeri, commonly known as the white-haired blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, thorny stems and small, white-veined leaves. The plant produces aggregate fruits composed of tiny, red drupes that ripen in the fall. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
