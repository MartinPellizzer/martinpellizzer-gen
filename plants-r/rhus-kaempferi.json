    "intro": "Rhus kaempferi, commonly known as Japanese lacquer tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Japan. It belongs to the Anacardiaceae family, which includes plants known for their toxic sap and aromatic properties. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often divided into three to five leaflets, and its small, yellowish-green flowers. It produces small, round fruits that are typically covered in a sticky, resinous substance. This resin has been historically used in traditional lacquer-making processes."
