    "intro": "Ranunculus aquatilis var. lalondei, commonly known as the aquatic buttercup, is a variant of the water crowfoot plant native to freshwater habitats in Europe. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers with five petals and a hairy, broad leaf structure adapted for aquatic environments. The plant typically grows in shallow water, such as ponds and streams, and thrives in nutrient-rich substrates. Its leaves are submerged or floating, while its flowers rise above the water surface. This variety is often found in still or slow-moving waters and plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates."
