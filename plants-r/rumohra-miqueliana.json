    "intro": "Rumohra miqueliana, commonly known as the Miquel's sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to the Andean region of South America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as cloud forests and rocky slopes. It produces small, clustered flowers that are often inconspicuous, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
