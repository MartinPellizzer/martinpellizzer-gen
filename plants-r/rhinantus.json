    "intro": "Rhinantus, commonly known as the false hellebore, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Ranunculaceae. It consists of several species, primarily found in southern Africa, characterized by their striking, often colorful flowers. The plants typically have palmately lobed leaves and produce showy, cup-shaped blooms in shades of yellow, orange, and red. Rhinantus species are often cultivated for their ornamental value in gardens due to their unique appearance. However, they contain toxic compounds and should be handled with care."
