    "intro": "Rigiolepis endertii, commonly known as the Endert's spurge, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a low-growing perennial that typically reaches heights of about 10 to 20 centimeters. The plant features succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. Its small, yellow flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences and bloom in the spring. Rigiolepis endertii is adapted to well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy species suitable for xeriscaping."
