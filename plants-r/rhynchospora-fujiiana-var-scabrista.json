    "intro": "Rhynchospora fujiiana var. scabrista, commonly known as the scabrous tussock sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in dense clusters. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense tussocks. The variety scabrista is distinguished by its rough, scabrous texture on the leaf surfaces, contributing to its unique botanical appearance."
