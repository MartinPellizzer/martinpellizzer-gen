    "intro": "Rhododendron nudiflorum var. coccineum, commonly known as the scarlet winter rhododendron, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its striking red or pink flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring, often before the leaves appear. The plant has lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stems. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to add color to gardens during the colder months."
