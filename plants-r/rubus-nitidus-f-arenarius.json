    "intro": "Rubus nitidus f. arenarius, commonly known as the sand raspberry. This variant of the common bramble is characterized by its smaller, more compact growth habit and hairy leaves. It produces small, red berries that are typically less flavorful compared to the main species. The plant thrives in sandy or well-drained soils, often found in coastal or inland dune environments. It is a low-growing shrub that plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for small wildlife."
