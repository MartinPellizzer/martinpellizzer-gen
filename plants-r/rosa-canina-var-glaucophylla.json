    "intro": "Rosa canina var. glaucophylla, commonly known as the whitish-leaf dog rose, is a variant of the dog rose species. It is characterized by its pale green to white undersides on its leaves, which distinguish it from the typical red-veined leaves of Rosa canina. This plant is a shrub that produces fragrant pink or white flowers in early summer. The fruits, known as hips, are typically red and contain a high concentration of vitamin C. It is native to parts of Europe and is often found in woodland edges and hedgerows."
