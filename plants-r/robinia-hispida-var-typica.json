    "intro": "Robinia hispida var. typica, commonly known as the hispid locust, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are covered in fine, stiff hairs, giving it a rough texture. The plant produces yellow, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, and it blooms with clusters of small, fragrant flowers in the spring. It is adapted to well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or disturbed areas. The species is known for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions."
