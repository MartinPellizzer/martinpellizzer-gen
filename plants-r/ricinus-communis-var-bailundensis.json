    "intro": "Ricinus communis var. bailundensis, commonly known as the African castor oil plant, is a variant of the castor oil plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves and distinctive spiny calyx that encloses its unique, spiky flower structure. The plant produces seeds that contain high levels of ricin, a toxic protein, making it both valuable and hazardous. It thrives in warm climates with well-drained soil and requires full sun for optimal growth. This variant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and historical use in producing castor oil."
