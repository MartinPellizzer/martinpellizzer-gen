    "intro": "Rhamnus alaternus prostrata, commonly known as creeping buckthorn, is a low-growing shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features small, dark green leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and have a leathery texture. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by small, black berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or disturbed habitats. Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural or natural settings."
