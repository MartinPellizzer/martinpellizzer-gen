    "intro": "Rubus abieticollinus, commonly known as the alpine blackberry, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Asia, particularly in China and the Himalayas. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and dark green, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black in color, which are edible and have a tart flavor. It thrives in cool, moist environments at high altitudes, often growing in rocky or alpine soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
