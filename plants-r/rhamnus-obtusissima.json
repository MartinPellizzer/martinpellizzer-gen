    "intro": "Rhamnus obtusissima, commonly known as the bluntleaf buckthorn, is a shrub native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its small, oval leaves that are typically leathery and have a smooth texture. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by black, berry-like fruits that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions and is often found in woodland or chaparral habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological role, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and natural landscapes."
