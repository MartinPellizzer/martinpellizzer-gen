    "intro": "Rubus arenosus, commonly known as the sand raspberry, is a species of bramble native to arid and semi-arid regions of Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its prickly stems and small, pale pink to red flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant produces small, edible berries that are typically sour but can be used in jams or wines. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal areas and dry grasslands. Due to its hardy nature, it is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions."
