    "intro": "Ramonda, commonly known as the mountain sorrel, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Geraniaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. These plants typically have basal leaves that are heart-shaped or kidney-shaped, often with a hairy surface. The flowers are usually small, clustered in umbels, and come in shades of pink or white. Ramonda species are often found in rocky or alpine environments, where they thrive in well-drained soils."
