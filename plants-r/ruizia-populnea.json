    "intro": "Ruizia populnea, commonly known as the silky tree, is a deciduous tree native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and large, palmately lobed leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky down. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters. Its fruits are woody capsules that split open to release seeds. Ruizia populnea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
