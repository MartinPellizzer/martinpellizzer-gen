    "intro": "Rhinanthus pumilus subsp. pumilus, commonly known as the dwarf yellow-rattle, is a small annual herbaceous plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially depends on host plants for nutrients through its root system. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as grasslands and heaths. Its distribution is largely limited to the British Isles, where it is considered a rare and locally uncommon species."
