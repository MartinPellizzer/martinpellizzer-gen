    "intro": "Rumex tauricus, commonly known as the Tauric sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Caucasus region. It features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive reddish or purple coloration on the underside, which is a characteristic feature of the Rumex genus. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and streambanks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats."
