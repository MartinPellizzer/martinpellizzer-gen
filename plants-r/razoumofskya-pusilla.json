    "intro": "Razoumofskya pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf razoumofskya, is a small, flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, umbellate inflorescence. The plant typically grows to a height of only a few centimeters, with finely divided, fern-like leaves. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its rarity and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
