    "intro": "Rhinanthus \u00d7 digeneus, commonly known as the hybrid yellow rattle, is a flowering plant that belongs to the Orobanchaceae family. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients while performing photosynthesis. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. It is often found in grassland habitats, particularly in areas with a mix of grasses and herbs. Its presence can influence the structure of plant communities by reducing the dominance of certain grass species."
