    "intro": "Rubus glaucovirens var. bresiensis, commonly known as the Bresien\u2019s raspberry, is a variant of the glaucovirens raspberry species. It is a deciduous shrub belonging to the Rosaceae family, characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red when mature, though they may vary in color depending on the variety. It is native to specific regions in Europe and is often found in woodland edges and rocky soils. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species in its native habitat."
