    "intro": "Rhagadiolus echinatus, commonly known as the spiny rock orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to specific regions in southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive spiny leaves and compact, clustered growth habit. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually greenish or brownish in color, which helps it blend into its natural surroundings. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
