    "intro": "Rosularia, commonly known as the stonecrop, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Crassulaceae. These plants are characterized by their fleshy, succulent leaves that are often arranged in a rosette formation. Rosularia species are native to temperate and arid regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including Europe, Asia, and North America. They typically produce small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple during the summer months. Due to their drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements, many species are popular in rock gardens and xeriscaping."
