    "intro": "Rhamnus serrata var. scopulorum, commonly known as the coastal buckthorn, is a shrub native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, dark green leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by red or orange berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with high salt exposure. This variety is often used in coastal stabilization due to its hardy nature and ability to prevent erosion."
