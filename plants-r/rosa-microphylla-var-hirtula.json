    "intro": "Rosa microphylla var. hirtula, commonly known as the woolly evergreen rose, is a compact shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, leathery leaves that are densely covered in fine, white hairs, giving them a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces fragrant, single or semi-double flowers in shades of pink and white, typically blooming in spring. Its evergreen nature makes it a hardy ornamental plant suitable for coastal gardens. The hairy foliage provides a unique texture and helps it retain moisture in dry conditions."
