    "intro": "Rosa rhaetica, commonly known as the Rhaetian rose, is a rare and ancient species native to the Alps. It is characterized by its pale pink to white flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant has a shrub-like growth habit with thorny stems and dark green, serrated leaves. It thrives in high-altitude environments with well-drained soil and full sun exposure. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
