    "intro": "Rottboellia hamiltonii, commonly known as the hairy panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, hairy leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. The plant produces small, greenish or brownish spikelets that are arranged in dense clusters along the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. Rottboellia hamiltonii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
