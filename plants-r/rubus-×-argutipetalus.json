    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 argutipetalus, commonly known as the prickly blackberry, is a hybrid plant within the Rubus genus, characterized by its thorny stems and aggregate fruits. It typically grows in temperate regions and is known for its edible, dark purple to black berries. The plant has palmate leaves with serrated edges and produces white or pale pink flowers in the spring. It is often found in woodlands, thickets, and along streambanks. Its hybrid origin contributes to its variability in morphology and fruit characteristics."
