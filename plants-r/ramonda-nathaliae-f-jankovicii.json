    "intro": "Ramonda nathaliae f. jankovicii, commonly known as the Jankovi\u0107's ramonda, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage and showy, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist woodland habitats, preferring well-drained, acidic soils. Its floral structure consists of five petals, and it is pollinated primarily by bees and other small insects. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
