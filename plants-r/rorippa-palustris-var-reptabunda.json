    "intro": "Rorippa palustris var. reptabunda, commonly known as the water bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant native to wetlands and shallow water bodies. It is characterized by its floating leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is typically found in temperate regions and thrives in still or slow-moving water. Its leaves are often inflated, resembling small bladders, which help it float. It plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small invertebrates."
