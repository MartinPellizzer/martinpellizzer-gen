    "intro": "Rumex pallidus subsp. subarcticus, commonly known as the subarctic dock, is a perennial herb native to Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in cold, dry environments. The plant produces small, clustered greenish flowers that are typically arranged in a cup-like structure called a scorpioid cyme. It thrives in rocky, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in tundra and alpine habitats. Its morphology is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and short growing seasons."
