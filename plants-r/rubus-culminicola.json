    "intro": "Rubus culminicola, commonly known as the alpine raspberry, is a species of bramble native to high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its erect growth habit and produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or orange in color. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh climates. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have serrated edges, while its stems are armed with stiff, curved prickles. Due to its restricted habitat, Rubus culminicola is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
