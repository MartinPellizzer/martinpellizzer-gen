    "intro": "Rubus almensis, commonly known as the Almen's bramble, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is a shrub characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, white or pink flowers. The plant produces edible berries that are typically red or black in color, though they are often tart and less commonly consumed than other Rubus species. Native to certain regions of Asia, it thrives in temperate climates and moist, well-drained soils. Its botanical features make it an important plant in both ecological and horticultural contexts."
