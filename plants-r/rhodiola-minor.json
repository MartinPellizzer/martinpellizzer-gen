    "intro": "Rhodiola minor, commonly known as the lesser rhodiola, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Crassulaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, succulent leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, where it tolerates cold and harsh environmental conditions. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to store water and nutrients efficiently. Rhodiola minor is also known for its adaptogenic properties, making it a subject of interest in traditional medicine."
