It is characterized by its dark green, almost black foliage that contrasts with its fragrant, pale pink to white flowers. The plant produces rose hips that are typically red or orange, containing the seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in herbal medicine."
