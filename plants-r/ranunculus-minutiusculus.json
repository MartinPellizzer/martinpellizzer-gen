    "intro": "Ranunculus minutiusculus, commonly known as the minute buttercup, is a small, herbaceous perennial native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges. The plant features delicate, trifoliate leaves and small, yellow flowers with five petals. Its flowers bloom in early spring, and it is known for its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes. Due to its small size and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
