    "intro": "Romulea camerooniana, commonly known as the Cameroon glory-of-the-snow, is a bulbous perennial plant native to Cameroon. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its striking, star-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces a cluster of narrow, grass-like leaves and has a corm-like bulb that stores nutrients. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it remains relatively rare in horticultural trade."
