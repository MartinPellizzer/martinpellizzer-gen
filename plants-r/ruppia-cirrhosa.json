    "intro": "Ruppia cirrhosa, commonly known as sea rocket, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions. It thrives in brackish and saline waters, often found in estuaries and intertidal zones. The plant has slender, branching stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in summer. Its leaves are linear and adapted to withstand salt spray and tidal action. Ruppia cirrhosa plays a role in stabilizing coastal sediments and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
