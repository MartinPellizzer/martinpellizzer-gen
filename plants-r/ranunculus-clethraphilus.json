    "intro": "Ranunculus clethraphilus, commonly known as the clethra leaf buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features delicate, yellow flowers with five petals and numerous stamens, typical of the Ranunculaceae family. The plant has palmately lobed leaves that are often mistaken for those of clethra species, leading to its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its botanical significance lies in its unique leaf morphology and its role in supporting local pollinators."
