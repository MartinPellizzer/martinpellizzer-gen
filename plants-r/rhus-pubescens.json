    "intro": "Rhus pubescens, commonly known as staghorn sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and covered in fine, rusty-colored hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by bright red, berry-like fruits in the fall. Its bark is thick and rugged, with a rough, fissured texture that gives it its common name. Rhus pubescens is often found in moist, disturbed soils along streambanks and in open woodlands."
