    "intro": "Rebutia spegazziniana var. atroviridis, commonly known as the dark green rebutia, is a compact, low-growing cactus native to South America. It features rounded, ribbed stems that are typically a dark green color, often with a bluish or grayish tinge. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It is well-suited for rock gardens and requires well-draining soil and full sun exposure. Due to its drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and succulent collections."
