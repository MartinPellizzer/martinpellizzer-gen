    "intro": "Rosmarinus flexuosus, commonly known as creeping rosemary, is a low-growing shrub native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It features aromatic, needle-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color, with a strong, pine-like scent. The plant produces small, pale blue or white flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Rosmarinus flexuosus is valued for its ornamental appeal and medicinal properties, similar to other members of the rosemary genus."
