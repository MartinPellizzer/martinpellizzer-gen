    "intro": "Rosa myrsinites, commonly known as the evergreen rose, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is native to the western United States and is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and showy pink to red flowers. The plant is evergreen, meaning it retains its leaves throughout the year, which is a distinguishing feature. It typically grows in rocky or well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas. The flowers bloom in spring and are followed by small, red, hairy fruits known as achenes."
