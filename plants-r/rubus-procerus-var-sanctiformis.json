    "intro": "Rubus procerus var. sanctiformis, commonly known as the San Francisco raspberry, is a rare and endemic species native to the coastal regions of California. It is a shrub characterized by its trailing stems and dense clusters of small, dark red berries. The plant features compound leaves with serrated margins and produces white flowers with five petals. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to the mild, coastal climate. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
