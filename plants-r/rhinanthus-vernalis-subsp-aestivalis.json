    "intro": "Rhinanthus vernalis subsp. aestivalis, commonly known as the summer common tickseed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on other plants for nutrients through its root system. It typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands, meadows, and woodland edges. Its flowers attract various pollinators, including bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological significance."
