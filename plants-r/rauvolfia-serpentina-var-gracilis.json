    "intro": "Rauvolfia serpentina var. gracilis, commonly known as Indian snakeroot, is a flowering plant native to the Indian subcontinent. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers that are often clustered in umbels. Its roots are valued in traditional medicine for their hypotensive properties due to the presence of alkaloids like reserpine. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forests and along stream banks."
