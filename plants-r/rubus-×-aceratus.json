    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 aceratus, commonly known as the red-berried blackberry, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Rubus ursinus (slippery elm) and Rubus chamaemorus (cloudberry). It is characterized by its thorny stems, trifoliate leaves, and small, aggregate fruits that turn red when mature. The plant thrives in temperate climates and is often found in moist, acidic soils. Its berries are edible, though they have a tart flavor and are sometimes used in jams and desserts. Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits a mix of traits from both parent species."
