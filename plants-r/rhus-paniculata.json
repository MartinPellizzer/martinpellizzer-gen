    "intro": "Rhus paniculata, commonly known as the smooth sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and turn vibrant red in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in panicles, which are followed by orange-red, fuzzy berries. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established. Rhus paniculata is often found in woodland edges, open woods, and disturbed soils."
