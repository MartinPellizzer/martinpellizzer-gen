    "intro": "Rochelia microcalycina, commonly known as the small-calyx rochelia, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, white flowers that bloom in clusters. Its roots are fibrous and often used in traditional medicine for their purported diuretic properties. Rochelia microcalycina is relatively rare and is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological niche and potential medicinal value."
