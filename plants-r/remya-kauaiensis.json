    "intro": "Remya kauaiensis, commonly known as Kauai's remya, is a rare flowering plant native to the island of Kauai in Hawaii. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its small, fragrant white flowers that bloom during the summer months. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and rocky areas. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and often have a waxy texture, which helps it retain moisture in its native habitat. Due to habitat loss and introduced species, Remya kauaiensis is considered endangered and is protected under Hawaiian conservation laws."
