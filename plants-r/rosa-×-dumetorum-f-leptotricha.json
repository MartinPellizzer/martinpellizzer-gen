    "intro": "Rosa \u00d7 dumetorum f. leptotricha, commonly known as the creeping rose or dog rose, is a hybrid shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with thornless stems that often form dense mats. The plant produces small, fragrant pink or white flowers that bloom in spring. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the fruits are red, hairy rosehips that mature in autumn. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used historically in herbal medicine."
