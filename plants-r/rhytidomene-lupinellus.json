    "intro": "Rhytidomene lupinellus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lupin, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and compound leaves that are typically narrow and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers in shades of pink or purple, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Rhytidomene lupinellus is native to Australia and thrives in sandy or well-drained soils. It is often found in open woodlands and along coastal areas, where it plays a role in soil nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria."
