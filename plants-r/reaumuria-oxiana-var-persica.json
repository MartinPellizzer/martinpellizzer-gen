    "intro": "Reaumuria oxiana var. persica, commonly known as Persian sandthorn, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and thorny stems, which are adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It produces small, red or orange fruits that are edible and used in traditional medicine. This species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils."
