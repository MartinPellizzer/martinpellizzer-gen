    "intro": "Rosa tomentella var. eglandulosa, commonly known as the woolly rose or glandular woolly rose, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its dense, woolly gray foliage and thorny stems, which provide structural support and protection. The plant produces fragrant, pink to white flowers in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with a hairy surface, and the plant is well adapted to rocky and well-drained soils. Rosa tomentella var. eglandulosa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and hardy nature in garden settings."
