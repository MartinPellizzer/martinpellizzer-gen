    "intro": "Rheum scaberrimum, commonly known as the rough rhubarb, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features tall, fibrous stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often with a reddish or purplish tinge. The plant produces large, palmately lobed leaves that are covered in stiff, bristly hairs, giving it a rough texture. Its flowers are clustered in panicles and consist of both male and female parts, typical of the Polygonaceae family. The roots of Rheum scaberrimum are thick and fleshy, containing high levels of anthraquinone compounds, which have been used in traditional medicine."
