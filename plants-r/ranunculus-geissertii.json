    "intro": "Ranunculus geissertii, commonly known as the Geissert's buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features showy, yellow flowers with five to seven petals, typically arranged in a cup-like shape. The plant has palmately divided leaves that are deeply lobed and covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
