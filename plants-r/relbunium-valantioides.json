    "intro": "Relbunium valantioides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved relbunium, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is native to parts of southern Europe and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, compound leaves. The plant produces umbel-like clusters of white or pale yellow flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky or dry soils and is often found in open woodlands or grassy slopes. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
