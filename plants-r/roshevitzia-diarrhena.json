It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads and typically showy blooms. The plant features narrow, linear leaves and produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in dense, disc-like structures. Roshevitzia diarrhena is adapted to arid environments, with deep roots that help it survive in dry conditions. It is often found in rocky soils and is considered a valuable plant for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
