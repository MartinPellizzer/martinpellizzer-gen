It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and produces small, edible red berries. The plant features compound leaves with serrated edges and produces white to pale pink flowers in the spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
