    "intro": "Ricinus communis f. atrofulvatus, commonly known as the black-hairy castor plant, is a unique variant of the castor oil plant. It is characterized by its dark, velvety foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are typically larger and more densely hairy compared to the standard castor plant. This form is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its striking visual appeal. It retains the same basic growth habits as the common castor plant, including its ability to produce toxic seeds."
