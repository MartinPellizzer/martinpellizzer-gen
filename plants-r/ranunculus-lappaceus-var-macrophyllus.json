    "intro": "Ranunculus lappaceus var. macrophyllus, commonly known as the broadleaf water crowfoot, is a perennial aquatic plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often submerged or floating on the water's surface. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers with five petals, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. Its leaves and stems are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its aquatic environment."
