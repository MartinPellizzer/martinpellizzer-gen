    "intro": "Ranunculus pozoifolius, commonly known as the Pozoifolius buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of South America. It features delicate, showy flowers with five to eight petals, typically in shades of yellow or white, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. It is often found in rocky or alpine environments, where it contributes to the biodiversity of its ecosystem. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
