    "intro": "Rubus leucocarpus, commonly known as the white-fruited blackberry, is a species of brambles native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that develop into the distinctive white or pale-colored berries. These berries are not typically eaten by humans but are an important food source for wildlife. The plant thrives in moist, wooded areas and is often found in the understory of forests."
