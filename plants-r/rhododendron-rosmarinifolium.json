    "intro": "Rhododendron rosmarinifolium, commonly known as the marjoram-leaved rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage that resembles the leaves of marjoram, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows as a shrub, reaching heights of up to 3 meters, with thick, leathery leaves that are dark green and aromatic. Its flowers are clustered in trusses and bloom in shades of pink to purple, often in late spring to early summer. This plant prefers acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas with high humidity."
