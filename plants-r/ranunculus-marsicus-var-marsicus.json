    "intro": "Ranunculus marsicus var. marsicus, commonly known as the Marsic Alps buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the alpine regions of the Eastern Alps. It features delicate, cup-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or white, with 5 to 15 petals. The plant has smooth, hairy, or glandular leaves that are usually trifoliate or palmately divided. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to its high-altitude environment, including compact growth and frost resistance."
