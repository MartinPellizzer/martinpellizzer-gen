It is characterized by its small, oval leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are followed by dark, egg-shaped berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to withstand harsh conditions."
