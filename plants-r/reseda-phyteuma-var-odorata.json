    "intro": "Reseda phyteuma var. odorata, commonly known as sweet rocket, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and clusters of small, fragrant, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly rough texture. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or borders. Its pleasant scent attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological value."
