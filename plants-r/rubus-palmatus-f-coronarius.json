    "intro": "Rubus palmatus f. coronarius, commonly known as the crown raspberry, is a variant of the common raspberry that exhibits distinctive botanical features. It is characterized by its erect growth habit and dense, thorny stems that often form a bushy structure. The leaves are typically palmately compound, with five to seven leaflets that are serrated and have a slightly hairy texture. Its flowers are small, white, and clustered in rounded inflorescences, giving it a crown-like appearance. The fruit, a red, hairy aggregate berry, matures in late summer and is often used in local culinary traditions."
