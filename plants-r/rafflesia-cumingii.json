    "intro": "Rafflesia cumingii, commonly known as the Cuming's corpse flower, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Rafflesiaceae family. It is notable for producing the world's largest individual flower, which can reach up to 1 meter in diameter. The plant lacks leaves, stems, and roots, relying entirely on its host, typically a Tetrastigma vine, for nutrients. Its flowers emit a strong, foul odor resembling decaying flesh, which attracts flies and carrion beetles as pollinators. The plant is found in the rainforests of Borneo and is considered a rare and endangered species due to habitat loss."
