    "intro": "Rubus hebecaulis var. hirsutisepalus, commonly known as the hairy-stalked bramble, is a variant of the bramble genus Rubus. It is characterized by its hairy stems and foliage, which provide it with a distinctive appearance. The plant is native to certain regions of Europe and is often found in woodland edges and shrublands. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, and it produces edible berries, though they are generally less palatable than those of other Rubus species. This variant is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
