    "intro": "Rosa canina var. gracilenta, commonly known as the slender dog rose, is a botanical variant of the common dog rose. It is characterized by its slender, often climbing stems and smaller, fragrant flowers compared to the typical Rosa canina. The plant produces red or orange hips, which are rich in vitamin C and used in traditional medicine. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in hedgerows and woodland edges. Its morphology and habitat make it a distinctive and valuable species in ecological and horticultural contexts."
