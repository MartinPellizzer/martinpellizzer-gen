    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus var. envalirensis, commonly known as the golden buttercup, is a variant of the broad-leaved buttercup native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its bright yellow, cup-shaped flowers and palmately lobed leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and thrives in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. It is a herbaceous perennial that produces numerous small, showy flowers from late spring to early summer. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain environments."
