    "intro": "Ranunculus lappaceus, commonly known as the alpine buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It features delicate, yellow flowers with numerous petals and a hairy, glandular stem that helps it withstand cold and arid conditions. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils. Its leaves are palmately lobed and often covered in fine hairs, which aid in reducing water loss. Ranunculus lappaceus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
