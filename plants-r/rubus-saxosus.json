    "intro": "Rubus saxosus, commonly known as the saxifrage raspberry, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and small, aggregate fruits that resemble raspberries. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it produces white or pale pink flowers in early summer. Rubus saxosus is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported health benefits."
