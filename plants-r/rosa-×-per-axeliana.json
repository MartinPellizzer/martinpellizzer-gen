    "intro": "Rosa \u00d7 per-axeliana, commonly known as the Per Axeliana rose, is a hybrid rose species resulting from the cross between Rosa damascena and Rosa centifolia. It is characterized by its vigorous growth habit and abundant, fragrant blooms that typically appear in shades of pink to white. The plant features dark green, serrated leaves and thorny stems, typical of many rose species. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and for its use in perfumery due to its strong, sweet fragrance.
