    "intro": "Rhododendron exasperatum, commonly known as the Japanese rhododendron, is a deciduous shrub native to Japan and Korea. It features showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to red, typically blooming in late spring. The plant has dark green, leathery leaves that are elliptical in shape and arranged in whorls around the stems. It prefers acidic, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is complemented by its ability to thrive in cooler climates."
