    "intro": "Rubus muenteri proles minianus, commonly known as the Minianus blackberry, is a species of brambles native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and produces small, dark berries that are typically harvested in the fall. The plant features trifoliate leaves with serrated edges and thorny stems, typical of the Rubus genus. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
