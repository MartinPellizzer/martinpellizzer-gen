    "intro": "Rudolfiella sabulosa, commonly known as the sand lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the sandy soils of the western United States. It typically grows to a height of about 10 to 20 centimeters, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers with six petals, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open habitats such as dunes or rocky areas. Rudolfiella sabulosa is adapted to arid environments and has a deep root system to access moisture."
