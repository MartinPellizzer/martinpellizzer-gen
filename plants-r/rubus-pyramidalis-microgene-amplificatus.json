    "intro": "Rubus pyramidalis microgene amplificatus, commonly known as the pyramidal raspberry, is a rare and specialized plant species characterized by its unique genetic makeup. It exhibits distinct botanical features, including compound leaves with serrated edges and small, aggregate fruits that develop from multiple ovaries. The plant thrives in temperate climates, often in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, with five petals and numerous stamens, contributing to its ornamental value. Due to its genetic complexity, it is of interest to botanists and geneticists studying plant evolution and adaptation."
