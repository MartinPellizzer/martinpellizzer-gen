    "intro": "Rhododendron nanophyton var. petrophilum, commonly known as the rock rhododendron, is a rare and compact shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves and clusters of bell-shaped, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is typically found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific environmental requirements, it is considered endangered and is often cultivated in botanical gardens. Its unique morphology and ecological niche make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists alike."
