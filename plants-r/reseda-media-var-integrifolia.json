    "intro": "Reseda media var. integrifolia, commonly known as the smooth everlasting pea, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pea-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The leaves are entire, meaning they have no serrations, and are arranged alternately along the stem. This plant is often found in dry grasslands and rocky soils, thriving in full sun. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used historically in herbal medicine."
