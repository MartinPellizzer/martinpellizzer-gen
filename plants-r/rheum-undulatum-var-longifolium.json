    "intro": "Rheum undulatum var. longifolium, commonly known as the long-leaved rhubarb, is a variant of the rhubarb plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers in spring, which are followed by elongated, reddish berries. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine. Its leaves, while edible, contain oxalic acid and should be cooked before consumption."
