It is characterized by its erect or spreading growth habit and produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or black in color. The plant has compound leaves with serrated margins and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude climates. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological adaptations and limited distribution."
