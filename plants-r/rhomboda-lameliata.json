    "intro": "Rhomboda lameliata, commonly known as the velvetleaf or rhombodan, is a tropical plant native to parts of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are typically velvety to the touch, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or yellow in color. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Rhomboda lameliata is often found in wetland areas and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
