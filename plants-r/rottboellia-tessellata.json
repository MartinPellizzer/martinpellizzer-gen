    "intro": "Rottboellia tessellata, commonly known as the African carpet grass, is a perennial grass native to Africa, Asia, and Australia. It features slender, wiry stems and small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences, which bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, forming dense mats that can dominate disturbed soils. Botanically, it is characterized by its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its tolerance to drought and poor nutrient conditions."
