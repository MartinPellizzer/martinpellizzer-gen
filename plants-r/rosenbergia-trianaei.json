    "intro": "Rosenbergia trianaei, commonly known as the Triana's rosenbergia, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its compact, epiphytic growth habit. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, often with intricate patterns on the petals. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a valuable species in botanical conservation efforts."
