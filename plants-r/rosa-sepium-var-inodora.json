The plant is characterized by its simple, often red or pink flowers that lack the strong fragrance typical of many rose varieties. Its leaves are typically pinnately compound, with serrated margins. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant blooms and hardy nature."
