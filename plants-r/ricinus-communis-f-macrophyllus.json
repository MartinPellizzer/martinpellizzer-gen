    "intro": "Ricinus communis f. macrophyllus, commonly known as the giant castor plant, is a variant of the castor oil plant characterized by its large, palmate leaves. This cultivar exhibits elongated, broad leaf blades that can reach up to 30 cm in length, giving it a striking appearance. The leaves are usually a deep green with a smooth, waxy texture and may have a slightly hairy underside. It produces spiny, capsule-like fruits containing toxic seeds, similar to the parent species. The plant is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its dramatic foliage."
