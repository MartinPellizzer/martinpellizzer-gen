    "intro": "Rosa canina var. lejeunei, commonly known as the Turkish rose or Turkish dog rose, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers. The plant produces small, red, hairy fruits known as hips, which are rich in vitamin C. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or dry habitats. This variety is closely related to the common dog rose, Rosa canina, but exhibits distinct morphological features."
