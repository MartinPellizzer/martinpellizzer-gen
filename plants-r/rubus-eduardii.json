    "intro": "Rubus eduardii, commonly known as Edward's blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically harvested in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or forested areas. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
