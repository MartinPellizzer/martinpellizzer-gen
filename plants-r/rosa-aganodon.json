    "intro": "Rosa aganodon, commonly known as the evergreen rose, is a shrub native to the Canary Islands. It features dense, leathery leaves that remain green throughout the year, contributing to its evergreen nature. The plant produces fragrant, single or double flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, typically blooming in spring and summer. Its stems are covered in thorns, and it is well adapted to coastal and rocky environments. Rosa aganodon is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in mild climates."
