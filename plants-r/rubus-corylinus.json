    "intro": "Rubus corylinus, commonly known as the blackberry cane or red raspberry, is a species of bramble native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its prickly stems and compound leaves, which are typical of the Rubus genus. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that ripen to a deep red or black color, depending on the variety. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, loamy soils. Rubus corylinus is often found in woodland edges, thickets, and disturbed areas, where it plays a role in supporting local wildlife."
