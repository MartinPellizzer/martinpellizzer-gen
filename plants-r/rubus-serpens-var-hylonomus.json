    "intro": "Rubus serpens var. hylonomus, commonly known as the Hylonomus blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to North America. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and thorny stems, which help it to climb and spread across various habitats. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically consumed by wildlife and birds. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. This variety is often found in woodland areas and along stream banks, where it plays a role in soil stabilization and ecosystem diversity."
