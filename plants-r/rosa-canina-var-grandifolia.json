    "intro": "Rosa canina var. grandifolia, commonly known as the large-flowered dog rose, is a variant of the dog rose species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its larger, more showy flowers compared to the typical Rosa canina, with petals that can reach up to 5 cm in diameter. The plant produces red-orange hips, which are rich in vitamin C and used in traditional medicine. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often growing as a shrub or small tree. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens, while its ecological importance supports pollinators and wildlife."
