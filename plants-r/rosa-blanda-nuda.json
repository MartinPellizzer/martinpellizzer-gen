    "intro": "Rosa blanda nuda, commonly known as the slender wild rose, is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features slender, arching stems that produce clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white to pale pink. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are typically oval to ovate in shape with a slightly toothed margin. It thrives in partial to full shade and moist, well-drained soils, making it a suitable choice for woodland gardens. The flowers bloom in late spring to early summer and are often followed by small, red-orange hips that persist into the fall."
