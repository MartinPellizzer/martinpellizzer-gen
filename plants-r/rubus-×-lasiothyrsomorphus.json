It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Rubus ursinus (the blackberry) and Rubus lasiothyrsus (the bramble). The plant is characterized by its thorny stems, compound leaves, and aggregate fruits that develop from multiple ovaries. It is typically found in temperate regions and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its adaptability and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated for landscaping purposes."
