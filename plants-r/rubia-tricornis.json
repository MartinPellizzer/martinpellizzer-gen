    "intro": "Rubia tricornis, commonly known as the three-angled knotweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family, which includes over 12,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are divided into three leaflets, and its small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. Rubia tricornis typically grows in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and stream banks. It has been used traditionally in herbal medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties."
