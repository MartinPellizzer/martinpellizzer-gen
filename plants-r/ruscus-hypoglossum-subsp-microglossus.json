    "intro": "Ruscus hypoglossum subsp. microglossus, commonly known as the narrow-leafed butcher's broom, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features dense clusters of small, scale-like leaves that form a tight rosette at the base of the plant. The plant produces bright red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its unique appearance and ornamental value make it a popular choice for rock gardens and as a decorative plant in shaded areas."
