    "intro": "Ramischia secunda f. angustata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed form of the species, is a perennial herb native to specific regions of southern Africa. It features slender, angular stems that are often hairy, and its leaves are narrow, elongated, and slightly pointed. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pale green to yellowish in color, blooming during the cooler months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized plant within its native range."
