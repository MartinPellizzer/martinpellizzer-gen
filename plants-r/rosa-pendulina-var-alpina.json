    "intro": "Rosa pendulina var. alpina, commonly known as the alpine trailing rose, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, arching stems that often trail along the ground, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and covered in fine hairs, adapted to withstand cold and harsh alpine conditions. Rosa pendulina var. alpina is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils."
