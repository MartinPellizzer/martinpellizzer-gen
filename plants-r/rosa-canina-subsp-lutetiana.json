    "intro": "Rosa canina subsp. lutetiana, commonly known as the French rose or the dog rose, is a shrub native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems, pinnate leaves, and clusters of pink to red flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces bright orange to red hips, which are rich in vitamin C and used in traditional medicine and culinary applications. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in hedgerows, woodlands, and along riverbanks. This subspecies is closely related to the common dog rose, Rosa canina, but differs in its floral structure and habitat preferences."
