    "intro": "Rhabdia aquatica, commonly known as the water bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant native to freshwater environments. It is characterized by its floating leaves and specialized structures called bladders, which are used for capturing small aquatic organisms. The plant is often found in ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. Its growth is typically submerged, with leaves that are broad and rounded. Rhabdia aquatica plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and contributing to nutrient cycling."
