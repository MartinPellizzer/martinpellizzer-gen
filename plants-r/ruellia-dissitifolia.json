    "intro": "Ruellia dissitifolia, commonly known as the velvetleaf ruellia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The leaves are typically opposite, ovate, and covered in fine, short hairs, giving them a velvety texture. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or shaded areas. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
