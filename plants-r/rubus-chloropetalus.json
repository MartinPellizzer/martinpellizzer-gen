    "intro": "Rubus chloropetalus, commonly known as the green-petaled raspberry, is a species of bramble native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its distinctive greenish-white flowers, which contrast with its typical red or yellow raspberry varieties. The plant produces small, edible berries that are often less flavorful than those of other Rubus species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are compound, with three to five leaflets, and the stems are armed with stiff, curved prickles."
