    "intro": "Rosa mollis f. dahlstedtii, commonly known as the Dahlstedt's rose, is a compact, shrubby plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features glossy, dark green leaves and produces fragrant, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is characterized by its dense, thornless growth habit and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within the Rosa genus."
