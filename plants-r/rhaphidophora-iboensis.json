    "intro": "Rhaphidophora iboensis, commonly known as the Ibo's arrowroot, is a tropical plant native to West Africa. It belongs to the Araceae family and is characterized by its upright, tuberous stem and broad, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white in color. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense clusters in moist, shaded environments. Rhaphidophora iboensis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a source of starchy roots."
