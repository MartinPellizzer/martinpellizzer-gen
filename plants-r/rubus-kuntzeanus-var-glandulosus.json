    "intro": "Rubus kuntzeanus var. glandulosus, commonly known as the glandular blackberry, is a species of brambles native to certain regions of South America. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated margins. The flowers are typically white or pale pink, and the fruit is a aggregate of small drupes that ripen to a dark purple or black color. This variety is notable for its glandular hairs on the stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive texture and appearance. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland or shrubland habitats."
