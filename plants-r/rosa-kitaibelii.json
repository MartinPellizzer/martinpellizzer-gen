    "intro": "Rosa kitaibelii, commonly known as the Kitaibel's rose, is a species of shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of fragrant, pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces oval, green leaves with serrated edges, and its hips, which are the fruit, are typically orange-red and contain numerous seeds. Rosa kitaibelii is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, thriving in temperate climates."
