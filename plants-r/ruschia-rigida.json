    "intro": "Ruschia rigida, commonly known as the rigid ruschia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features fleshy, ribbed stems and produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange. The plant is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy leaves. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and succulent collections."
