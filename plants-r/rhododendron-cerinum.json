    "intro": "Rhododendron cerinum, commonly known as the alpine rhododendron, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It typically grows at high elevations, where it thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often appearing in late spring. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, providing a striking contrast to the showy blooms. Rhododendron cerinum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural alpine habitat."
