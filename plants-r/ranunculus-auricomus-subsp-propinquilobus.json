    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus subsp. propinquilobus, commonly known as the Alpine buttercup, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its bright yellow, cup-shaped flowers and trifoliate leaves with serrated edges. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky habitats at high elevations. It prefers cool, moist conditions and is often found in mountainous regions with well-drained soil. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species in many areas."
