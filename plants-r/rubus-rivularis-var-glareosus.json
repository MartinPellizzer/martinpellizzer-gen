    "intro": "Rubus rivularis var. glareosus, commonly known as the shining blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark purple to black berries that are typically larger than those of the standard species. The plant produces compound leaves with serrated edges and thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is often found in riverbanks and forest understories where it spreads through its trailing stems. Its berries are not only ornamental but also have mild culinary uses in some traditional cuisines."
