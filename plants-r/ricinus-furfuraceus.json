    "intro": "Ricinus furfuraceus, commonly known as the velvetleaf castor, is a species of flowering plant in the spurge family, Euphorbiaceae. It is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves that are covered in a dense, velvety layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in cyathia, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its seeds, like those of other Ricinus species, contain toxic ricin, making them hazardous if ingested. Ricinus furfuraceus is native to tropical and subtropical regions and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and agricultural fields."
