    "intro": "Rhynchospora consanguinea var. rigida, commonly known as rigid spikegrass, is a perennial herb native to the wetlands and marshes of the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular, stiff, and often ribbed stems. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish or brownish in color, arranged in spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a waxy coating that helps it retain moisture in wet environments. Rhynchospora consanguinea var. rigida plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
