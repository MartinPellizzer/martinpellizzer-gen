    "intro": "Rosa \u00d7 dumetorum var. calvescens, commonly known as the creeping red raspberry, is a low-growing shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems that often lie close to the ground, forming mats. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by red, hairy berries. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have serrated edges, typical of many rose species. This variety is often used in hedges or as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ability to thrive in various soil conditions."
