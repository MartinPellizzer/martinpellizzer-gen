    "intro": "Rubus uncinulatus, commonly known as the hooked blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the eastern United States. It is a deciduous shrub that produces small, dark purple to black berries. The plant has prickly stems and broad, three-lobed leaves with serrated edges. Its flowers are white and clustered in umbels, typical of the Rubus genus. The fruit is often used in jams and preserves, though it is less commonly cultivated than other blackberry varieties."
