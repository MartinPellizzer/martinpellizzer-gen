    "intro": "Rosa \u00d7 pseudoflexuosa, commonly known as the everblooming rose, is a hybrid species within the Rosa genus. It is characterized by its ability to produce flowers throughout the growing season, unlike many other rose varieties that bloom only once or twice a year. The plant typically features fragrant, semi-double to double flowers in shades of pink, red, and white. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, requiring regular watering and pruning for optimal growth. Due to its continuous blooming habit, it is a popular choice for gardeners seeking long-lasting floral displays."
