It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of bell-shaped, showy flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters and prefers well-drained, acidic soils. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and is often found in moist, cool climates. The flowers, which range in color from white to pink, are a key feature in its ornamental value."
