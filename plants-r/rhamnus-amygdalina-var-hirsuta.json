    "intro": "Rhamnus amygdalina var. hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and small, oval-shaped leaves with a glossy upper surface. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by reddish-black berries that are edible but often bitter. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or rocky areas. The hairy variant distinguishes itself from other buckthorn species by its pubescent stems and leaves."
