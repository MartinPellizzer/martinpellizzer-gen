    "intro": "Rubus gressittii, commonly known as Gressitt's blackberry, is a species of brambles native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is characterized by its thorny stems, trifoliate leaves, and aggregate fruits composed of tiny drupelets. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, and it produces edible berries that are often used in culinary applications. However, due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
