    "intro": "Rumex \u00d7 hazslinszkyanus, commonly known as the hybrid sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Polygonaceae family. It is a natural hybrid between Rumex acetosa (common sorrel) and Rumex patientia (lamb's lettuce). The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are small and clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences, and it produces oval, reddish-brown seeds. This hybrid is often found in moist, disturbed soils and is valued for its edible leaves, which have a tangy, sour taste."
