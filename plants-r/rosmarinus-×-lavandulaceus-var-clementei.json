    "intro": "Rosmarinus \u00d7 lavandulaceus var. clementei, commonly known as Clement's rosemary-lavender hybrid, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Rosmarinus officinalis and Lavandula angustifolia. It exhibits characteristics of both parent species, featuring aromatic foliage with a mix of pine-like and lavender-like scents. The plant typically grows as a shrub with gray-green, needle-like leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink or purple. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for Mediterranean climates. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and potential use in essential oil production."
