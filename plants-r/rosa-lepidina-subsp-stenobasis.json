    "intro": "Rosa lepidina subsp. stenobasis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rock rose, is a species of flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is a shrub with woody stems and small, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in spring. The subspecies is characterized by its narrow, elliptical leaves and is often found growing in rocky or limestone soils. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. The plant plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and shelter for small wildlife."
