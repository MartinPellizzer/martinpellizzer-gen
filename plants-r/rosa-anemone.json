    "intro": "Rosa anemone, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant has finely divided, silvery-gray leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid coastal habitat. Rosa anemone thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its unique appearance and hardy nature make it a notable addition to maritime botanical collections."
