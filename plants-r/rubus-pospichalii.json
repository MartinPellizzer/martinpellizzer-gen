It is characterized by its thorny stems, trifoliate leaves, and small, dark red to black berries. The plant typically grows in forested areas and is adapted to cool, moist climates. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, and they bloom in early summer. The fruit is edible, though it is less commonly cultivated compared to other blackberry species."
