    "intro": "Roegneria confusa var. breviaristata, commonly known as the short-awned wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces spikelets that are closely arranged along the stem, with the awns (bristle-like structures) being notably short, as indicated by its variety name. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in challenging landscapes."
