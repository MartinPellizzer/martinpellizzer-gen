    "intro": "Ranunculus pedatifidus, commonly known as the broad-leaved buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and western Asia. It features a basal rosette of deeply lobed, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with five to eight petals, typically appearing in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and it is considered a characteristic species of temperate regions."
