    "intro": "Rumex angustatus, commonly known as narrowleaf sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features upright, slender stems that are often hairy, and its leaves are narrow, with a distinctive reddish color on the underside. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. It is characterized by its sour taste due to the presence of oxalic acid in its leaves. Rumex angustatus is often found in moist, disturbed soils such as along roadsides or in meadows."
