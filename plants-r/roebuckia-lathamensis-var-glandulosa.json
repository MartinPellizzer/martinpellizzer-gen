It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring. The leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine, glandular hairs, which give the plant its scientific name. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
