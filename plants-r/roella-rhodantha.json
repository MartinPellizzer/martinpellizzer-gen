    "intro": "Roella rhodantha, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are typically narrow and gray-green, reducing water loss through transpiration. Roella rhodantha is often found in coastal and inland desert environments, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife."
