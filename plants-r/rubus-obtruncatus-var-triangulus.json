    "intro": "Rubus obtruncatus var. triangulus, commonly known as the three-lobed blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to parts of North America. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are deeply lobed and give the plant its common name. The plant produces small, thorny stems and bears aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black in color. It thrives in woodland areas and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and is also used in local ecosystems as a food source for wildlife."
