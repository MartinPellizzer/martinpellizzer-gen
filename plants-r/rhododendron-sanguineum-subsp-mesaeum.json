    "intro": "Rhododendron sanguineum subsp. mesaeum, commonly known as the alpine azalea, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, such as alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, providing a striking contrast to its vibrant floral display. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological role in its native habitat."
