    "intro": "Ranunculus argoviensis, commonly known as the Swiss buttercup, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Switzerland. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, showy yellow flowers with five petals. The plant typically grows in moist, meadow-like habitats at high altitudes. Its leaves are palmately divided, and it produces small, greenish fruits that contain numerous seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
