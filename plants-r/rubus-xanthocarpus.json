    "intro": "Rubus xanthocarpus, commonly known as the yellow-fruited blackberry, is a species of brambles native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and thorny stems, typical of many Rubus species. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically yellow or orange in color, which distinguish it from other blackberry varieties. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the flowers are usually white or pale pink. This plant is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and along stream banks."
