    "intro": "Rumicastrum flavum, commonly known as the yellow velvetleaf, is a species of flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in loose inflorescences, and it is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and clearings. Rumicastrum flavum is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes other plants like hibiscus and cotton. Its adaptability to various soil types and its rapid growth make it both ecologically significant and sometimes invasive in new environments."
