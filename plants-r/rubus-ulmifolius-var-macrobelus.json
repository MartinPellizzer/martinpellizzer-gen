    "intro": "Rubus ulmifolius var. macrobelus, commonly known as the large-leafed blackberry, is a variant of the common blackberry species. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that are typically longer and wider than those of the standard Rubus ulmifolius. The plant produces dark purple to black berries that are often larger and more flavorful than typical blackberries. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland areas or along hedgerows. This variety is valued for both its ornamental appeal and its edible fruits."
