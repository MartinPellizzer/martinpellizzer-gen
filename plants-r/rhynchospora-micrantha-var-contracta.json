    "intro": "Rhynchospora micrantha var. contracta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved spikegrass, is a perennial herb native to wetland and marshy habitats in North America. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, clustered spikelets that bear tiny, usually bisexual flowers. The leaves are narrow and often have a distinctive, compressed appearance, which helps distinguish it from other similar species. It typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, contributing to the ecological diversity of wetland ecosystems. This plant plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates and birds."
