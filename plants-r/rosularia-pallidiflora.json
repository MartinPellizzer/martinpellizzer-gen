    "intro": "Rosularia pallidiflora, commonly known as the pale-flowered roseum, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit. The plant features small, pale yellow to white flowers that bloom in early summer, typically arranged in clusters. Its leaves are succulent, fleshy, and often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Rosularia pallidiflora is well adapted to rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats."
