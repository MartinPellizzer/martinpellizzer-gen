    "intro": "Rourea parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered rourea, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its woody stem and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
