    "intro": "Ruagea augusti, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its dense, dark brown wood that is highly valued for its aesthetic and structural qualities. The plant features glossy, elliptical leaves and produces small, fragrant white flowers that are often followed by orange-red berries. Ruagea augusti is typically found in moist, shaded areas of forests and is known for its slow growth rate and long lifespan. Due to overharvesting, it is also considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
