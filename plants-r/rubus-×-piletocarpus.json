    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 piletocarpus, commonly known as the blackberry raspberry, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Rubus ursinus (the blackberry) and Rubus chamaemorus (the cloudberry). It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves, typical of the Rubus genus. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or black in color, depending on the variety. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in moist, shaded environments. Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits a range of morphological and genetic variability."
