It typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant features a short, stout stem with palmate leaves that are deeply lobed and covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are bright yellow with numerous petals, often appearing in clusters at the top of the stem.
