    "intro": "Rhytidophyllum carneum, commonly known as the red-bark cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, woody trunk and a crown of large, pinnate leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces distinctive cone-like structures, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants. Its slow growth rate and unique morphology make it a subject of interest in botanical research. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
