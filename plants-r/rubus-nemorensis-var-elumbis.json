    "intro": "Rubus nemorensis var. elumbis, commonly known as the Elumbis blackberry, is a variant of the common blackberry species native to the forests of Europe. It is characterized by its prickly stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically harvested in late summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species within its native range."
