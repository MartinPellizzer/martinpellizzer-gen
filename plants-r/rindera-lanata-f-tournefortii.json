    "intro": "Rindera lanata f. tournefortii, commonly known as the woolly rindera, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and clusters of small, pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its fleshy stems and leaves help it conserve water, making it drought-tolerant. It is often found in coastal and inland regions where it thrives in full sun."
