    "intro": "Ranunculus acriformis var. typicus, commonly known as the acorn buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features delicate, palmately lobed leaves that are typically hairy and arranged alternately along its stem. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with five petal-like sepals and numerous stamens, which bloom in spring. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in many regions."
