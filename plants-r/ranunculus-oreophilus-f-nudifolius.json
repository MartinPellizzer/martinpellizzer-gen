    "intro": "Ranunculus oreophilus f. nudifolius, commonly known as the naked-leaf water buttercup, is a variant of the water buttercup characterized by its distinctive foliage. This plant typically features reduced or absent leaves, giving it a unique appearance compared to the typical form of Ranunculus oreophilus. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. The flowers are usually bright yellow with a single central pistil and showy sepals. Its botanical significance lies in its adaptation to wet habitats and its role in ecological systems."
