    "intro": "Rumex crispus subsp. microcarpus, commonly known as curled dock, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North America. It is characterized by its serrated, wavy-edged leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are typically borne on slender, erect spikes. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a common weed in disturbed soils. The species is adapted to a wide range of soil types and can thrive in both full sun and partial shade."
