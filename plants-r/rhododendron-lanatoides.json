    "intro": "Rhododendron lanatoides, commonly known as the woolly rhododendron, is a species native to the Himalayas, particularly in regions of India, Nepal, and Bhutan. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments at high altitudes, often in mountain forests. Its flowers are usually pink or red, appearing in clusters and blooming in late spring to early summer. Rhododendron lanatoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological balance of its native habitats."
