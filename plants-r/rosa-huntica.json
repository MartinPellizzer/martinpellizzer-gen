    "intro": "Rosa huntica, commonly known as the Armenian rose, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and parts of Turkey. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces clusters of fragrant, pink to red flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant has serrated, dark green leaves and is adapted to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. Rosa huntica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its beauty and hardiness. It is also used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
