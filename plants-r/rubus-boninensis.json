It is native to the Bonin Islands, a group of islands located in the Pacific Ocean. The plant is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit, with thorny stems and compound leaves. Its flowers are typically white or pink, and it produces edible berries that are similar to other Rubus species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered plant."
