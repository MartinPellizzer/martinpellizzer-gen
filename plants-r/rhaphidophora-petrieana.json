It belongs to the Araceae family, which is characterized by its distinctive inflorescence known as a spadix, enclosed by a modified leaf called a spathe. The plant produces arrow-shaped leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is valued for its ornamental and medicinal properties. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable conditions."
