    "intro": "Retama monosperma var. bovei, commonly known as the Bove's retama, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, woody pods that contain a single seed, typical of the Retama genus. It is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in scrubland and coastal areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
