    "intro": "Rhamnus heterophylla, commonly known as the variable buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its variable leaf shapes, which can range from elliptic to ovate, often with a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by orange to red berries that are an important food source for birds. Its bark is typically gray to reddish-brown and becomes fissured with age. Rhamnus heterophylla is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid conditions."
