It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and have a soft, feathery appearance. The plant produces elongated, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, typical of the Fabaceae family. Its flowers are usually yellow or cream-colored, appearing in clusters and blooming in the spring. Robinia longiloba is adapted to well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or along stream banks."
