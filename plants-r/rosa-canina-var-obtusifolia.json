    "intro": "Rosa canina var. obtusifolia, commonly known as the blunt-leaved dog rose, is a variant of the dog rose species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its broad, obtuse leaves and clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces red, hairy hips that are rich in vitamin C and are used in traditional medicine. It thrives in woodland edges and sunny meadows, preferring well-drained soils. Its ornamental value and ecological importance make it a notable species in botanical gardens and natural habitats."
