    "intro": "Rubus obtruncatus var. abnormis, commonly known as the abnormal blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant characterized by its unique morphological features. This plant is native to certain regions of North America and is often found in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are typically larger and more lobed compared to standard blackberry varieties, and the fruit can be larger and more elongated. The plant exhibits a vigorous growth habit, often forming dense thickets. Due to its distinctive traits, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists studying plant variation and adaptation."
