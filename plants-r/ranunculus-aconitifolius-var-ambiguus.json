    "intro": "Ranunculus aconitifolius var. ambiguus, commonly known as the ambiguous bellflower, is a member of the Ranunculaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, showy flowers that typically range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant features palmately divided leaves with a deeply lobed structure, resembling those of the aconite. It thrives in moist, temperate climates and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Due to its variable morphology, it is sometimes confused with other ranunculus species, hence its common name."
