    "intro": "Rhododendron arunachalense, commonly known as the Arunachal rosebay, is a flowering plant native to the eastern Himalayas, particularly in Arunachal Pradesh. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows at high altitudes, often in moist, shaded forest environments. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, providing a striking contrast to the vibrant floral display. Rhododendron arunachalense is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological balance of its native habitat."
