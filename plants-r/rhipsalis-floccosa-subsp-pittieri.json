    "intro": "Rhipsalis floccosa subsp. pittieri, commonly known as the woolly rhipsalis, is a species of cactus native to parts of South America. It is characterized by its soft, fleshy stems covered in dense, white, woolly hairs, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers during the wet season, typically in the summer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
