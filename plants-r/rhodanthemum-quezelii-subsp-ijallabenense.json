    "intro": "Rhodanthemum quezelii subsp. ijallabenense, commonly known as the Ijallaben endemic rhodanthemum, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Ethiopia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy inflorescences. The plant typically produces vibrant yellow to orange flowers, which bloom during the dry season. It thrives in rocky and well-drained soils, often found in open grasslands and shrublands. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
