    "intro": "Rumex esquirolii, commonly known as the Esquiroli's sorrel, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the high-altitude regions of southern South America. It is characterized by its alternate, broadly ovate to lanceolate leaves that are typically reddish or purplish in color, often with a waxy coating. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in loose clusters, which are typically greenish-yellow in hue. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within the Polygonaceae family."
