These plants are typically found in moist or wet habitats, such as marshes and wetlands, across temperate regions. They are characterized by their showy, blue or violet flowers that bloom in summer. Roripella species often have lance-shaped leaves and produce small, capsule-like fruits. The genus includes several species, some of which are used in traditional medicine."
