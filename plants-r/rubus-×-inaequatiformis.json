    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 inaequatiformis, commonly known as the hybrid blackberry raspberry, is a naturally occurring hybrid between Rubus ursinus (blackberry) and Rubus chamaemorus (cloudberry). This plant is characterized by its biennial growth habit, with the first year producing vegetative growth and the second year bearing fruit. The leaves are typically trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the flowers are white with five petals. The fruit is a aggregate of small drupes, often reddish or orange in color, and has a tart, acidic flavor. It is commonly found in temperate regions where its parent species overlap in habitat."
