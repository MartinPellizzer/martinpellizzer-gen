    "intro": "Rubus rusticanus f. emarginatus, commonly known as the Emarginated Blackberry, is a botanical variant of the blackberry plant characterized by its distinctive leaf morphology. This form exhibits emarginated leaf margins, which are notched or cut at the edges, distinguishing it from other Rubus species. It is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant produces small, dark berries that are edible but often have a tart flavor. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphological traits and ecological adaptations."
