    "intro": "Rhododendron lanigerum var. silvaticum, commonly known as the Silvaticum azalea, is a deciduous shrub native to the temperate regions of Asia. It features broad, ovate leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy on the underside. The plant produces clusters of showy, pink to red flowers in the spring, which are borne on elongated inflorescences. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to form dense thickets, contributing to both aesthetic and ecological benefits in its native habitat."
