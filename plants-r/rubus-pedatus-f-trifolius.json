    "intro": "Rubus pedatus f. trifolius, commonly known as the three-leaved blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant characterized by its trifoliate leaves. This form exhibits a unique leaf structure with three leaflets, distinguishing it from the typical single leaflets of the species. The plant produces small, dark red berries that are similar in taste to regular blackberries. It is often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its botanical interest lies in its morphological variation and potential use in horticulture."
