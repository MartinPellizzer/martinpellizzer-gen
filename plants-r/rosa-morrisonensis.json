    "intro": "Rosa morrisonensis, commonly known as Morrison's rose, is a rare and endangered species native to the mountainous regions of western China. It is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit, with thorny stems and clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers. The plant produces small, red-orange hips that contain seeds, which are dispersed by birds. Rosa morrisonensis thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to high-altitude conditions. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
