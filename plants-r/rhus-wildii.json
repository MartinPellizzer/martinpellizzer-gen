    "intro": "Rhus wildii, commonly known as the wild sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically divided into 10-20 narrow, pointed leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by red, fuzzy fruits that attract birds and other wildlife. Rhus wildii thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in woodland edges, thickets, and disturbed areas. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it an important species in ecological restoration projects."
