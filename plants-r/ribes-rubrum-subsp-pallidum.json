    "intro": "Ribes rubrum subsp. pallidum, commonly known as the pale gooseberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and pairs of opposite, oval-shaped leaves that are typically pale green with a slight pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by edible, tart berries that ripen to a reddish color in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable candidate for ornamental and edible landscaping. Its botanical features make it a valuable species for both ecological and horticultural purposes."
