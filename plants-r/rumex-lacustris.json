    "intro": "Rumex lacustris, commonly known as water sorrel, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland and aquatic environments. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found near ponds, lakes, and stream edges. The plant features trifoliate leaves with a distinctive glossy appearance and small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats in its habitat. Rumex lacustris is notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-rich, waterlogged conditions."
