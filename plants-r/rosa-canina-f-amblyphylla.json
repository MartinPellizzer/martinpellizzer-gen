    "intro": "Rosa canina f. amblyphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved dog rose, is a botanical variant of the common dog rose. It is characterized by its smaller, more rounded leaves compared to the typical form. The plant produces fragrant, pink to white flowers that bloom in early summer. Its hips, which are the fruit, are similar to those of the common dog rose but may be slightly smaller. This form is often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils across Europe."
