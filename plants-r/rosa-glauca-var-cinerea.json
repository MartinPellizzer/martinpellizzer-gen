    "intro": "Rosa glauca var. cinerea, commonly known as the gray rose or silverleaf rose, is a shrub-like perennial native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its pale green to silver-gray foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink to white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its stems are covered in fine, velvety hairs, and the leaves are alternate, with a slightly serrated edge. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively hardy in temperate climates."
