    "intro": "Restio nudiflorus, commonly known as the naked-flower restio, is a member of the Restionaceae family, native to South Africa. It is a perennial herb characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often hidden among the foliage, giving it its common name. It typically grows in coastal and sandy habitats, preferring well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
