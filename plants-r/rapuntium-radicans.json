    "intro": "Rapuntium radicans, commonly known as the creeping cress, is a flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with slender stems that root at the nodes and spread across the ground. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by heart-shaped, edible pods containing seeds. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and slightly hairy, often with a peppery taste. Native to temperate regions, it thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in gardens and disturbed areas."
