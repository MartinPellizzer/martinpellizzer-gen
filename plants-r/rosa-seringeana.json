    "intro": "Rosa seringeana, commonly known as the pink sand rose, is a species of flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its slender, arching stems and small, fragrant pink flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dune environments, where it plays a role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and covered in fine hairs, while its fruits are aggregate berries that develop after flowering. Rosa seringeana is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in coastal habitats."
