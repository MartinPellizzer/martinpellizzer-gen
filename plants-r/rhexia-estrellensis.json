It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as pine flatwoods and wetlands. It has narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, bead-like fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
