    "intro": "Rottlera urandra, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rottleraceae and is characterized by its evergreen, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by woody, elliptical fruits. Rottlera urandra is valued for its durable, heavy timber, which has been traditionally used in furniture and musical instruments. Its ecological importance lies in its role as a habitat for various insects and birds in its native forests."
