    "intro": "Rubus granulatus, commonly known as the granular blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its prickly stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, dark red berries that are typically consumed by birds and other wildlife. Botanically, it belongs to the Rosaceae family, which includes other familiar plants like roses and apples. Its growth habit and fruit structure are similar to other Rubus species, but it is distinguished by its granular texture and unique habitat preferences."
