    "intro": "Ranunculus recens, commonly known as the water buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland and aquatic environments. It features delicate, cup-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or white, with five to eight petals. The plant has a short, stout stem that often grows from the water's surface, and its leaves are floating or submerged, depending on the species. Ranunculus recens thrives in shallow water, often found in ponds, marshes, and along the edges of streams. Its botanical characteristics make it an important indicator species for aquatic ecosystems."
