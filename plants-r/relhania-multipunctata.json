    "intro": "Relhania multipunctata, commonly known as the African star orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to southern Africa. It is a small, terrestrial orchid with a compact growth habit and typically produces one or two flowering shoots per year. The plant features a short rhizome with a cluster of fleshy, dark brown pseudobulbs that support its leaves and flowers. Its flowers are distinctive, with a yellowish-green lip and a white or pale blue dorsal sepal, often arranged in a star-like pattern. Relhania multipunctata prefers shady, moist environments and is often found in forest understories where it thrives in the cool, humid conditions."
