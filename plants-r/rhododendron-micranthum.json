    "intro": "Rhododendron micranthum, commonly known as the dwarf rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Asia, particularly in China, India, and Nepal. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers. The plant prefers cool, humid climates and well-drained, acidic soils, often thriving in shaded forest environments. Its flowers, which bloom in spring, are usually pink or purple and are followed by small, leathery berries. Rhododendron micranthum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic qualities."
