    "intro": "Raimannia nocturna, commonly known as the nightshade lily, is a striking plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, showy, violet-blue flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its humid, rainforest habitat. Its flowering period typically occurs during the warmer months, and it thrives in partial to full shade. Raimannia nocturna is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its unique nocturnal blooming habit."
