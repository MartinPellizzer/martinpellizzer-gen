    "intro": "Rubus reflexus var. orogenes, commonly known as the alpine blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant adapted to high-altitude environments. It is characterized by its robust, thorny stems and dark green, serrated leaves. The plant produces small, dark purple berries that are typically harvested in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its hardy nature, it plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing food for wildlife in alpine ecosystems."
