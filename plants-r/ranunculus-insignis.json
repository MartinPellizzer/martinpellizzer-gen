    "intro": "Ranunculus insignis, commonly known as the Sierra primrose, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its delicate, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and yellow. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and streambanks. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss. Ranunculus insignis is an important species for pollinators and is often found in montane and subalpine regions."
