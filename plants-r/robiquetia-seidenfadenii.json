    "intro": "Robiquetia seidenfadenii, commonly known as the Malagasy orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to Madagascar. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, intricate floral structure. The plant typically grows as a terrestrial herb with a short, stocky stem and a single, showy flower. Its petals are often brightly colored, with a distinct pattern that aids in pollination by specific insect species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
