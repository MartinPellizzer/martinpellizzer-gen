    "intro": "Rosa woodsii f. hispida, commonly known as the roughleaf rock rose, is a shrub-like plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and small, oval-shaped leaves covered in a fine layer of hairs. The plant produces fragrant, pink to red flowers in late spring to early summer. Its horticultural value lies in its hardiness and ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. This variety is often used in landscaping for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
