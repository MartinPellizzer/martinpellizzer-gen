    "intro": "Rhus nodosa, commonly known as the prickly ash or winged sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are opposite and consist of 5 to 9 pairs of oval, serrated leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by red, fuzzy berries that are a food source for birds and other wildlife. Its bark is smooth and reddish-brown, with distinctive wing-like ridges, and it has thorny branches that give it a rugged appearance. Rhus nodosa is often found in moist woodlands and stream banks, where it plays an important role in local ecosystems."
