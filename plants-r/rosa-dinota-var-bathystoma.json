    "intro": "Rosa dinota var. bathystoma, commonly known as the deep-rooted rose, is a variant of the Rosa dinota species native to certain regions of South America. It is characterized by its robust, woody stems and dense, thorny growth habit. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets, and the plant is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in gardens with well-drained soil."
