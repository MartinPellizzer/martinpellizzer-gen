    "intro": "Rubus megaphyllus, commonly known as the giant leaf blackberry, is a species of brambles native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to 20 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, dark red berries that are typically consumed by birds and other wildlife. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its size and appearance, it is sometimes mistaken for other Rubus species, but it can be distinguished by its unique leaf morphology."
