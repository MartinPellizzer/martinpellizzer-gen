    "intro": "Rubus pallidus var. pseudoerubescens, commonly known as the pale raspberry. This variant is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States, characterized by its slender stems and clusters of small, pale pink to white flowers. The leaves are compound, typically with three to five leaflets, and are covered in fine, soft hairs. The fruit, a small, tart berry, ripens in late summer and is often used in jams and preserves. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial shade, making it a hardy addition to native plant gardens."
