    "intro": "Rosa tomentosa var. semitalis, commonly known as the silvery rose or the white silvery rose, is a shrub-like species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and clusters of pale pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a compact growth habit and is often used in rock gardens or as a border plant due to its ornamental value. Its leaves are covered in a fine, silvery-gray pubescence, which provides a distinctive appearance and helps to retain moisture. The variety is noted for its hardiness and ability to thrive in well-drained soil and full sun conditions."
