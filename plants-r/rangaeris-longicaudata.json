    "intro": "Rangaeris longicaudata, commonly known as the long-tailed ranga, is a unique flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, elongated inflorescences that can reach up to two meters in length, adorned with small, clustered flowers. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil to flourish. Its botanical significance lies in its distinctive morphology and ecological role within its native habitat. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
