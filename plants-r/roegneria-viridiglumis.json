    "intro": "Roegneria viridiglumis, commonly known as the green-awned wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, erect stems that often reach heights of 30 to 60 centimeters. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with green bracts, which give it its common name. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration that distinguishes it from other grass species. Roegneria viridiglumis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and thrive in harsh environmental conditions."
