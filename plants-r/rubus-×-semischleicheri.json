    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 semischleicheri, commonly known as the Semischleicher's raspberry, is a hybrid species within the Rubus genus, characterized by its thorny stems and aggregate fruits. It is native to regions of East Asia, particularly China, where it thrives in temperate climates. The plant produces small, red, edible fruits that are similar to other raspberry species but often have a more delicate flavor. Its botanical features include compound leaves with serrated edges and a flowering period that typically occurs in late spring. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and for local consumption."
