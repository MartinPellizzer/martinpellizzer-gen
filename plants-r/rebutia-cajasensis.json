    "intro": "Rebutia cajasensis, commonly known as the Cajas Mountain euphorbia, is a succulent native to the Andean regions of Ecuador. It features a short, cylindrical stem with a single, spiny, yellowish-green flower that blooms in spring. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that help it store water, adapting to its arid environment. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
