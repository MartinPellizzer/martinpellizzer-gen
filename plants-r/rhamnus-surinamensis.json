    "intro": "Rhamnus surinamensis, commonly known as Surinam buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of South America. It typically grows to a height of 3\u20136 meters and has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptic to ovate in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by dark blue, fleshy berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests and along riverbanks. The bark and leaves have been used in traditional medicine for their astringent properties."
