    "intro": "Rhoea punica, commonly known as the red hot poker, is a striking perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features tall, upright stems that bear clusters of vivid red, orange, or yellow tubular flowers, which are particularly showy in late spring to early summer. The plant has lance-shaped, gray-green leaves that are slightly hairy and arranged in a rosette at the base. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Rhoea punica is relatively drought-tolerant and attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
