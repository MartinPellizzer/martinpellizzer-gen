It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer. Its fruit, a small, dark purple berry, is edible but often has a tart flavor. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and rocky areas."
