    "intro": "Rhamnus parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved buckthorn, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are usually less than 2 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by black, egg-shaped berries in the fall. It is often found in rocky soils and along coastal areas, thriving in well-drained conditions. Rhamnus parvifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping due to its hardy nature."
