    "intro": "Rubus cardotii, commonly known as the Cardot's blackberry, is a species of brambles native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and produces small, dark purple to black berries. The plant has compound leaves with serrated edges and produces white to pink flowers in the spring. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in woodland edges and thickets. The berries are edible but have a tart flavor, making them suitable for jams and pies."
