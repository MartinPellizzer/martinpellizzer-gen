    "intro": "Reaumuria hirtella, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It is a low-growing shrub with gray-green, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited water availability. Reaumuria hirtella plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
