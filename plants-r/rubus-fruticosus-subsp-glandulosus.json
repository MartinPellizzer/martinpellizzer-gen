    "intro": "Rubus fruticosus subsp. glandulosus, commonly known as the brambles or blackberry shrub, is a perennial, thorny shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves with serrated edges and small, glandular hairs that give it a distinctive texture. The plant produces aggregate fruits, known as drupes, which are typically dark purple to black in color when mature. These fruits are edible and have a sweet, sometimes tart flavor, making them popular in culinary uses. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in hedgerows, woodlands, and along disturbed areas."
