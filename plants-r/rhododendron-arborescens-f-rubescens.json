    "intro": "Rhododendron arborescens f. rubescens, commonly known as the red-leaf azalea, is a compact, deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, upright growth habit and its showy clusters of tubular, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. The leaves are typically dark green, turning a striking red or crimson in the fall, which adds to its ornamental value. It prefers acidic, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. This cultivar is valued for its vibrant foliage and its ability to thrive in humid, temperate climates."
