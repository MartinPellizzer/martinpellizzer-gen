    "intro": "Ruschia tecta, commonly known as the stonecrop or dwarf carpet plant, is a succulent species native to South Africa. It features dense, compact growth with small, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-gray in color. The plant produces clusters of star-shaped, yellow flowers during the summer months. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Ruschia tecta is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental appeal."
