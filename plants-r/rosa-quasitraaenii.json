    "intro": "Rosa quasitraaenii, commonly known as the rare alpine rose, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers in late summer. The plant has dark green, slightly hairy leaves that are arranged alternately along the stems. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
