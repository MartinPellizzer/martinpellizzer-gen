It is characterized by its palmate leaves and showy, yellow flowers with a dark center. The subspecies reniger is distinguished by its dark, almost black, central flower color, which contrasts sharply with the bright yellow petals. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in meadows and woodland edges. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and has a long history of use in traditional medicine."
