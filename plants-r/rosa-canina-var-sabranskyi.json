    "intro": "Rosa canina var. sabranskyi, commonly known as the Sabransky dog rose, is a rare variant of the dog rose native to specific regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers and thorny stems, typical of the Rosa genus. The plant produces red or orange hips, which are rich in vitamin C and used in traditional medicine. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with serrated edges, and it thrives in well-drained, sunny soils. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a botanical curiosity and is often studied for its genetic uniqueness."
