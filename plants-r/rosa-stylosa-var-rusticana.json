    "intro": "Rosa stylosa var. rusticana, commonly known as the rough-stemmed rose, is a shrub-like plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and thorny stems, which provide structural support and deter herbivores. The leaves are compound, typically consisting of five to seven oval-shaped leaflets with serrated edges. Its flowers are usually pink to red in color, blooming in late spring to early summer. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in moderate climates."
