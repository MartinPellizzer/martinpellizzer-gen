    "intro": "Rubus flavus, commonly known as the yellow bramble, is a deciduous shrub native to parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant produces edible berries that are typically yellow or orange in color, though they are not as widely cultivated as other Rubus species. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges or disturbed soils. The leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the plant is known for its aromatic foliage."
