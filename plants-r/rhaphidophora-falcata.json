    "intro": "Rhaphidophora falcata, commonly known as the Shingleleaf Philodendron, is a tropical evergreen plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated leaves that are often wavy or undulating in appearance. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks or branches in its natural habitat. Its leaves are usually dark green with a glossy sheen and can reach lengths of up to 30 inches. Rhaphidophora falcata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in bright, indirect light."
