It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant yellow flowers that resemble those of orchids. The plant produces a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and blooms in spring. Its flowers are surrounded by a showy, petal-like bract, which adds to its ornamental appeal. Romulea callichroa is often found in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun."
