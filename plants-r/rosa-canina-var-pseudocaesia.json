It is characterized by its pale pink to white flowers, which are typically smaller than those of the typical Rosa canina. The plant has thorny stems and pinnate leaves with serrated edges. It produces red, hairy hips that are rich in vitamin C. This variety is often found in woodland edges and open habitats across Europe."
