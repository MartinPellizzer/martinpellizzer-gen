It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces aggregate fruits composed of tiny, red drupes that ripen in late summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forested areas at high elevations. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens."
