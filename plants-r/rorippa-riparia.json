    "intro": "Rorippa riparia, commonly known as the water pepper, is a small flowering plant that thrives in wetland environments. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that appear in clusters. The plant is typically found along the edges of ponds, streams, and marshes, where it can tolerate fluctuating water levels. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from waterlogged soils, and it plays a role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems. Rorippa riparia is an annual species, completing its life cycle within a single growing season."
