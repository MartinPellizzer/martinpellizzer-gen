    "intro": "Rumex acetosa var. vulgaris, commonly known as sourgrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along riverbanks. The plant features upright, hollow stems with lance-shaped leaves that have a distinctive sour taste due to high levels of oxalic acid. Its small, greenish flowers are clustered in spikes and bloom in early summer. The plant is often used in traditional medicine and as a forage crop for livestock."
