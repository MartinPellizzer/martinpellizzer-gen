    "intro": "Rubus finlaysonianus, commonly known as the Finlayson's raspberry, is a species of brambles native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or yellow in color. The plant has trifoliate leaves with serrated edges and produces white to pale pink flowers during the spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
