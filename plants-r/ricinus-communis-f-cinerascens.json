    "intro": "Ricinus communis f. cinerascens, commonly known as the ash-colored castor plant, is a variant of the castor oil plant characterized by its distinctive grayish-green foliage. The leaves are typically large, palmately lobed, and have a velvety texture. This form exhibits a unique coloration due to the presence of a waxy coating that gives it a pale, ash-like appearance. It is primarily cultivated for ornamental purposes rather than for oil production. The plant is native to tropical regions and thrives in warm, humid climates."
