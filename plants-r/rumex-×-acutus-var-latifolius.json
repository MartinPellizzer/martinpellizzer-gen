    "intro": "Rumex \u00d7 acutus var. latifolius, commonly known as broadleaf dock, is a hybrid plant that exhibits characteristics of both its parent species, Rumex acutus and Rumex obtusifolius. It is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia, typically found in moist, disturbed soils such as along roadsides or in meadows. The plant has large, broad leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are small and clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences, and it produces capsules that contain numerous seeds. This species is often used in traditional medicine and as a forage plant for livestock."
