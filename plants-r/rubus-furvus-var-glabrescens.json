    "intro": "Rubus furvus var. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant characterized by its smooth, hairless stems and leaves. It is native to the eastern United States and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically harvested in late summer. Its flowers are white and clustered in cymes, and the plant is often found in woodland edges and thickets. Due to its smooth texture, it is sometimes confused with other Rubus species but is distinguished by its lack of pubescence."
