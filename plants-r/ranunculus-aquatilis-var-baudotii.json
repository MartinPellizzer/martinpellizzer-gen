    "intro": "Ranunculus aquatilis var. baudotii, commonly known as the water crowfoot, is a aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in shallow water or along the edges of ponds, streams, and lakes. The plant has slender, branching stems with trifoliate leaves that are finely divided and often floating or submerged. Its flowers are usually yellow or white, with five to eight sepals that resemble petals, and it produces small, green, hairy fruits. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting aquatic ecosystems."
