    "intro": "Rhipsalis teres f. capilliformis, commonly known as the curly rhipsalis, is a compact, trailing cactus native to South America. It features dense, wiry stems that are covered in small, translucent tubercles, giving it a distinctive, fluffy appearance. The plant produces small, white flowers during the winter months, which are followed by pale green fruits. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is prized for its ornamental appeal and ease of care, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
