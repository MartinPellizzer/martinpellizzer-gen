The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its foliage is typically oval-shaped with a velvety texture, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in well-drained soil and full sun. This variety is often cultivated for its hardiness and ability to attract pollinators."
