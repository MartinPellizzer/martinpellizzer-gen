    "intro": "Rosa villosa var. terebinthinacea, commonly known as the woolly rose or terebinthinaceous rose, is a species of flowering shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, grayish-white pubescence covering the stems, leaves, and flowers, which gives it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces fragrant, pink to red flowers in clusters, typically blooming in the spring and early summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in soft, white hairs, contributing to its overall hirsute look. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often used in gardens for its visual appeal and hardy nature."
