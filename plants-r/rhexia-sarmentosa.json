    "intro": "Rhexia sarmentosa, commonly known as the trailing rhexia, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, trailing stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across moist, shaded habitats. The plant produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink to lavender in color. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine, soft hairs. Rhexia sarmentosa thrives in wetlands and along stream banks, contributing to the ecological diversity of its native environment."
