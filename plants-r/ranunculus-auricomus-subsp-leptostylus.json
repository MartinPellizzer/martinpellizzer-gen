    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus subsp. leptostylus, commonly known as the slender-styled golden buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features showy, yellow flowers with five to nine broadly ovate petals, often with a distinctive yellow center. The plant typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm, with trifoliate leaves that are palmately divided. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and stream banks. The subspecies is distinguished by its slender, elongated styles, which set it apart from other members of the Ranunculus auricomus complex."
