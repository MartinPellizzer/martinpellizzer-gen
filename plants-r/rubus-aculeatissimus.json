    "intro": "Rubus aculeatissimus, commonly known as the giant raspberry, is a species of bramble native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its tall, woody stems and large, trifoliate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces showy, white to pinkish flowers in the spring, followed by edible berries that are typically red or black in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in certain regions."
