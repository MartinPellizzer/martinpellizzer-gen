    "intro": "Rosularia persica, commonly known as Persian rose or Persian daisy, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to hot, dry climates. Its leaves are usually succulent and arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps reduce water loss. The flowers, which bloom in shades of pink to white, are often used in traditional medicine and horticulture."
