    "intro": "Rapanea oblonga, commonly known as the oblong leaf holly, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter in color underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by red or orange berries, which are edible for humans but toxic to livestock. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens and as a landscape plant in warm climates."
