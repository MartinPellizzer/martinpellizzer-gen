    "intro": "Rubus majusculus, commonly known as the small raspberry or dwarf raspberry, is a species of bramble in the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and small, edible red berries that appear in late summer. The plant features compound leaves with three to five leaflets and thorny stems typical of the Rubus genus. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or disturbed areas. Due to its small size and delicate fruits, it is less commonly cultivated than other raspberry species."
