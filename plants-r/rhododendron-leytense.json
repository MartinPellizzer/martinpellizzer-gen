    "intro": "Rhododendron leytense, commonly known as the Leyte rhododendron, is a rare and endemic species found primarily in the Philippines. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range in color from pink to deep red. The plant belongs to the Ericaceae family and is typically found in moist, shaded forest environments. Its leaves are leathery and evergreen, providing a dense canopy that supports a variety of epiphytic flora. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
