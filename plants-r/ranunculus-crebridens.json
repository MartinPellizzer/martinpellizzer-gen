    "intro": "Ranunculus crebridens, commonly known as the clustered buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features upright, hairy stems that bear trifoliate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers with five to nine sepals that resemble petals. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens but is considered invasive in some regions."
