    "intro": "Rubus hirtus var. anaplocladus, commonly known as the woolly blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to parts of North America. It is characterized by its dense, woolly hairs covering the stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, dark red to black berries that are typically edible, though some varieties may have a tart flavor. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an important species for both ecological studies and local biodiversity."
