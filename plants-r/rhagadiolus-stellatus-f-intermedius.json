    "intro": "Rhagadiolus stellatus f. intermedius, commonly known as the intermediate starflower, is a rare and unique variant of the starflower genus. It is characterized by its striking star-shaped flowers, which typically display a blend of white and pink hues. The plant is native to specific regions in southern Africa, where it thrives in rocky and well-drained soils. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a basal rosette. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
