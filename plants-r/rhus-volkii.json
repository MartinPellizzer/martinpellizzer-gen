    "intro": "Rhus volkii, commonly known as the African rock fig, is a small evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are often gray-green in color, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible, fig-like fruits that are an important food source for wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Rhus volkii is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in rocky or coastal landscapes."
