    "intro": "Ranunculus glacialis var. crithmifolius, commonly known as the alpine buttercup, is a variant of the glacier buttercup characterized by its distinctive, finely divided leaves that resemble those of the plantain. It is a herbaceous perennial native to alpine regions of Europe and Asia, typically found in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations. The plant produces showy yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom in early summer. Its growth habit is low and spreading, with stems that often root at the nodes. It is adapted to cold climates and has a slow growth rate, making it a hardy yet delicate species in botanical gardens."
