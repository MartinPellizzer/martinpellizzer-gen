    "intro": "Rubus inopacatus, commonly known as the alpine blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and produces small, dark purple to black berries. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are typically trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the flowers are white with five petals. Due to its habitat, it is relatively rare and often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes."
