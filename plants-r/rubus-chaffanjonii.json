    "intro": "Rubus chaffanjonii, commonly known as the Chaffanjon blackberry, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of South America, particularly in countries like Argentina and Chile. The plant is characterized by its thorny stems, compound leaves, and small, dark berries that ripen in the autumn. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and full sun exposure. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species in the wild."
