    "intro": "Rollinia laurifolia var. longipes, commonly known as the long-peduncled laurelberry, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are often elliptical in shape and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles, followed by edible, round berries that turn from green to red as they mature. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is occasionally cultivated in subtropical regions."
