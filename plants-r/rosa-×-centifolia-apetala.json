    "intro": "Rosa \u00d7 centifolia apetala, commonly known as the white garden rose, is a hybrid species within the Rosa genus. It is characterized by its large, fragrant, white petals that lack the typical red or pink hues found in other centifolia varieties. This plant typically grows as a shrub with thorny stems and dark green foliage. It thrives in temperate climates and requires well-drained soil and full sun exposure. The flowers are often used in ornamental gardening and historical perfumery due to their delicate appearance and subtle fragrance."
