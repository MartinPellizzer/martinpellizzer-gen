    "intro": "Rubus mollifrons, commonly known as the soft-leaved blackberry, is a species of bramble native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its trailing or climbing growth habit, with thorny stems and pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black when mature. Its flowers are white to pink and appear in clusters, often accompanied by a dense covering of fine hairs. Rubus mollifrons is valued for its edible berries and its role in ecological systems as a food source for wildlife."
