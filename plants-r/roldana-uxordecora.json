    "intro": "Roldana uxordecora, commonly known as the ornate bride's flower, is a rare and striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its vibrant, bi-colored petals that range from deep purple to bright yellow, creating a visually captivating display. The plant has a compact, bushy growth habit with thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid environment. It blooms during the late spring and early summer, producing clusters of fragrant flowers that attract pollinators like bees and hummingbirds. Due to its unique appearance and limited habitat, Roldana uxordecora is considered a conservation concern."
