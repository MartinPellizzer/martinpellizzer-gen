    "intro": "Rosa caesia var. lintonii, commonly known as the Linton's pink, is a rare and delicate species of rose native to the mountainous regions of central China. It is characterized by its pale pink to white flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring slender stems and finely divided, pinnate leaves. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a challenging but rewarding plant for specialized gardens. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for conservation purposes."
