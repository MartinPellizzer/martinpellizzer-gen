    "intro": "Restio fruticosus, commonly known as the coastal restio, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a member of the Restiaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with narrow, strap-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, which are typically borne on long, slender stems. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes or near the edges of freshwater bodies. Restio fruticosus is adapted to salt spray and strong winds, making it a resilient plant in harsh coastal environments."
