    "intro": "Rubus mandonii, commonly known as the Mandon's bramble, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in countries like Afghanistan and Pakistan. The plant is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in the summer. Its fruits, which are edible, are typically red or black berries that develop after the flowers. Rubus mandonii plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for wildlife and contributing to soil stability in its native habitat."
