    "intro": "Regina, commonly known as the queen fern, is a type of fern belonging to the genus Cyrtomium. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage and distinctive, fan-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly, forming dense clumps over time. Regina is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its lush, green appearance."
