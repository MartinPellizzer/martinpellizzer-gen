    "intro": "Ribes spicatum subsp. pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent gooseberry, is a shrub native to North America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces edible berries that are typically red or orange when mature, though they are often tart and less commonly consumed than other gooseberry varieties. Its leaves are ovate with serrated edges and are covered in fine, soft hairs, contributing to its common name. This subspecies is often found in moist, woodland areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
