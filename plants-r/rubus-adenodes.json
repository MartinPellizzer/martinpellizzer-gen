    "intro": "Rubus adenodes, commonly known as the hairy raspberry, is a species of bramble native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its thorny stems, compound leaves with serrated edges, and small, aggregate fruits that develop from multiple flowers. The plant produces white to pale yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically followed by red or orange berries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forests or along stream banks. The leaves and fruits are sometimes used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
