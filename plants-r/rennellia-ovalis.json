    "intro": "Rennellia ovalis, commonly known as the Rennell lily, is a flowering plant native to the island of Rennell in the Solomon Islands. It is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories. Its leaves are broad and oval, with a waxy texture that helps retain moisture. Rennellia ovalis is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
