    "intro": "Rubus abruptifolius, commonly known as the abrupt-leaf blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its prickly stems and compound leaves that are sharply toothed and abruptly narrowed at the base. The plant produces small, dark red berries that are typically consumed by birds and other wildlife. It thrives in moist, wooded areas and is often found in the understory of deciduous forests. Botanically, it is notable for its complex inflorescence and the presence of stinging hairs on its foliage."
