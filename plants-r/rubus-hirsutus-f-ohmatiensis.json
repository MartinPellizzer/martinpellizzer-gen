    "intro": "Rubus hirsutus f. ohmatiensis, commonly known as the Ohmatien raspberry, is a botanical variant of the brambles native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its erect growth habit and dense, thorny stems, which provide structural support and protection. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red when ripe, with a tart flavor and a high acidity level. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated margins, and are covered in fine, soft hairs. This form is notable for its ornamental value and is often cultivated for both its aesthetic appeal and edible fruits."
