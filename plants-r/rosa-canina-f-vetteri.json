It is characterized by its distinctive floral structure and foliage, which exhibit subtle variations from the typical Rosa canina. The plant is typically found in temperate regions, often growing in woodland or hedgerow environments. Its flowers are usually pink to red in color, with five petals and a strong, sweet fragrance. This form is of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its unique genetic traits and ornamental value."
