    "intro": "Rubus hirtus f. fuscatus, commonly known as the bristly blackberry, is a subspecies of the blackberry plant native to North America. It is characterized by its thorny stems and trifoliate leaves, which are typically covered in fine, bristly hairs. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are edible but often described as having a tart flavor. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, loamy soils and full sun to partial shade. This subspecies is often found in woodland edges, thickets, and disturbed areas, where it plays a role in supporting local wildlife."
