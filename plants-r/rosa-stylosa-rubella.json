It features showy, white flowers that bloom in clusters, often with a reddish tinge, and are surrounded by bracts that add to its ornamental appeal. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that are usually dark green and slightly hairy. Its stems are distinctive, often reddish or purplish, and become more pronounced as the plant matures.
