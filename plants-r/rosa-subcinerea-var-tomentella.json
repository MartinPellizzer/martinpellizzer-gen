    "intro": "Rosa subcinerea var. tomentella, commonly known as the woolly shrub rose, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, silver-white fuzzy hairs covering the stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, woolly appearance. The plant produces fragrant pink to red flowers in the spring, which are typically borne on long, arching stems. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets with a hairy texture. This variety is well adapted to dry, rocky habitats and is often found in chaparral and woodland areas."
