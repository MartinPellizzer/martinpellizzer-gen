    "intro": "Rhaphidophora hallieri, commonly known as the velvetleaf caladium, is a tropical plant native to the Caribbean and Central America. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that are often brightly colored with variegation in shades of green, red, and white. The plant belongs to the Araceae family, which includes other ornamental plants like philodendrons and peace lilies. Its foliage is the primary ornamental feature, making it popular as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings. Rhaphidophora hallieri thrives in humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
