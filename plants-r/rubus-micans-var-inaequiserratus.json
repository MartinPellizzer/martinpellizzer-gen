It is characterized by its dark purple to black berries, which are typically small and have a tart flavor. The plant produces compound leaves with serrated edges, though the serrations are uneven in pattern, giving it its scientific name. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. The fruit is used in culinary applications and is also valued for its ornamental qualities."
