    "intro": "Rubus hypodasys, commonly known as the evergreen blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its thorny stems, trifoliate leaves, and dark purple to black berries that ripen in late summer. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by the edible fruits. Its berries are often used in jams and wines due to their high acidity and rich flavor. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodland areas."
