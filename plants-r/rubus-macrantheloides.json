    "intro": "Rubus macrantheloides, commonly known as the large-fruited blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its thorny stems, trifoliate leaves, and aggregate fruits that develop from multiple ovaria. The plant produces dark purple to black berries that are typically larger than those of other Rubus species. It thrives in moist, woodland habitats and is often found in the understory of mixed hardwood forests. Botanically, it is notable for its complex floral structure and its role in local ecosystems as a food source for various wildlife."
