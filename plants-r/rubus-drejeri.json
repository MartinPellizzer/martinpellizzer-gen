    "intro": "Rubus drejeri, commonly known as the Danish raspberry, is a species of bramble native to northern Europe. It is characterized by its trailing stems and small, aggregate fruits that ripen to a deep red color. The plant produces pale yellow flowers with five petals and has serrated leaves with a hairy texture. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and protected species in several countries."
