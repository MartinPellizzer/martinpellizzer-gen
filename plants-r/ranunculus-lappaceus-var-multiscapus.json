    "intro": "Ranunculus lappaceus var. multiscapus, commonly known as the alpine buttercup, is a herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It features delicate, yellow flowers with five petals and numerous stamens, typical of the Ranunculaceae family. The plant has finely divided, trifoliate leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, aiding in water retention in its alpine habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or grassy meadows at high elevations. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and protected areas."
