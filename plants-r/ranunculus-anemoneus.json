    "intro": "Ranunculus anemoneus, commonly known as the lesser celandine, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features bright yellow flowers with 5-15 petals, typically blooming in early spring. The plant has a rhizomatous root system and is often found in moist, shaded woodland areas. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three deeply lobed leaflets. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and ability to outcompete native flora."
