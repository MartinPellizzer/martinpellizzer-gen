It belongs to the family Ericaceae and is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces showy, pink to red flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its leaves are usually elliptical and have a waxy texture, adapted to the humid, tropical climate of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
