    "intro": "Rhododendron wardii var. wardii, commonly known as the Ward's rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of pink to white. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in forest understories where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, providing a striking contrast to its vibrant floral displays. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with appropriate soil and climate conditions."
