    "intro": "Rubus lithophilus, commonly known as the rock raspberry, is a species of bramble native to rocky and alpine environments. It is characterized by its woody stems and compound leaves, which are adapted to withstand harsh, arid conditions. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or black in color, similar to other Rubus species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant in its native habitats."
