It is a natural hybrid between Rubus ursinus (blackberry) and Rubus idaeus (raspberry), resulting in a plant that exhibits characteristics of both parent species. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically a deep red or black when ripe, with a tart flavor. Its thorny stems and trifoliate leaves are typical of the Rubus genus. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils."
