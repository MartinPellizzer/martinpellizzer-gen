    "intro": "Rubus fuscus var. sciophilus, commonly known as the shade raspberry, is a shrub native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or black in color. It thrives in woodland environments where it receives partial to full shade. Due to its preference for shaded conditions, it is often found in forest understories and along the edges of dense vegetation."
