It is characterized by its small, oval leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by dark blue berries that are rich in anthocyanins. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and natural habitats."
