    "intro": "Rosa viscaria var. megalocarpa, commonly known as the giant-seeded dog rose, is a variation of the dog rose species native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces notably large, woody fruits called hips, which are a distinguishing feature of this variety. Its foliage is dense and dark green, with thorny stems typical of many rose species. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy addition to gardens and natural landscapes."
