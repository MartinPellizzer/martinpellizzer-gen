    "intro": "Ricinocarpus mandonii, commonly known as the slender sea fan, is a marine flowering plant belonging to the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, branching structure that resembles a fan, with numerous small, white flowers clustered along its stems. The plant is typically found in shallow coastal waters, where it attaches itself to rocky substrates using its root-like structures. Its flowers are pollinated by small insects, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that disperse its seeds through water. Ricinocarpus mandonii plays a role in coastal ecosystems by providing habitat for various marine organisms."
