    "intro": "Rubus horridus var. hybridus, commonly known as the bristly blackberry, is a thorny shrub native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its dark green, serrated leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant produces edible berries that are typically dark purple to black in color when ripe. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and thickets. Due to its prickly growth habit, it is both a resilient weed and a valued wild plant for its fruit."
