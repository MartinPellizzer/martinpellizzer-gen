It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by red, fleshy berries in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas or along streambanks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
