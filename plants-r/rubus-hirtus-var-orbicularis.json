    "intro": "Rubus hirtus var. orbicularis, commonly known as the woolly blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to North America. It is characterized by its dense, woolly pubescence covering the stems and leaves, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are typically orbicular, meaning they are nearly round in shape, and often have a serrated margin. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that ripen to a dark purple or black color. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, moist environments."
