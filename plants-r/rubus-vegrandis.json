    "intro": "Rubus vegrandis, commonly known as the giant blackberry, is a species of brambles native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its large, thorny stems and dark purple to black fruits that are typically larger than those of other Rubus species. The plant produces showy white or pink flowers in the spring, which are followed by the development of its edible berries in late summer. Its leaves are compound, with three to five leaflets, and the plant thrives in moist, shaded environments. Rubus vegrandis is valued both for its ornamental qualities and its role in local ecosystems."
