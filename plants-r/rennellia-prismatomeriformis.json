    "intro": "Rennellia prismatomeriformis, commonly known as the Rennellia starfish plant, is a rare and unique species native to the island of Rennell in the Solomon Islands. It is characterized by its distinctive star-shaped leaves, which are thick and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native arid environment. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, adding a subtle visual contrast to its robust foliage. Its growth habit is low-growing and sprawling, often forming dense mats on rocky or sandy soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Rennellia prismatomeriformis is considered a vulnerable species."
