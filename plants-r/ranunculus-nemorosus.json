    "intro": "Ranunculus nemorosus, commonly known as the wood anemone, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and along stream banks, preferring acidic soils. The plant features delicate, white flowers with five to eight petals, often tinged with pink or purple at the base. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three heart-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, yellowish fruits that disperse by wind. Ranunculus nemorosus plays an important role in forest ecosystems, supporting various pollinators and contributing to biodiversity."
