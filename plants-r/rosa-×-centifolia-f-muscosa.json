    "intro": "Rosa \u00d7 centifolia f. muscosa, commonly known as the mossy rose, is a hybrid rose species characterized by its fragrant, pink to white flowers. It is distinguished by its dense, moss-like covering on the stems and leaves, which gives it its common name. Native to southern Europe, this plant thrives in temperate climates and requires well-drained soil. The flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, producing a sweet, honey-like scent. It is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and historical use in perfumery."
