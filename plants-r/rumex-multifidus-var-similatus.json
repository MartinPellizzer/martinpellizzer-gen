    "intro": "Rumex multifidus var. similatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved dock, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features lance-shaped leaves with a prominent central vein and finely toothed margins, which distinguish it from other dock species. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides, riverbanks, and in meadows. Its leaves are sometimes used in traditional herbal remedies, though its primary ecological role is as a weed in agricultural settings."
