    "intro": "Rhodococcum minus, commonly known as the small red alga, is a unicellular, photosynthetic organism belonging to the Rhodophyta division. It is characterized by its small, spherical cells that are typically reddish in color due to the presence of phycoerythrin, a pigment that aids in light absorption. This alga thrives in marine and freshwater environments, often found attached to rocks or other substrates. It plays a role in nutrient cycling and serves as a food source for various aquatic organisms. Rhodococcum minus is also studied for its potential in biotechnological applications, such as biofuel production."
