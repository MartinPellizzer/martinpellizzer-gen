    "intro": "Restio articulatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved restio, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Restionaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny white or pale blue flowers. It thrives in sandy or well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or inland fynbos vegetation. Restio articulatus is adapted to fire-prone environments and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
