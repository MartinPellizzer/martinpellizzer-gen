    "intro": "Rumex darwinianus, commonly known as Darwin's sorrel, is a perennial herb native to South America. It features broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly rough texture. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on erect, branching stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. Its leaves are edible and have been used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
