    "intro": "Ricinocarpus urticifolius, commonly known as the stinging nettle tree, is a tropical plant belonging to the Urticaceae family. It is characterized by its compound leaves with stinging hairs, similar to those found in common stinging nettles. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in spikes, and its fruits are dry, three-lobed capsules containing tiny seeds. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along riverbanks. The plant has traditional medicinal uses in some regions, though its stinging hairs can cause skin irritation."
