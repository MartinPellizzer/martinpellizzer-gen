It features fleshy, triangular leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Its unique appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
