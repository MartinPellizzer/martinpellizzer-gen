    "intro": "Raputia heterophylla, commonly known as the variable-leaf raputia, is a unique member of the Araceae family native to South Africa. It is characterized by its striking, often colorful inflorescence that consists of a spadix surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. The plant exhibits a wide variation in leaf shape and size, which contributes to its common name. It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or mountainous regions. Due to its ornamental value and variability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely distributed in horticulture."
