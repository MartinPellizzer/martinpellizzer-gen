    "intro": "Rubus talaikiaensis, commonly known as the Talaikia raspberry, is a species of bramble native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Rubus genus, which includes many species of shrubs commonly referred to as blackberries, raspberries, and dewberries. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or black in color, with a tart flavor. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and somewhat obscure member of the Rubus family."
