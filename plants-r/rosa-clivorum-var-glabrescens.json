    "intro": "Rosa clivorum var. glabrescens, commonly known as the alpine rose, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense foliage, with leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
