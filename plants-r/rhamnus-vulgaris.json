    "intro": "Rhamnus vulgaris, commonly known as common buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its dark green, oval-shaped leaves and produces small, black berries that are rich in anthocyanins. The plant contains a yellowish latex that can be toxic if ingested, and its roots are often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in woodland edges and hedgerows. Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is sometimes considered a weed in North America."
