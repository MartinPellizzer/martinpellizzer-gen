    "intro": "Rosa conferta, commonly known as the shrub rose, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and clusters of fragrant, pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has deeply lobed, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of down. Rosa conferta thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for garden borders and hedges. Its hardy nature and ornamental value make it a valued addition to both wild and cultivated landscapes."
