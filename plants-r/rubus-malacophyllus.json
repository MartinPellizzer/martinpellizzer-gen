    "intro": "Rubus malacophyllus, commonly known as the velvetleaf blackberry, is a species of brambles native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its dark, almost black berries that are typically covered in a fine, velvety coating. The plant produces compound leaves with serrated edges and thorny stems typical of the Rubus genus. It thrives in moist, woodland environments and is often found in the understory of forests. The berries are edible, though they are generally considered less palatable compared to other blackberry species."
