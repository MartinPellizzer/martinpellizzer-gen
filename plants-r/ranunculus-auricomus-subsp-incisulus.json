    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus subsp. incisulus, commonly known as the dissected buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features delicate, palmately divided leaves and bright yellow flowers with five petals. The subspecies is distinguished by its deeply incised leaf margins, giving it a more finely divided appearance compared to the typical form. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its cheerful blooms."
