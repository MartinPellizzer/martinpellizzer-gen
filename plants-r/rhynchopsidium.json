    "intro": "Rhynchopsidium, commonly known as the common spurge, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is characterized by its milky sap, which contains toxic compounds and can cause skin irritation. The plants typically have simple, alternate leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers clustered in complex inflorescences called cyathia. Rhynchopsidium species are often found in disturbed soils and thrive in arid or semi-arid environments. They are widely distributed across Africa, Asia, and the Americas."
