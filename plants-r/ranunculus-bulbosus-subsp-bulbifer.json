    "intro": "Ranunculus bulbosus subsp. bulbifer, commonly known as the bulbous crowfoot, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a short, stout rhizome and produces a basal rosette of pinnately lobed, hairy leaves. The plant bears showy, yellow flowers with five petals and numerous stamens, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in wet meadows and stream banks. The subspecies is distinguished by its bulb-like structures that help it survive harsh winter conditions."
