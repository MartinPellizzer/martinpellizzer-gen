    "intro": "Ranunculus fallacillus, commonly known as the false crowfoot, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges. The plant features bright yellow flowers with five to eight petals, and its leaves are deeply divided into lobes. It belongs to the buttercup family (Ranunculaceae) and is characterized by its delicate, short-stemmed structure. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
