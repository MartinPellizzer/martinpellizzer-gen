    "intro": "Ridsdalea leytensis, commonly known as the Leyte ridsdalea, is a rare flowering plant native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often found in montane forests. Its leaves are elliptical and glossy, and it produces small, rounded fruits that contain seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ridsdalea leytensis is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss."
