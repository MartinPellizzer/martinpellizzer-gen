    "intro": "Rubia munjista, commonly known as Indian madder, is a perennial herb native to the Himalayas and parts of South Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by dark red or black berries. Its roots and stems are used in traditional medicine for their astringent and anti-inflammatory properties. The plant is also valued for its dye-producing potential, as the roots yield a red pigment used in natural dyeing processes."
