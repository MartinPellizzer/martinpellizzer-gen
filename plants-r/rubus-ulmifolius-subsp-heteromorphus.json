    "intro": "Rubus ulmifolius subsp. heteromorphus, commonly known as the variable bramble, is a shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its variable leaf shape, which can range from oval to deeply lobed, giving it its subspecific name. The plant produces white to pale pink flowers in early summer, followed by edible berries that are often used in jams and wines. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including woodlands, hedgerows, and disturbed soils. Due to its adaptability and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
