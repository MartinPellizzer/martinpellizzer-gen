    "intro": "Roegneria buschiana, commonly known as the Buschian bluegrass, is a cool-season grass native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and dark green foliage that turns a striking golden hue in the fall. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, blue-gray florets, which are typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
