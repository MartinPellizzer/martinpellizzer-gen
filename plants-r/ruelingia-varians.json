    "intro": "Ruelingia varians, commonly known as the velvetleaf or purpleleaf tree, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by distinctive, round, spiny fruits. Ruelingia varians is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and clearings due to its rapid growth and adaptability. Its botanical features make it both an ornamental plant and a potential weed in certain regions."
