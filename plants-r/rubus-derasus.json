    "intro": "Rubus derasus, commonly known as the Japanese blackberry, is a species of brambles native to East Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, dark red berries that are edible but often have a tart flavor. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain regions."
