    "intro": "Retinispora obtusa var. pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf retinispora, is a compact, slow-growing shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features small, dark green leaves that are elliptical in shape and often have a slight pubescence. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a container plant. Its ornamental value lies in its dense foliage and seasonal color changes."
