    "intro": "Rhaphidophora gratissima, commonly known as the Pink Princess Monstera, is a tropical plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that are often flushed with pink or red hues, especially when exposed to bright, indirect light. The plant has a climbing habit and can grow quite large if provided with adequate support. Its foliage is glossy and textured, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Rhaphidophora gratissima prefers warm, humid conditions and is relatively low maintenance, making it an ideal houseplant for beginners."
