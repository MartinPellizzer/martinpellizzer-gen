    "intro": "Rubus nanitauricus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the temperate regions of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, thorny stems and small, dark purple to black berries that ripen in late summer. The plant produces compound leaves with three to five leaflets, which are typically narrow and have a slightly serrated edge. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or along streambanks. The fruit of Rubus nanitauricus is edible, though it is generally less flavorful compared to other blackberry species."
