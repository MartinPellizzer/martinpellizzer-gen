    "intro": "Rubus obtruncatus microgene hypochlorus, commonly known as the pale-flowered blackberry, is a shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are usually pale green with a waxy coating. The plant produces small, pale yellow to white flowers that bloom in early spring. Its fruit, a small, tart blackberry, develops from the flowers and is typically harvested in late summer. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories."
