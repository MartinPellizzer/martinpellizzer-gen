    "intro": "Rhododendron hirsutum f. laciniatum, commonly known as the serrated hirsute rhododendron, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It features dark green, leathery leaves with serrated edges, which give it its distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for shaded garden landscapes. Its ornamental value lies in its attractive foliage and showy blooms, which add both texture and color to woodland gardens."
