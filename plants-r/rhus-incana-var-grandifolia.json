It is characterized by its compound leaves that are pinnately arranged and have a smooth, hairless texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in upright clusters, followed by red, fuzzy berries that are a distinguishing feature. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in dry, disturbed soils. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
