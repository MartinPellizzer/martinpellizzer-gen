    "intro": "Rubus arrigens, commonly known as the alpine raspberry, is a species of bramble native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, often at elevations above 1,500 meters. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or yellow in color, similar to other raspberry species. Its leaves are palmately compound, with five to seven leaflets that are usually hairy and serrated. Rubus arrigens is valued for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and unique appearance."
