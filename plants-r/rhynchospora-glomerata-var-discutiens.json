    "intro": "Rhynchospora glomerata var. discutiens, commonly known as the rough spikegrass, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, commonly referred to as the sedge family. The plant is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and spike-like inflorescences. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically greenish or brownish in color, and are adapted for wind pollination. This variety is distinguished by its rough, scaly texture on the stem and leaves, which gives it its scientific name."
