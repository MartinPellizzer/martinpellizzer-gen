    "intro": "Rapanea, commonly known as the evergreen boxwood, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Lauraceae. It consists of several species, most notably Rapanea umbellata, which is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia and Africa. The plants are evergreen shrubs or small trees, characterized by their dense, compact foliage and aromatic leaves. They typically grow in moist, shaded environments and are often found in forest understories. Rapanea species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in horticulture for their hardy and low-maintenance nature."
