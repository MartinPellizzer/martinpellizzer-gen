    "intro": "Rosa \u00d7 turbinata var. multiplex, commonly known as the Multiflora Rose, is a hybrid rose species characterized by its vigorous growth and dense, thorny stems. It produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink to red, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant is known for its ability to form thickets, making it both a popular ornamental plant and a potential invasive species in some regions. Its foliage consists of dark green, serrated leaves, and it is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and adaptability. However, due to its aggressive spreading habit, it requires careful management to prevent ecological disruption."
