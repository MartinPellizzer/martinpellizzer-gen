    "intro": "Rubus graniticola, commonly known as the granite raspberry, is a species of bramble native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its woody stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or black in color. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within the Rubus genus."
