    "intro": "Rubus schmidelyanus var. arvernensis, commonly known as the Arvernian raspberry, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of central Europe. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that ripen to a deep red color, typically in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in forested or rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and locally endemic species."
