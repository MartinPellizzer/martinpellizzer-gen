    "intro": "Roegneria \u00d7 mayebarana, commonly known as the hybrid wheatgrass, is a sterile, diploid grass species resulting from the cross between Roegneria koeleri and Roegneria macrantha. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and long, narrow leaves, often forming dense, tufted clumps. The plant produces showy, spike-like inflorescences with small, two-lobed flowers, typically in shades of green or purple. It is primarily cultivated as an ornamental grass for its aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. Due to its sterility, it does not produce viable seeds, making propagation through division or rhizomes essential."
