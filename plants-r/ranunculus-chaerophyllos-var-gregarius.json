    "intro": "Ranunculus chaerophyllos var. gregarius, commonly known as the clustered buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features delicate, palmately divided leaves and bright yellow flowers with numerous small petals. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments such as meadows and forest edges. It has a short stem and produces seeds in a follicle that splits open when mature. This variant is distinguished by its clustered growth habit, which sets it apart from other ranunculus species."
