    "intro": "Robiquetia arunachalensis, commonly known as the Arunachal bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the eastern Himalayas, particularly in Arunachal Pradesh. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, white to pale blue flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments at high altitudes, often in forest understories. Its leaves are lanceolate and arranged alternately along the stem, while the flowers bloom in late summer. Robiquetia arunachalensis is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
