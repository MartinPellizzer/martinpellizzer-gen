It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, fragrant pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has finely serrated leaves and produces prickly, red-orange hips that contain seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and waste areas. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and adaptable member of the rose family."
