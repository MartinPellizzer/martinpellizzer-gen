    "intro": "Rapuntium racemosum, commonly known as the clustered buttercup, is a herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features a rosette of basal leaves that are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers with five petals, arranged in a raceme, which gives it its scientific name. Its roots are tuberous and can store nutrients, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. It is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
