    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus subsp. isophyllus, commonly known as the golden shield buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features delicate, yellow flowers with five broad, spoon-shaped petals that resemble a shield, hence its common name. The plant typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm, with basal leaves that are deeply lobed and often covered in fine hairs. Its leaves and flowers are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its natural habitat. This subspecies is often found in moist meadows, woodland edges, and stream banks, where it thrives in partial to full shade."
