    "intro": "Rubus apiculatus proles horridicaulis, commonly known as the rough-stemmed blackberry, is a shrub native to the western United States. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, dark purple to black berries. The plant has trifoliate leaves with serrated edges and produces white to pink flowers in the spring. Its berries are edible but often have a tart flavor, and the plant is adapted to thrive in rocky, dry soils. It plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing food for wildlife and stabilizing soil in arid regions."
