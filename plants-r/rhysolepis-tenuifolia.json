    "intro": "Rhysolepis tenuifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved huckleberry, is a species of shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically less than 2 centimeters in length. The plant produces clusters of white to pale pink flowers in the spring, which are followed by edible berries that ripen in the summer. Rhysolepis tenuifolia thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in forest understories. It plays an important ecological role by providing food for wildlife and contributing to forest biodiversity."
