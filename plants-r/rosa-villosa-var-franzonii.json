    "intro": "Rosa villosa var. franzonii, commonly known as the Franzonii Rosa, is a shrub-like plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Chile. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and clusters of fragrant, pink to reddish-pink flowers that bloom in spring. The leaves are typically compound, with oval to lance-shaped leaflets that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving the plant a velvety appearance. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens for its beauty and hardiness. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, thriving in temperate climates."
