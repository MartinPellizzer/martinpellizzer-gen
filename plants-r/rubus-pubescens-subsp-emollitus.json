    "intro": "Rubus pubescens subsp. emollitus, commonly known as the soft-hairy bramble, is a shrub native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often thornless stems and hairy, ovate leaves with a soft, downy texture. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits known as drupes, typically red or black in color, which are edible but have a tart flavor. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its botanical features make it distinguishable from other Rubus species, particularly in its leaf morphology and fruit structure."
