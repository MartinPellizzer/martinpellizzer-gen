It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous leaves and thorny stems, which are typical features of the Rubus genus. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically consumed fresh or used in culinary applications. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges or disturbed soils. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and agricultural settings."
