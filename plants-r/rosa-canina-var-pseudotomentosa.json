    "intro": "Rosa canina var. pseudotomentosa, commonly known as the bristly dog rose, is a variant of the dog rose native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, rugged appearance. The plant produces fragrant pink or white flowers in spring, followed by red, hairy fruits known as hips. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in hedgerows and woodland edges. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in herbal medicine."
