    "intro": "Roegneria breviglumis var. brevipes, commonly known as the short-stemmed wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, short, sturdy stems, and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny grains, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Its botanical features make it a valuable species for ecological restoration and wildlife habitat support."
