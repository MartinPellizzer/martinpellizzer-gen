    "intro": "Rubus aghadergensis, commonly known as the Aghadergen bramble, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in the areas of Tajikistan and Afghanistan. The plant is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of white to pale pink flowers. Its leaves are typically trifoliate, with a serrated margin, and it produces small, edible berries that are often used in local cuisine. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and poorly understood species."
