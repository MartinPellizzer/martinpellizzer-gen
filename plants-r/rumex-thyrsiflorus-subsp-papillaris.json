    "intro": "Rumex thyrsiflorus subsp. papillaris, commonly known as the rough dock, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks. The plant features basal rosettes of lance-shaped leaves that are covered in small, raised dots, giving them a rough texture. Its flowering stems bear dense, club-like inflorescences with tiny, greenish flowers that develop into reddish-brown, three-lobed seeds. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
