    "intro": "Rubus guentheri subsp. chlorosericeus, commonly known as the coastal blackberry, is a shrub native to coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is characterized by its slender, trailing stems and small, pale green leaves with a distinctive silvery underside. The plant produces small, dark red berries that are typically clustered in dense, rounded inflorescences. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal climates with high salt exposure and strong winds. This subspecies is often found in coastal dunes and scrub habitats, contributing to the ecological diversity of these environments."
