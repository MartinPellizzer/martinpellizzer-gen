    "intro": "Restrepia extensa, commonly known as the broad-leafed orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its long, strap-like leaves and produces clusters of fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees and rocks rather than in soil. It thrives in cool, humid environments and requires indirect light for optimal growth. Its botanical features make it a popular choice among orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value and unique appearance."
