    "intro": "Rubus kaznowskii, commonly known as the Kaznowski's raspberry, is a species of bramble native to eastern Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its thorny stems and aggregate fruits. The plant typically grows in woodland areas and thrives in temperate climates. Its leaves are usually trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in the spring. The fruit, which ripens in summer, is edible and has a tart flavor, though it is less commonly cultivated than other raspberry varieties."
