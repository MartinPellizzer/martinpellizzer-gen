    "intro": "Rubus senilis, commonly known as the white-barked raspberry, is a species of bramble native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its slender, thorny stems and small, white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, red, edible berries that are often used in jams and desserts. It thrives in moist, woodland environments and is known for its ornamental value due to its attractive, peeling bark. Rubus senilis is also valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and wildlife."
