It is characterized by its rounded, compact growth habit and smaller, more densely packed flowers compared to the typical Rosa canina. The plant produces yellowish-orange hips that are often used in herbal remedies and culinary applications. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the stems are covered in thorns. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
