    "intro": "Rottboellia repens, commonly known as carpet grass, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features rhizomatous growth, allowing it to spread aggressively and form dense mats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural settings. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it both a useful forage plant and a challenging invasive species."
