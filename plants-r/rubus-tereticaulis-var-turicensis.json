    "intro": "Rubus tereticaulis var. turicensis, commonly known as the Turcian raspberry, is a variant of the raspberry plant native to parts of Europe. It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its arching canes and clusters of small, aggregate fruits. The plant produces red, edible berries that are similar in taste to other raspberries but often have a slightly more tart flavor. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it typically grows in moist, woodland habitats. This variety is valued for both its ornamental appeal and its culinary uses."
