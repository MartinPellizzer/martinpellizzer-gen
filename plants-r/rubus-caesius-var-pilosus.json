    "intro": "Rubus caesius var. pilosus, commonly known as the hairy blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant characterized by its dense, fuzzy foliage and fruit. It is native to the eastern United States and thrives in woodland and shaded areas. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically tart and less sweet than common blackberries. Its leaves are typically trifoliate, with a hairy texture that distinguishes it from other Rubus species. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and as a source of edible, though acidic, fruit."
