    "intro": "Ranunculus pindicola, commonly known as the Pindus buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It typically grows in rocky or limestone-rich soils, often in alpine or subalpine habitats. The plant features a basal rosette of doubly serrated leaves and produces showy, yellow to orange flowers with five petals. It is a member of the Ranunculaceae family, known for its often toxic sap. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
