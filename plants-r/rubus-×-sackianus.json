It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is a cross between Rubus ursinus (the common blackberry) and Rubus chamaemorus (the cloudberry). The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or black in color, with a tart flavor. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and wetlands. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is cultivated in some regions for both horticultural and culinary purposes."
