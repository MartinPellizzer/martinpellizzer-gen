    "intro": "Rosa coriifolia f. eschfaelleri, commonly known as the Schneeballen rose, is a frost-tolerant shrub native to Central Europe. It features distinctive, fluffy white bracts that resemble snowballs, which appear in early spring before the actual flowers. The plant has slender, arching stems with thorny shoots and dark green, trifoliate leaves. Its flowers are pale pink to white, typically appearing in clusters, and it is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens. This cultivar is well-suited for rock gardens or as a border plant due to its compact growth habit."
