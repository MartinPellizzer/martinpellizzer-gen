    "intro": "Rhododendron parviflorum, commonly known as the dwarf rhododendron, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It features dense, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and elliptical in shape. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, blooming in early spring. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its compact size and ornamental value, it is often used in landscaping and garden design."
