    "intro": "Rubus turquinensis, commonly known as the Turquin blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the Andes mountains in South America. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically harvested when fully ripe. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and partial shade. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and somewhat obscure member of the Rubus genus."
