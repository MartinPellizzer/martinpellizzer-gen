    "intro": "Rourea viridis, commonly known as green rourea, is a flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically bright green, which help it store water in arid environments. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers that bloom during the rainy season. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate to bright indirect light. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in tropical gardens."
