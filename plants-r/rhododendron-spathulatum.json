    "intro": "Rhododendron spathulatum, commonly known as the broad-leaf rhododendron, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of China. It features large, ovate leaves that are typically dark green and glossy, providing a striking contrast to its showy floral display. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and requires partial to full shade for optimal growth. Rhododendron spathulatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and natural landscapes."
