    "intro": "Racinaea penlandii var. pedunculata, commonly known as the Pedunculate Racinaea, is a rare and striking fern native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Osmundaceae and is characterized by its large, feathery fronds that can reach lengths of up to three feet. The plant exhibits a unique growth habit, with its rhizomes forming dense colonies that help stabilize soil in moist, shaded environments. Its spore-bearing structures, called sorus, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, a feature typical of many ferns. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
