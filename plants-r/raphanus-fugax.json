    "intro": "Raphanus fugax, commonly known as the transient radish, is a short-lived plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its rapid growth cycle, often completing its life cycle within a single growing season. The plant typically features a rosette of pinnately lobed leaves and produces small, yellow flowers that attract pollinators. Its seeds are small and can be dispersed by wind, contributing to its ephemeral nature. Due to its brief lifespan and adaptability, Raphanus fugax is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats."
