    "intro": "Rubus caeruleicaulis, commonly known as blue-stemmed blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, bluish-green stems and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces edible berries that are typically dark purple to black in color, though they are less commonly cultivated than other Rubus species. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and mountainous regions. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
