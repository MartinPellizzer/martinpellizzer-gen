    "intro": "Rhynchospora polyphylla, commonly known as the many-leaved spikegrass, is a perennial herb native to wetlands and marshy areas in the southeastern United States. It features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces dense clusters of small, greenish-white flowers in summer. The plant is characterized by its numerous, thread-like leaves that arise from the base, giving it its common name. It plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates. Rhynchospora polyphylla is typically found in shallow water or saturated soils, making it a key indicator species for wetland health."
