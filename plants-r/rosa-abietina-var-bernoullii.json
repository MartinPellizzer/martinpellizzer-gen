    "intro": "Rosa abietina var. bernoullii, commonly known as the Alpine rose or mountain rose, is a compact shrub native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features dense, thorny stems and small, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces fragrant, pink to white flowers in late spring to early summer. It is well adapted to cold climates and can thrive in rocky or well-drained soils. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens in temperate zones."
