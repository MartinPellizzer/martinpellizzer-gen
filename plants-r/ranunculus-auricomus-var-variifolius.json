    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus var. variifolius, commonly known as the variableleaf buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features bright yellow flowers with five to nine petals, typically arranged in a cup-like shape. The plant has finely divided, trifoliate leaves that vary in shape, contributing to its varietal distinction. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens but is also considered invasive in some regions."
