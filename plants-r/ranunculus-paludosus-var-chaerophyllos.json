    "intro": "Ranunculus paludosus var. chaerophyllos, commonly known as the marsh buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It features delicate, palmately divided leaves and bright yellow flowers with five to seven sepals that resemble petals. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in marshes, fens, and along the edges of ponds. It is an important component of wetland ecosystems, supporting a variety of pollinators and invertebrates. However, it is sensitive to habitat disturbance and is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
