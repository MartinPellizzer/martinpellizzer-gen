It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, palmate leaves and showy, yellow flowers with prominent black anthers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky areas. It has a short stem and produces small, aggregate fruits that disperse its seeds. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
