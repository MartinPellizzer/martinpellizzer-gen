It is characterized by its tall, upright stems and large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a rough texture. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, which are followed by elongated, reddish fruits. Rheum sublanceolatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its striking foliage. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a versatile addition to many landscapes."
