    "intro": "Rubus compar, commonly known as the common blackberry bush, is a deciduous shrub belonging to the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces aggregate fruits, known as drupes, which are typically dark purple to black when ripe. These fruits are edible, though the stems and leaves contain irritants. Rubus compar thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils."
