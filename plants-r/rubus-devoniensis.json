    "intro": "Rubus devoniensis, commonly known as the Devon raspberry, is a species of bramble native to western Europe. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves, typical of the Rubus genus. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or yellow in color. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodland edges and stream banks. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species."
