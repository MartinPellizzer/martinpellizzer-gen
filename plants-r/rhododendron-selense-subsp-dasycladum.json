    "intro": "Rhododendron selense subsp. dasycladum, commonly known as the Himalayan rhododendron, is a shrub native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in cool, moist environments, often on rocky slopes or in forested areas. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, providing a striking contrast to the vibrant pink or red flowers. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in temperate climates."
