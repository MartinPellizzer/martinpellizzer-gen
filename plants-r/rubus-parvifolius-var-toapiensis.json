    "intro": "Rubus parvifolius var. toapiensis, commonly known as the Toapi raspberry, is a shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its small, trifoliate leaves and clusters of small, red berries that ripen in the dry season. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in disturbed habitats such as forest edges and clearings. Its fruit is edible, though typically consumed raw or used in local culinary traditions. The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
