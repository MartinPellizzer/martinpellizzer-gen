    "intro": "Rhododendron macrosepalum var. linearifolium, commonly known as the linear-leaved rhododendron, is a rare and ornamental plant native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its elongated, narrow leaves that give it its varietal name, and its striking clusters of tubular, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in acidic, well-drained soils and thrives in shaded, humid environments. Its floral display, featuring shades of pink to red, makes it a sought-after species among horticulturists. Due to its limited natural range and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and specialized collections."
