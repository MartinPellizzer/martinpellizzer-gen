    "intro": "Rudolphia portoricensis, commonly known as the Puerto Rican rudolphia, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean island of Puerto Rico. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas of the forest understory, where it thrives in humid conditions. Rudolphia portoricensis has lance-shaped leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits containing seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
