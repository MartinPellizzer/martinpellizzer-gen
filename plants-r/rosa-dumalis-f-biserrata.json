    "intro": "Rosa dumalis f. biserrata, commonly known as the serrated wild rose, is a botanical variant of the Rosa dumalis species. It is characterized by its distinctive serrated leaf margins and thorny stems, which are typical features of many rose species. The plant produces fragrant pink to red flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are simple and alternate, with a glossy upper surface and a lighter underside. This subspecies is often found in rocky or mountainous regions, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight."
