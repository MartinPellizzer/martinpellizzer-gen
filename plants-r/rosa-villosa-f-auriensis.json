    "intro": "Rosa villosa f. auriensis, commonly known as the golden-leaf rose, is a cultivar of the Rosa villosa species, characterized by its distinctive golden foliage. It is a deciduous shrub that produces fragrant pink to white flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant is native to North America and thrives in full sun to partial shade, preferring well-drained soil. Its ornamental value comes from both its vibrant foliage and showy blooms, making it a popular choice for gardens. It is relatively hardy and resistant to common rose diseases, though it may require regular pruning to maintain its shape and promote healthy growth."
