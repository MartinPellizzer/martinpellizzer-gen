    "intro": "Rosa \u00d7 dumetorum f. interposita, commonly known as the Alpine rose or evergreen rose, is a hybrid species native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, thornless stems and evergreen foliage, which remain green throughout the year. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens with cold climates."
