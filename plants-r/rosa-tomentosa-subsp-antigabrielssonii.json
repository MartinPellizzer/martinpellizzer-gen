    "intro": "Rosa tomentosa subsp. antigabrielssonii, commonly known as the Antigabrielsson's wooly rose, is a shrub-like species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly silver-gray foliage that provides a striking visual contrast to its pink to red flowers. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits called rosehips, which are typically red or orange in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance and hardy nature."
