    "intro": "Rubus macradenius, commonly known as the giant raspberry. It is a species of bramble within the Rubus genus, characterized by its large, thorny stems and clusters of white to pink flowers. The plant produces edible berries that are typically red or black when ripe, though they are often smaller than those of other raspberry species. It is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and thrives in woodland and scrubland habitats. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in certain environments."
