    "intro": "Rubus geminatus, commonly known as the twinfruit blackberry, is a species of brambles native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and produces small, dark purple to black berries. The plant has trifoliate leaves with serrated edges and produces white to pale pink flowers in the spring. It thrives in moist, woodland habitats and is often found in the understory of forests. The berries are edible but have a tart flavor, making them suitable for jams and pies."
