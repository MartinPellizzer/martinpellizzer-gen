    "intro": "Rubus hirtus f. aciculatus, commonly known as the prickly blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to parts of North America. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and small, elliptical leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black when mature. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and thickets. Due to its thorny structure, it is often considered a challenging species to harvest."
