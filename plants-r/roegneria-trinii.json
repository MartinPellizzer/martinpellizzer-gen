    "intro": "Roegneria trinii, commonly known as the three-flowered bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and small, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces dense clusters of tiny, three-flowered spikelets, which are typically blue to purple in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Roegneria trinii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in wet environments."
