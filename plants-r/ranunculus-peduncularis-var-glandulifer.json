    "intro": "Ranunculus peduncularis var. glandulifer, commonly known as the glandular-stem buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features basal leaves that are palmately divided with serrated edges, and its stems are hairy and often glandular. The plant produces showy yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It prefers moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and stream banks. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
