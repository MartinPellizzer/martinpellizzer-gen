    "intro": "Ricinocarpos glaucus, commonly known as the blue thorn apple, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its hairy, blue-green leaves and yellow flowers. The plant produces small, round berries that turn from green to red as they mature. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its toxic properties, it is generally avoided by both animals and humans."
