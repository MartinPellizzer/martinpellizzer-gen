    "intro": "Rubus lividus, commonly known as the pale bramble, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is a shrub native to Europe and parts of western Asia, characterized by its thorny stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer. Its fruits, known as blackberries, are typically small and edible, though they are not as commonly cultivated as other Rubus species. Rubus lividus thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, loamy conditions."
