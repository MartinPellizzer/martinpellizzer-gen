    "intro": "Rubus saltivivus, commonly known as the salt-tolerant raspberry, is a shrub native to coastal regions where it thrives in saline soils. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and clusters of small, red berries. The plant has thick, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid or salty environments. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, and they bloom in early summer. Rubus saltivivus is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing food for local wildlife."
