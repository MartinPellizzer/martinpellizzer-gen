It features elliptical to obovate leaves that are typically glossy and dark green on top with a whitish underside. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are yellowish-green in color, followed by red or purple berries that are attractive to birds. It has a shallow root system and is often used as a hedge or ornamental plant due to its hardy nature and adaptability. The leaves and berries are also used in traditional medicine for their aromatic and astringent properties."
