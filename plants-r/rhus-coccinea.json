    "intro": "Rhus coccinea, commonly known as the scarlet buckeye, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its opposite, palmately lobed leaves that turn bright red in the fall. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, spiny fruits containing one or two seeds. Its botanical features include smooth, gray bark and a tendency to form dense thickets. Rhus coccinea is often found in moist, rich soils along stream banks and in woodland edges."
