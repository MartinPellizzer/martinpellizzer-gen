    "intro": "Riedelia monophylla, commonly known as the single-leaf riedelia, is a rare and striking member of the Cactaceae family. It is native to a small region in southern Mexico, where it thrives in rocky, arid environments. The plant is characterized by its unique, large, paddle-shaped leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It produces yellow flowers during the spring, adding a vivid contrast to its foliage. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
