    "intro": "Rhynchophora, commonly known as the snailgrass or false dandelion, is a genus of flowering plants in the daisy family, Asteraceae. These plants are characterized by their basal rosettes of leaves and showy, yellow flower heads that resemble dandelion blooms. Rhynchophora species are typically found in moist, temperate regions and are often used in traditional herbal medicine. They have hairy stems and leaves, and their flowers are composed of both ray and disc florets. The genus includes several species, such as Rhynchophora hirta, which is native to Europe and parts of Asia."
