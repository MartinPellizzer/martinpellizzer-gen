    "intro": "Ranunculus involucratus, commonly known as the woolly buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and bright yellow, showy flowers that typically bloom in early spring. The plant grows in rocky or alpine habitats, often in moist, well-drained soils. Its flowers have five to nine petals and are surrounded by a cluster of sepals that form a distinctive involucrum. Ranunculus involucratus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
