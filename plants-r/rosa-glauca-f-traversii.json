    "intro": "Rosa glauca f. traversii, commonly known as the blue rose or traversii rose, is a rare and striking variant of the Rosa glauca species. It is characterized by its pale blue or lavender-colored flowers, which are a result of a genetic mutation affecting pigmentation. The plant typically grows as a shrub with thorny stems and dark green, leathery leaves. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, where it thrives in cool, temperate climates. Due to its rarity and unique appearance, it is highly valued in horticulture and botanical collections."
