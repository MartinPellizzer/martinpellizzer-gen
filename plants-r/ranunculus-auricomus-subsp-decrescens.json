    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus subsp. decrescens, commonly known as the creeping buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread aggressively in moist, disturbed soils. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with five petals, typically appearing in early spring. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a distinctive glossy appearance. It is often found in wet meadows, ditches, and along stream banks, where it thrives in damp conditions."
