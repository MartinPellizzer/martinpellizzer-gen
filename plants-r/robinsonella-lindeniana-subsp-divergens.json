It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many flowering plants with small, four-petaled flowers. The subspecies is characterized by its compact growth habit and hairy leaves, adapted to thrive in rocky and well-drained soils. It produces yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, rounded pods. This plant is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it contributes to the biodiversity of high-altitude ecosystems."
