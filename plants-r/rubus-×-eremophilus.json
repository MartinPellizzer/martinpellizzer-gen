    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 eremophilus, commonly known as the alpine raspberry, is a hybrid shrub belonging to the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, aggregate fruits that ripen to a reddish color. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, such as alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are compound, with serrated edges and a hairy texture, and it produces white to pale pink flowers in early summer. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and unique appearance."
