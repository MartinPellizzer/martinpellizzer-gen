    "intro": "Rubus procerus f. virideocinereus, commonly known as the green-gray bramble, is a variant of the bramble genus Rubus. It is characterized by its distinctive greenish-gray foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in temperate regions, often in woodland or hedgerow environments. Its leaves are usually trifoliate, with a serrated margin, and it produces small, aggregate fruits known as drupes. This form is noted for its hirsute (hairy) texture on both leaves and stems, contributing to its unique appearance."
