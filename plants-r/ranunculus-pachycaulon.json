    "intro": "Ranunculus pachycaulon, commonly known as the thick-stemmed buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a distinctive, thick, woody caudex that stores water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces showy, cup-shaped flowers with five to nine petals, typically in shades of yellow, orange, or red. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a hairy surface that helps reduce water loss. Ranunculus pachycaulon is often found in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations."
