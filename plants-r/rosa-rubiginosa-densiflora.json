    "intro": "Rosa rubiginosa densiflora, commonly known as the denseflowered bramble rose, is a shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and dense clusters of small, fragrant pink flowers. The plant produces oval, hairy leaves with serrated edges, and its flowers typically bloom in late spring to early summer. It is often found in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky slopes and woodland edges. The rose is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used historically in hedging and as a source of edible hips."
