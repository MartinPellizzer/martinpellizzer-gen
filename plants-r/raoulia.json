    "intro": "Raoulia, commonly known as the \"silk cotton tree,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly in Central and South America. Raoulia species are characterized by their showy, fluffy seed pods and large, palmately lobed leaves. They typically grow as small to medium-sized trees or shrubs, often reaching heights of up to 10 meters. The flowers are usually pink or red, and they produce a cotton-like fiber that is used in traditional crafts and as a natural insulating material."
