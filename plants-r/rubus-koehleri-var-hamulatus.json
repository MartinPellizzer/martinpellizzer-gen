    "intro": "Rubus koehleri var. hamulatus, commonly known as the slender blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and less commonly cultivated species."
