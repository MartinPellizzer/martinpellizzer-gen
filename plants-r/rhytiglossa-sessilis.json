    "intro": "Rhytiglossa sessilis, commonly known as the sessile-tongue orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its unique, tongue-shaped flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with rhizomes that allow it to spread and form dense colonies. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, and it thrives in shaded, moist environments. Rhytiglossa sessilis is often found in forest understories and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
