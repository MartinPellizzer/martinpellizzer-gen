    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 praecorruptus, commonly known as the blackberry raspberry, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Rubus ursinus (the raspberry) and Rubus chamaemorus (the cloudberry). It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that ripen to a deep red or black color, depending on the variety. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in moist, acidic soils. Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits a range of morphological and genetic variability."
