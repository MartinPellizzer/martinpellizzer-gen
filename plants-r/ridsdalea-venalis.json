    "intro": "Ridsdalea venalis, commonly known as the slender swamp orchid, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in Australia. It is a perennial herb with a short, upright stem and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in a spike, which are often clustered at the top of the stem. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is typically found in swampy or marshy areas. Ridsdalea venalis plays an important ecological role in its native environment by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates."
