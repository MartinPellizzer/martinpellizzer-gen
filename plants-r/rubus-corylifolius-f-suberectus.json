    "intro": "Rubus corylifolius f. suberectus, commonly known as the upright blackberry shrub, is a variant of the Chinese blackberry species. It is characterized by its upright growth habit, distinguishing it from the more spreading forms of its species. The plant produces dark purple to black berries that are typically small and tart. Its leaves are compound, with three to five leaflets that are serrated and have a distinctive, somewhat heart-shaped base. This form is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its compact size and attractive foliage."
