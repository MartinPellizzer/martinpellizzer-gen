    "intro": "Rhipidocladum ampliflorum, commonly known as the broadflowered dune grass, is a flowering plant native to arid and coastal regions. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with dense, fibrous roots that help stabilize sandy soils. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming during the warmer months. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, adapted to conserve water in harsh environments. Rhipidocladum ampliflorum plays an important ecological role in preventing soil erosion and supporting local biodiversity."
