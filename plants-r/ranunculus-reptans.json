    "intro": "Ranunculus reptans, commonly known as the creeping buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, bright yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in early spring. The plant has a sprawling growth habit, with stems that root at the nodes and spread across the ground. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Ranunculus reptans thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks."
