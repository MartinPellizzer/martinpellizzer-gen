    "intro": "Reseda truncata var. muelleri, commonly known as Mueller's cut-leaved reseda, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, truncate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense, terminal clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens and dry garden settings. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a valued addition to horticultural collections."
