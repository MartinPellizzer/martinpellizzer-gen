    "intro": "Rumex dumosiformis, commonly known as the creeping sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a low-growing, mat-forming habit with fleshy, succulent leaves that are often reddish or purple in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, typically in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves contain oxalic acid, which can be toxic if ingested in large quantities."
