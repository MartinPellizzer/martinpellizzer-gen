    "intro": "Rebutia pygmaea var. iscayachensis, commonly known as the Iscaya Rebutia, is a compact cactus native to the Andes mountains of Peru. It features a globular stem with a smooth, pale green surface that often develops a slight waxy coating. The plant produces small, vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. Due to its unique appearance and slow growth, it is a popular choice among cactus enthusiasts."
