    "intro": "Romulea bulbocodium var. syriaca, commonly known as the Syrian sand orchid, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Syria and Turkey. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its compact, bulbous root system and delicate, grass-like foliage. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, yellowish-green flowers during the spring season. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires a sunny to partially shaded environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
