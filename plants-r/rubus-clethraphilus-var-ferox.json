    "intro": "Rubus clethraphilus var. ferox, commonly known as the alpine raspberry, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, aggregate fruits. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and cool climates. Its leaves are usually trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it produces white or pale pink flowers in early summer. The fruit, while edible, is generally less palatable than other raspberry varieties and is often used in local traditional cuisines."
