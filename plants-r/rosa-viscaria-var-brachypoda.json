    "intro": "Rosa viscaria var. brachypoda, commonly known as the short-stemmed prickly rose, is a shrub-like species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, fragrant pink or white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets with a slightly hairy texture. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, often found in rocky or alpine environments. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both horticultural study and ecological research."
