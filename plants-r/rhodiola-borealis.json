    "intro": "Rhodiola borealis, commonly known as the Arctic rose or mountain rhodiola, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It belongs to the family Crassulaceae and is characterized by its fleshy, succulent stems and leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky, alpine, or tundra environments where it thrives in cold and harsh conditions. Its flowers are usually pink or red, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Rhodiola borealis is well adapted to low temperatures and has a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils."
