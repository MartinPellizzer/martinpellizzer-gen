    "intro": "Retrophyllum rospigliosii, commonly known as the Rospiglio's retrophyllum, is a rare and unique plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its distinctive, often fragrant foliage. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, where it can thrive without direct sunlight. Its leaves are usually narrow and elongated, with a slightly hairy texture, and it produces small, delicate flowers in the spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
