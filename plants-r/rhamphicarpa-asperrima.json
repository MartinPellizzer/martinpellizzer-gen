    "intro": "Rhamphicarpa asperrima, commonly known as the rough-stemmed sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is a low-growing perennial herb with succulent, ribbed stems that are covered in fine, stiff hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in late summer. Its leaves are narrow, fleshy, and often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Rhamphicarpa asperrima is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
