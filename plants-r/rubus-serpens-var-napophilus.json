    "intro": "Rubus serpens var. napophilus, commonly known as the creeping blackberry, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and thornless stems, which allow it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically consumed by wildlife. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a serrated margin, with a glossy upper surface. This variety is often found in moist, disturbed soils in woodland edges and along stream banks."
