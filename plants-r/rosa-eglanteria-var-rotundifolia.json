    "intro": "Rosa eglanteria var. rotundifolia, commonly known as the round-leaved prickly rose, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems, heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges, and clusters of small, fragrant pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The leaves are typically rounded, giving the plant its common name, and they are often covered in fine hairs. This species is adapted to a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions and full sun. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and historical use in perfumery."
