    "intro": "Rumex \u00d7 steinii, commonly known as the hybrid sorrel, is a perennial plant that belongs to the Polygonaceae family. It is a natural hybrid between Rumex acetosa (common sorrel) and Rumex acetobipennis (broad-leaved sorrel), resulting in a plant with distinctive morphological features. The leaves are typically heart-shaped with a reddish coloration on the veins, and the plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits variability in growth habits and leaf characteristics."
