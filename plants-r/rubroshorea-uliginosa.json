It is characterized by its aromatic, gray-green foliage and small, pale purple flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant thrives in acidic, waterlogged soils and is often found in marshes and peat bogs. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their antiseptic and anti-inflammatory properties. Rubroshorea uliginosa plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various insect species."
