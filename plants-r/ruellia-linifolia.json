    "intro": "Ruellia linifolia, commonly known as silverleaf ruellia, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is a perennial herb with lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silvery hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of blue or purple flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along streambanks. Ruellia linifolia is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions."
