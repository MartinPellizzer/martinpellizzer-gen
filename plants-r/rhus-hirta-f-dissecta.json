    "intro": "Rhus hirta f. dissecta, commonly known as the dissected sumac, is a shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its finely dissected, feather-like leaves that give it a delicate appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by red, hairy fruits that are a common food source for birds. Its botanical features include compound leaves with numerous leaflets and a woody stem that can become branched. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and thickets."
