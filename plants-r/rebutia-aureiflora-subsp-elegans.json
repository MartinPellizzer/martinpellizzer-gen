    "intro": "Rebutia aureiflora subsp. elegans, commonly known as the Elegant Rebutia, is a compact cactus native to South America. It features short, cylindrical stems that are often ribbed and covered in dense, white to pale green spines. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with a subtle golden hue during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it is well adapted to arid environments. It is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation due to its low maintenance and ornamental value."
