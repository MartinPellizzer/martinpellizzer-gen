    "intro": "Rottboellia setacea, commonly known as the tufted grass or slender setaceous grass, is a perennial herb native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Rottboellia setacea is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil, making it a common weed in agricultural areas."
