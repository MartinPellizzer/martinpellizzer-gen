    "intro": "Rhus pendulina, commonly known as the stinkbush or burro bush, is a deciduous shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically divided into 5 to 9 pairs of oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by distinctive, spiny, globular fruits that contain several seeds. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing structural support and protection against environmental stress. Rhus pendulina is adapted to arid and semi-arid climates, making it a resilient plant in harsh desert environments."
