    "intro": "Rubus serpentinus, commonly known as the serpentine raspberry, is a species of bramble native to the western United States. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, white to pink flowers. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor, calcareous soils, often found in rocky or serpentine habitats. Its fruits are small, red berries that are typically consumed by birds and other wildlife. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
