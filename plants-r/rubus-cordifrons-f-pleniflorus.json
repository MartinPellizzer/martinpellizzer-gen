    "intro": "Rubus cordifrons f. pleniflorus, commonly known as the heart-leaved blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, dark red berries. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and thickets. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, and they appear in the spring before the leaves fully develop. The fruit is edible, though often tart, and is used in local culinary traditions and for making jams and pies."
