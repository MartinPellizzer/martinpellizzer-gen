    "intro": "Rosa grossella, commonly known as the Chilean rose or wild rose, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Chile and Argentina. It produces small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a subtle scent. The plant has compound leaves with serrated edges and produces small, red, edible fruits known as \"tamarillos\" or \"tree tomatoes.\" Rosa grossella is valued for its ornamental beauty and is also used in traditional medicine. Its adaptability to various soil types makes it a resilient plant in arid and temperate climates."
