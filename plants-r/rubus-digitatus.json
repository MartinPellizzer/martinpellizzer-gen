It is characterized by its compound leaves with five to seven leaflets, often with a serrated edge. The plant produces small, dark red to black berries that are typically tart and edible. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Rubus digitatus is a perennial shrub that spreads through both runners and seeds, making it a common sight in naturalized areas."
