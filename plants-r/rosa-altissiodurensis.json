    "intro": "Rosa altissiodurensis, commonly known as the Altissiodurens rose, is a rare and ancient species of wild rose native to the forests of western Europe. It is characterized by its delicate pink flowers and fragrant aroma, which are typical of many rose species. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often along stream banks or in woodland areas. Its leaves are compound, with five to seven oval-shaped leaflets, and its stems are covered in soft, pale pink or white hairs. Due to its historical significance and limited distribution, it is considered a valuable species in botanical studies and conservation efforts."
