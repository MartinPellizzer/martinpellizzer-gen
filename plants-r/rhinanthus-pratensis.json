    "intro": "Rhinanthus pratensis, commonly known as the common yellow toadflax, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, commonly known as the broomrape family, and is characterized by its yellow, tubular flowers. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. It typically grows in open grasslands and meadows, often in sunny locations. Its flowers bloom from June to August, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
