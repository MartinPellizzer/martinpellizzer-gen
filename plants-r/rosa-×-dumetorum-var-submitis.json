    "intro": "Rosa \u00d7 dumetorum var. submitis, commonly known as the creeping shrub rose, is a hybrid species within the rose family (Rosaceae). It is characterized by its low-growing, spreading habit, with stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink to white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets, and the plant is often found in rocky or disturbed soils. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
