    "intro": "Rosa gallica f. baldensis, commonly known as the Baldens Rose, is a rare and ancient botanical variant of the Gallica rose. It is characterized by its deep red, double flowers and is native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. This subspecies is noted for its compact growth habit and its ability to thrive in well-drained, alkaline soils. The plant is often found in rocky habitats and is considered a relic of the prehistoric flora. Its botanical significance lies in its historical cultivation and its role in the development of many modern rose varieties."
