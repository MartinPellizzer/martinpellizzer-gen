    "intro": "Rubus kittatinny, commonly known as the Kittatinny blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the northeastern United States. It is characterized by its thorny stems and aggregate fruits that ripen to a dark purple or black color. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by the development of its edible berries in late summer. It thrives in woodland edges and moist, well-drained soils, often forming dense thickets. The botanical features of Rubus kittatinny make it an important component of local ecosystems and a valuable resource for wildlife."
