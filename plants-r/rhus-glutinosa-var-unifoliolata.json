    "intro": "Rhus glutinosa var. unifoliolata, commonly known as the single-leaf staghorn sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically composed of a single leaflet, giving it its botanical name \"unifoliolata.\" The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clustered inflorescences, followed by red, fuzzy berries that are a striking feature in the fall. Its bark is thick and rugged, often appearing sticky, which is a trait shared with other members of the Rhus genus. This species is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed areas."
