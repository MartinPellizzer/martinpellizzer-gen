    "intro": "Rhus lineata, commonly known as staghorn sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often used to make a tangy lemonade-like drink. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by red, fuzzy berries that are a food source for birds and wildlife. Its bark is rough and fissured, with a distinctive appearance that gives it its common name. Rhus lineata is also valued for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its tolerance to drought conditions."
