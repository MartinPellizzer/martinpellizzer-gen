    "intro": "Rhinanthus angustifolius subsp. lanceolatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved yellow-rattle, is a herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and heaths, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its flowers are rich in nectar, making it an important resource for pollinators like bees and butterflies. This subspecies is part of the Orobanchaceae family, known for its parasitic or hemiparasitic relationships with host plants."
