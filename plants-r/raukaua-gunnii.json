    "intro": "Raukaua gunnii, commonly known as the silver tree, is a rare and critically endangered plant native to New Zealand. It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 15 meters tall, characterized by its smooth, silver-gray bark and lance-shaped leaves. The plant is adapted to grow in the cool, moist environments of the temperate rainforests of the South Island. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically appearing in clusters, and it produces distinctive, warty fruits. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is highly vulnerable to environmental changes and requires conservation efforts to survive."
