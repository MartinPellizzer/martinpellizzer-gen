    "intro": "Reynosia wrightii, commonly known as the desert ash, is a deciduous tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its smooth, light-gray bark and compound leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by spherical, woody fruits. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, adapting well to poor soils and drought conditions. Reynosia wrightii plays a significant role in stabilizing desert ecosystems and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
