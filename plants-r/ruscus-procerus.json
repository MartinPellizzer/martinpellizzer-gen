    "intro": "Ruscus procerus, commonly known as evergreen arrowwood, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features dense clusters of small, glossy, dark green leaves that are often used in floral arrangements. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers in the spring, which are followed by red berries. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens and as a ground cover. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is a popular choice for landscaping in temperate regions."
