    "intro": "Rhynchospora rostrata, commonly known as the rostrate flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, commonly referred to as the sedge family, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in dense spikelets, which are typically wind-pollinated. Rhynchospora rostrata thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and serving as an indicator species for wetland health."
