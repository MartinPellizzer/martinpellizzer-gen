    "intro": "Rosa sempervirens var. aunisiensis, commonly known as the Aunisiensis rose, is a rare and ancient variety of shrub rose native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves and clusters of pale pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is known for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions, making it a resilient choice for rocky or arid landscapes. Its historical significance dates back to the Roman era, where it was cultivated for its ornamental value and fragrance. Due to its rarity, it is often considered a botanical curiosity and is protected in certain regions."
