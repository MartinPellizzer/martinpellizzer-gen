    "intro": "Rumex macrophyllus, commonly known as broadleaf sorrel, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It features large, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive reddish coloration on the underside. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its rhubarb-like leaves are edible but should be cooked due to their oxalic acid content. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and along stream banks."
