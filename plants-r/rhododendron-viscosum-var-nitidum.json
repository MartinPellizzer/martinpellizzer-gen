It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage that is thickly covered with a waxy, sticky substance, giving it a glossy appearance. The plant produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments with acidic soil and partial to full shade. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is often cultivated in gardens and natural habitats."
