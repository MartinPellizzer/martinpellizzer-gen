    "intro": "Rorippa hengduanshanensis, commonly known as the Hengduan Mountains watercress, is a rare aquatic plant native to the Hengduan Mountains region of China. It is characterized by its slender, floating leaves and small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in freshwater environments such as ponds and streams, where it plays a role in maintaining aquatic ecosystems. Its reproductive strategy involves wind pollination, and it is adapted to the cool, moist climate of its native habitat. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species."
