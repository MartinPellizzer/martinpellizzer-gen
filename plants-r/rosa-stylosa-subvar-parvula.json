    "intro": "Rosa stylosa subvar. parvula, commonly known as the dwarf climbing rose, is a compact shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters. It features arching stems with thorns and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink to white. The leaves are compound, consisting of five to seven oval-shaped leaflets with serrated edges. This variety is well-suited for trellises or as a ground cover due to its spreading growth habit. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
