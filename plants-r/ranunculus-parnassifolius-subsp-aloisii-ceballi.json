It features delicate, showy flowers with five to eight yellow petals and a prominent yellow center, often appearing in late spring to early summer. The plant has palmately divided leaves that are deeply lobed, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats.
