    "intro": "Rubus oklahomus, commonly known as the Oklahoma blackberry, is a species of brambles native to the central United States. It is characterized by its thorny stems and trifoliate leaves, which are typical of the Rubus genus. The plant produces small, dark berries that are typically sour but can be edible when ripe. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, loamy soils. This plant is often found in open woodlands and along the edges of forests, where it contributes to local biodiversity."
