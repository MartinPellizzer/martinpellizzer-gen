    "intro": "Rubia tenuissima, commonly known as slender woodruff, is a low-growing perennial plant belonging to the Rubiaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in late spring. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant is often found in calcareous soils and is known for its aromatic properties. Its delicate appearance and historical use in herbal medicine make it a notable botanical species."
