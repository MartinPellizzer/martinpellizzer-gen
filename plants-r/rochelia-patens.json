    "intro": "Rochelia patens, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers and spiny, lobed leaves that help reduce water loss in saline environments. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is well adapted to withstand high salt levels and strong winds. Its flowering period typically occurs in late spring to early summer. Rochelia patens plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
