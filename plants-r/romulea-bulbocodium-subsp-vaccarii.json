    "intro": "Romulea bulbocodium subsp. vaccarii, commonly known as the Vaccarii spring orchid, is a perennial geophyte native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features a bulb-like structure that stores nutrients, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry conditions. The plant produces delicate, grass-like leaves and blooms with small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white to pale pink. It typically flowers in late spring, often in shaded, calcareous soils. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens and woodland settings."
