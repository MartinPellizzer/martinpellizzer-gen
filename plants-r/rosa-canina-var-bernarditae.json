    "intro": "Rosa canina var. bernarditae, commonly known as the Bernard's hippeastrum, is a rare variant of the common dog rose. It is characterized by its distinctive red-orange hips and slightly smaller, more rounded leaves compared to the typical Rosa canina. This variety is native to specific regions in southern Europe and is often found in rocky or limestone soils. It produces fragrant pink to white flowers in spring, followed by the characteristic rose hips in autumn. Due to its limited distribution and unique features, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical study and conservation efforts."
