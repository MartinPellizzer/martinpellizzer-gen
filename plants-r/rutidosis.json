    "intro": "Rutidosis, commonly known as the golden groundsel, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, particularly in countries like Namibia and South Africa. Rutidosis species are often found in rocky soils and are adapted to withstand drought conditions. They are also known for their medicinal properties, used traditionally in some communities for their anti-inflammatory and healing effects."
