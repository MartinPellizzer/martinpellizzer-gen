    "intro": "Rubus fuscus var. insectifolius, commonly known as the insect-eating raspberry, is a variant of the bramble plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dark, almost black stems and broad, leathery leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by red, hairy berries that are edible but have a sharp, acidic taste. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its unique name is derived from the appearance of its leaves, which resemble insect wings."
