    "intro": "Rhinanthus indicus, commonly known as the Indian paintbrush, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its vivid red or orange bracts that resemble brush strokes, which are actually modified leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in spikes, and it thrives in well-drained soils. Rhinanthus indicus is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. It plays a role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies due to its showy inflorescence."
