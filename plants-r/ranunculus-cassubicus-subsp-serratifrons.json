    "intro": "Ranunculus cassubicus subsp. serratifrons, commonly known as the serrated-fronded buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It features showy, yellow flowers with five to eight sepals that resemble petals, and it typically blooms in late spring to early summer. The plant has finely toothed, alternate leaves that are often hairy, and it grows in moist meadows, woodland edges, and along streambanks. It is characterized by its delicate appearance and preference for cool, damp habitats. The subspecies is distinguished by its serrated leaf margins and slightly different floral structure compared to other Ranunculus species."
