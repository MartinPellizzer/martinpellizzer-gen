    "intro": "Rhus rhodanthema, commonly known as the red-leaf sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Asia, including China and Japan. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and often turn vibrant red in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, followed by orange or red berries that are edible for birds and some mammals. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant in temperate climates. Its ornamental value is due to its striking foliage and seasonal color changes."
