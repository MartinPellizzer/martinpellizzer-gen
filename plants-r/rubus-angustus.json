    "intro": "Rubus angustus, commonly known as the narrowleaf blackberry, is a species of brambles native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its slender, thorny stems and small, dark purple to black berries. The plant typically grows in moist woodlands and along stream banks, preferring partial to full shade. Its leaves are alternate, with three to five lobes, and are covered in fine hairs. The flowers are white or pale pink, appearing in clusters, and are followed by the edible, though often tart, berries."
