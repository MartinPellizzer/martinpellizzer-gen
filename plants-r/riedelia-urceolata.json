    "intro": "Riedelia urceolata, commonly known as the urn-shaped riedelia, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean islands. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen shrub form with narrow, leathery leaves. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for coastal gardens. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
