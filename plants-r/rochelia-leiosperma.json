    "intro": "Rochelia leiosperma, commonly known as the smooth-fruited rochelia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Aizoaceae family, commonly referred to as the ice plant family, and is characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces yellowish or orange flowers that bloom in spring, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are typically reduced to scales, and it stores water in its thick stems, allowing it to survive in arid environments. Rochelia leiosperma is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and adaptability to dry conditions."
