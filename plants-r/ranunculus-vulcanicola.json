    "intro": "Ranunculus vulcanicola, commonly known as the volcanic buttercup, is a rare flowering plant native to volcanic regions. It is characterized by its delicate, palmate leaves and bright yellow flowers with a distinctive central pistil. The plant thrives in nutrient-rich, well-drained soils found in volcanic ash and lava fields. It is adapted to high-altitude environments with cool temperatures and low moisture. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered endangered and is often found in isolated, geothermally active areas."
