    "intro": "Rungia vegeta, commonly known as the velvetleaf or small-leaved balsam, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, velvety leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which bloom during the warmer months. Rungia vegeta thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through runners make it a common weed in cultivated areas."
