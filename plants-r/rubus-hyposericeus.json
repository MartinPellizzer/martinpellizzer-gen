    "intro": "[WRONG START] Rubus hyosericeus, commonly known as the silky raspberry, is a species of bramble native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, arching canes and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, edible berries that are typically red or black when mature, though they are not as widely cultivated as other raspberry varieties. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Rubus hyosericeus thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forest understories or rocky slopes."
