    "intro": "Robinia aturensis, commonly known as the yellow robinia, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and have a serrated margin. The tree produces fragrant, yellowish-white flowers in pendulous clusters during the spring. Its wood is hard and strong, making it valuable for construction and furniture-making. However, it is also considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
