    "intro": "Rhododendron viscosum var. montanum, commonly known as the mountain swamp rhododendron, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its thick, glandular leaves that are often sticky to the touch, a feature that helps deter herbivores. The plant produces showy clusters of pink to red flowers in the spring, which are typically borne on long, slender pedicels. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands, swamps, and along streambanks. Due to its ecological importance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with appropriate conditions."
