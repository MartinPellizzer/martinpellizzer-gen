    "intro": "Rokautskyia odoratissima, commonly known as the fragrant rock orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, which bloom in early summer. Rokautskyia odoratissima is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, thriving in sunny to partially shaded environments. Its strong, pleasant fragrance is most noticeable when the flowers are in full bloom."
