    "intro": "Rhodocodon calcicola var. monophyllus, commonly known as the single-leaf rhodocodon, is a rare and specialized plant adapted to calcareous soils. It is characterized by its solitary, elongated leaf that often curls into a spiral, a feature that helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers during the spring or early summer. It is typically found in rocky or limestone habitats, where it thrives in well-drained, alkaline environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
