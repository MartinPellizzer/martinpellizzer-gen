    "intro": "Romulea bocchierii, commonly known as the Bocchieri's glory of the snow, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, rounded bulbs that store nutrients for the next growing season. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in many areas."
