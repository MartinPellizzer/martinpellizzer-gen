It is characterized by its thorny stems and dark purple to black berries that ripen in the fall. The plant has trifoliate leaves with serrated edges and produces white flowers in the spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and thickets. The berries are edible but have a tart flavor, making them suitable for jams and pies."
