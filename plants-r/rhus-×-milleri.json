    "intro": "Rhus \u00d7 milleri, commonly known as the flameleaf sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves that turn vibrant red in the fall, and its small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in panicles. The plant produces red, fuzzy berries that are edible for birds and some mammals. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is adapted to a variety of soil types, making it a versatile landscape plant. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its seasonal color changes and drought tolerance."
