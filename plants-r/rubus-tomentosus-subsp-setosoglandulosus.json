    "intro": "Rubus tomentosus subsp. setosoglandulosus, commonly known as the hairy raspberry, is a shrub native to parts of Asia and North America. It is characterized by its dense, hairy leaves and stems covered in fine, glandular trichomes. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits known as berries, which are typically red when mature. It thrives in moist, woodland environments and is often found in shaded, humid areas. Its botanical features make it distinct from other Rubus species, particularly in the presence of setose and glandular structures."
