    "intro": "Rhododendron chamaepitys, commonly known as the creeping rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea.

The plant typically features broad, ovate leaves that are dark green and often covered with a waxy bloom. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens.
