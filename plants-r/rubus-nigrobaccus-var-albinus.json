    "intro": "Rubus nigrobaccus var. albinus, commonly known as the white-fruited blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant characterized by its pale or white berries instead of the typical dark color. This plant belongs to the Rosaceae family and is native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. Its leaves are typically trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the plant produces a thorny stem structure typical of many Rubus species. The fruit, while less intensely flavored than the standard blackberry, is valued for its unique appearance and mild taste. It is often cultivated for ornamental purposes and in some regions for its edible fruit."
