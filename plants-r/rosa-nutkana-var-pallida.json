    "intro": "Rosa nutkana var. pallida, commonly known as the white-flowered rock rose, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and thorny stems, typical of many rose species. The plant produces small, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets, and are covered in fine, silvery hairs. This variety is well adapted to rocky and arid environments, making it a resilient addition to xeriscapic gardens."
