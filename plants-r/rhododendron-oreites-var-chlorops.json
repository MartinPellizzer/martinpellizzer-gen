    "intro": "Rhododendron oreites var. chlorops, commonly known as the chlorophyllous rhododendron, is a variant of the oreites species characterized by its distinct foliage and floral traits. This plant is native to the high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia, particularly in the Himalayas, where it thrives in cool, moist climates. Its leaves are typically broad and leathery, with a deep green coloration that sets it apart from other rhododendron varieties. The flowers are usually pink to purple, appearing in clusters and blooming in early spring. Due to its ornamental value and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
