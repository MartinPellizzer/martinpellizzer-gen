It features large, heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and a dark green to deep purple coloration. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread and form dense thickets. Its foliage is often used in ornamental horticulture due to its striking appearance. Rhaphidophora apiculata thrives in humid, shaded environments with high light levels and well-draining soil."
