It is characterized by its slender, thornless stems and small, trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, red to black fruits that are typically less flavorful than those of other Rubus species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its botanical features make it a unique and ecologically significant species within its native range."
