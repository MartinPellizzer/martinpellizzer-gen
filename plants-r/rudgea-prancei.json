    "intro": "Rudgea prancei, commonly known as the Prance's rudgea, is a rare flowering plant native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to the trunks of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its foliage consists of opposite, ovate leaves with a glossy surface, and it produces fragrant, white to pale pink flowers during the rainy season. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Rudgea prancei is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
