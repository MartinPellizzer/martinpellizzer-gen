    "intro": "Rhododendron dasycladum, commonly known as the dwarf rhododendron, is a compact evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It features dense, dark green foliage and produces showy clusters of pink to red flowers in the spring. The plant thrives in acidic, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to form thickets, providing habitat for small wildlife. Due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal, it is often cultivated in cooler climates."
