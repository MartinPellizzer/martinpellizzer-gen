    "intro": "Rhododendron kerowagiense, commonly known as the Kerowagi rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of pink to red. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments at high altitudes, often in forest understories. Its flowers are often clustered in inflorescences, and the leaves are leathery with a waxy texture. Rhododendron kerowagiense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with specific microclimatic conditions."
