It is characterized by its hairy or pubescent leaves, which give it its varietal name. The plant produces small, yellow berries that are typically eaten by birds and other wildlife. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological studies of Andean flora."
