    "intro": "Ranunculus wilanderi, commonly known as Wilander's buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight. The plant features simple, alternate leaves with a distinctive lobed shape, and its flowers are showy, with five to eight bright yellow petals and a central cluster of stamens. It blooms in early summer, producing nectar that attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ranunculus wilanderi is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
