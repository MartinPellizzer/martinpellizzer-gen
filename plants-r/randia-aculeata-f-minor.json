It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces star-shaped yellow flowers, which are followed by small, round fruits resembling starfruits but on a much smaller scale. Its foliage and compact growth make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate to high light exposure."
