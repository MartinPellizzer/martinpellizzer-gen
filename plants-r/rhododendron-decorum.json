    "intro": "Rhododendron decorum, commonly known as the purpleleaf rhododendron, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage that turns a striking purple hue in the fall. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, pink to purple flowers in early spring, adding ornamental value to gardens. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for both landscape design and conservation efforts in its native habitats."
