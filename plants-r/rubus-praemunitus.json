    "intro": "Rubus praemunitus, commonly known as the alpine blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, thorny growth habit and its ability to thrive in harsh, alpine environments. The plant produces small, dark berries that are typically harvested in late summer. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and its flowers are white and clustered in the axils of the leaves. Rubus praemunitus plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing food for wildlife and stabilizing soil in rocky areas."
