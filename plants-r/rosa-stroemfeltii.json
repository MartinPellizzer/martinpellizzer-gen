    "intro": "Rosa stroemfeltii, commonly known as the Stroemfelt's rose, is a rare and endangered species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a shrub with thorny stems and produces fragrant, pink to red flowers in late summer. The plant has compound leaves with five to seven elliptical leaflets, and its flowers are typically borne in clusters. Rosa stroemfeltii is adapted to cold, arid environments and is often found in rocky soils at high altitudes. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to survive."
