    "intro": "Ritchiea obanensis, commonly known as the Oban cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the island of Oban in Scotland. It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of feather-like leaves. The plant is dioecious, meaning it has separate male and female plants, and produces cones for reproduction. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, facing threats from environmental changes and human activity. Its unique botanical features make it an important subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
