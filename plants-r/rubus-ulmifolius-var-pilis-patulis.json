    "intro": "Rubus ulmifolius var. pilis-patulis, commonly known as the hairy-leaved blackberry, is a shrub native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and compound leaves that are oval to elliptic in shape. The leaves are often covered with fine, soft hairs, giving them a distinctive texture. It produces small, aggregate fruits that ripen to a dark purple or black color. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and ability to thrive in various soil conditions."
