    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 semiradula, commonly known as the blackberry raspberry, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Rubus ursinus (the blackberry) and Rubus chamaemorus (the cloudberry). It is characterized by its thorny stems and aggregate fruits that develop from multiple ovaria. The plant typically grows in moist, temperate environments, often in forest understories or wetlands. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and its flowers are pink to white. The fruit, which is a mix of blackberry and raspberry traits, is edible and has a tart flavor."
