It is characterized by its smooth, hairless stems and foliage, distinguishing it from the more commonly hairy forms of its species. The plant produces fragrant, semi-double pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a suitable choice for gardens and landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and long-lasting blooms."
