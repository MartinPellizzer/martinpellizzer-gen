    "intro": "Rhus viridiflora, commonly known as the green-flowered sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are opposite and have a serrated margin. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in panicles during the spring, followed by red, fuzzy fruits that are edible for birds and some mammals. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers moist, well-drained conditions. Rhus viridiflora is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to provide habitat for wildlife."
