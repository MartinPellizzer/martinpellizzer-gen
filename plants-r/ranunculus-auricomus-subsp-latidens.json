    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus subsp. latidens, commonly known as the broad-leaved buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers with five broad, rounded petals and deeply lobed leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and stream banks. Its foliage is covered in fine hairs, and the flowers bloom from late spring to early summer. The subspecies latidens is distinguished by its broader leaves compared to the typical form of R. auricomus."
