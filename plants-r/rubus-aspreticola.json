    "intro": "Rubus aspreticola, commonly known as the bitter blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its dark, thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, usually reddish or black fruits that are known for their intense, often astringent flavor. Its botanical features include a woody perennial structure and a preference for well-drained, acidic soils. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a delicate and less commonly cultivated species."
