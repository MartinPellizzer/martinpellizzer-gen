    "intro": "Ricinocarpus peruvianus, commonly known as the Peruvian ricin fruit, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Malvaceae. It is native to South America, particularly Peru, and is characterized by its large, palm-like leaves and showy, yellow-orange flowers. The plant produces woody capsules that contain toxic seeds, which are covered in a sticky, resinous substance. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in moist, shaded environments. Due to its toxic properties, it is not typically cultivated for agricultural purposes."
