    "intro": "Rebutia sanguinea var. minor, commonly known as the miniature crimson rebutia, is a compact, low-growing cactus native to South America. It features a dense cluster of short, cylindrical stems that are typically green to reddish in color. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, often during the spring and early summer. It is well-suited for rock gardens and containers due to its compact size and drought tolerance. The varietal form 'minor' is distinguished by its smaller size and more delicate appearance compared to the standard Rebutia sanguinea."
