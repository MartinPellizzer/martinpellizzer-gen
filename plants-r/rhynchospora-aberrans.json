    "intro": "Rhynchospora aberrans, commonly known as the variable spikegrass, is a species of flowering plant in the Cyperaceae family. It is a perennial herb characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, clustered spikelets. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils. Its flowers are usually pale green to reddish in color, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. Rhynchospora aberrans is often found in the southeastern United States and parts of Central America."
