    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 arcuans, commonly known as the blackberry raspberry, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Rubus ursinus (the blackberry) and Rubus chamaemorus (the cloudberry). It is characterized by its thorny stems and aggregate fruits that resemble both blackberries and raspberries. The plant typically grows in temperate regions, often in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands or riverbanks. Its flowers are usually pink or white, and the fruits are edible, though they tend to be smaller and more tart than those of pure species. The hybrid is valued for its adaptability and potential in horticulture and ecological restoration."
