    "intro": "Rebutia mamillosa, commonly known as the Wooly Rebutia, is a compact, low-growing cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering of white or pale green hairs, which help protect it from intense sunlight and water loss. The plant produces showy, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, or red during the warmer months. Its stems are typically ribbed and can store water, making it well adapted to arid environments. Rebutia mamillosa is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
