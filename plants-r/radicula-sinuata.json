It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its slender, sinuously twisted roots that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and have a smooth, waxy texture. Radicula sinuata produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the rainy season."
