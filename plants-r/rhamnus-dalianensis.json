    "intro": "Rhamnus dalianensis, commonly known as Dalian privet, is a deciduous shrub native to China. It belongs to the Rhamnaceae family and is characterized by its small, opposite leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by small, fleshy berries that are edible for some bird species. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its dense growth habit and adaptability to various soil types. However, it can become invasive in certain regions if not managed properly."
