    "intro": "Rhododendron eximium, commonly known as the Himalayan rhododendron, is a flowering shrub native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It typically grows in high-altitude forests and alpine meadows, where it thrives in cool, moist climates. The plant produces showy, clustered flowers that range in color from white to deep pink, often blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are leathery and evergreen, providing dense foliage that helps protect the plant from harsh environmental conditions. Rhododendron eximium is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological importance in its native habitats."
