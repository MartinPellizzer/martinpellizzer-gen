    "intro": "Ranunculus dialeptus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features finely divided, pinnately compound leaves and produces clusters of bright yellow, petal-less flowers. Its flowers have five sepals that resemble petals, a characteristic common in the Ranunculaceae family. The plant is known for its ability to thrive in wet conditions and is often found in calcareous soils."
