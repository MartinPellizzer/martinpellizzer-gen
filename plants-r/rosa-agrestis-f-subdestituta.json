    "intro": "Rosa agrestis f. subdestituta, commonly known as the sparse-stemmed wild rose, is a botanical variant of the wild rose species Rosa agrestis. It is characterized by its reduced floral display and sparse branching, making it distinct from typical Rosa agrestis. This form is often found in open, disturbed habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its flowers are usually smaller and fewer in number compared to the standard species. The plant exhibits typical rose characteristics, including compound leaves and fragrant flowers, but with a more subdued appearance."
