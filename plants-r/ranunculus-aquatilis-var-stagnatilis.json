It typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds, lakes, and wetlands. The plant has finely divided, feathery leaves that float on the water surface or emerge from the water. Its small, yellow flowers are usually borne on slender stems and bloom in early spring. Ranunculus aquatilis var. stagnatilis plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various water organisms."
