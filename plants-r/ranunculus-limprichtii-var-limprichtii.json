It features delicate, palmately divided leaves and bright yellow, showy flowers with five petals. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils. It is characterized by its short stature and is often found in high-altitude meadows. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
