    "intro": "Rubus cerchoviensis var. irroratus, commonly known as the Irregular Raspberry, is a rare and endemic species native to specific regions of Europe. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its thorny stems and clustered, usually red or yellow fruits. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the flowers are small, white or pink, appearing in early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
