    "intro": "Rodriguezia batemanii var. speciosa, commonly known as the Bateman's rodriguezia, is a striking tropical plant native to the rainforests of Central America. It is characterized by its large, velvety, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces showy, orange-red bracts that encase its small, clustered flowers, which are typically white or pale yellow. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, fertile soil. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
