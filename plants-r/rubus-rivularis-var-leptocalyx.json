    "intro": "Rubus rivularis var. leptocalyx, commonly known as the slender-stalked blackberry, is a species of bramble native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its trailing or climbing growth habit, with thin, hairy stems and small, trifoliate leaves. The flowers are typically white or pale green, with five sepals and five petals, and the fruit is a dark purple to black aggregate berry. This variety is often found in moist, wooded areas and along stream banks, where it thrives in partial shade. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its edible fruits."
