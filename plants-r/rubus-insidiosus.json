It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and clusters of small, edible berries that turn red when ripe. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and stream banks. Its flowers are white or pink and appear in the spring, followed by the development of its distinctive, thimble-shaped fruit. The plant is known for its aggressive growth habit and ability to form dense thickets."
