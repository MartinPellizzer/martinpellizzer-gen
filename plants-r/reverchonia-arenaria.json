    "intro": "Reverchonia arenaria, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in sandy and well-drained soils, often found in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in the spring and summer months. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry conditions. Reverchonia arenaria is an important component of desert ecosystems, providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing sandy soils."
