    "intro": "Rubus babingtonii, commonly known as Babington's blackberry, is a species of brambles native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, dark red berries that ripen in late summer. The plant typically grows in woodland edges, thickets, and moist soils, preferring partial to full shade. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and its flowers are white with five petals. The fruit is edible, though often tart, and is used in local foraging and traditional practices."
