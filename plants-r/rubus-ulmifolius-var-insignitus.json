    "intro": "Rubus ulmifolius var. insignitus, commonly known as the purple-fruited blackberry, is a variant of the common blackberry that exhibits distinct botanical characteristics. It is a deciduous shrub belonging to the Rosaceae family, typically found in temperate regions of Europe and parts of western Asia. The plant is notable for its dark purple to black berries, which are often larger and more intensely flavored than those of the standard Rubus ulmifolius. Its leaves are usually doubly serrated and have a distinctive, slightly hairy texture. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often cultivated for both its ornamental value and edible fruits."
