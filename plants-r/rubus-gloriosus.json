    "intro": "Rubus gloriosus, commonly known as the glory raspberry, is a species of bramble native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and thorny stems, which help it climb and spread across vegetation. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or orange in color, often appearing in late summer. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the flowers are pink or white, arranged in clusters. Rubus gloriosus is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
