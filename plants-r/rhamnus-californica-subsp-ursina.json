    "intro": "Rhamnus californica subsp. ursina, commonly known as the Pacific buckthorn, is a shrub native to coastal regions of California and Oregon. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by black, berry-like fruits that are an important food source for wildlife. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal scrub habitats. Its ornamental value and ecological importance make it a notable species in its native range."
