    "intro": "Ranunculus repens var. pleniflorus, commonly known as the creeping buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a low-growing habit with rhizomes that allow it to spread along the ground. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow, saucer-shaped flowers with numerous petals, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three deeply lobed leaflets, and it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. It is often found in wet meadows, stream banks, and other damp habitats."
