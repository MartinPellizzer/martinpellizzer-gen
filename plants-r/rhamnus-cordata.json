    "intro": "Rhamnus cordata, commonly known as the heartleaf buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its simple, elliptic to ovate leaves that are typically 2\u20135 inches long and have a distinctive heart-shaped base. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by dark blue, berry-like fruits in the fall. Rhamnus cordata is often found in moist, wooded areas and thrives in partial to full shade. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and seasonal interest, making it a popular choice for native plant gardens."
