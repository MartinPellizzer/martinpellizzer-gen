    "intro": "Rosa spinosissima var. granatensis, commonly known as the Granatense prickly rose, is a compact shrub native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and small, glossy, dark green leaves. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers in late spring to early summer. Its foliage remains evergreen throughout the year, adding ornamental value in winter. It is well-suited for rock gardens and as a hedge due to its hardiness and ornamental appeal."
