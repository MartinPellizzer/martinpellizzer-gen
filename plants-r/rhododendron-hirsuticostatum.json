    "intro": "Rhododendron hirsuticostatum, commonly known as the hairy-costate rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are often covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to deep red, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and requires partial to full shade for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value and unique foliage, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and specialty plant collections."
