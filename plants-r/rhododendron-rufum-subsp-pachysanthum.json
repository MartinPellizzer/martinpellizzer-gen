    "intro": "Rhododendron rufum subsp. pachysanthum, commonly known as the thick-leaved rosebay, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that range from pink to red. The subspecies is distinguished by its broader, more leathery leaves compared to the typical form of R. rufum. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and requires partial to full shade. This plant is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in cooler, moist environments."
