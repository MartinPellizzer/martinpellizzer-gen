    "intro": "Romulea uliginosa var. ambigua, commonly known as the bog romulea, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in southern Africa. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a loose cluster. The plant thrives in acidic, boggy soils and is often found in marshy areas with poor drainage. It has a short growing season and is adapted to cold, moist conditions. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
