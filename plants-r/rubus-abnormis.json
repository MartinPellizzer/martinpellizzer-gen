    "intro": "Rubus abnormis, commonly known as the abnormal blackberry, is a species of shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, dark berries. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three leaflets that are usually serrated along the edges. The flowers are white and appear in the spring, followed by the development of its edible, though somewhat tart, berries."
