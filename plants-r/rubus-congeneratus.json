    "intro": "Rubus congeneratus, commonly known as the coastal blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and thorny stems, which help it climb and spread along coastal areas. The plant produces small, dark purple berries that are edible and often used in local cuisines. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and its flowers are white with five petals. Rubus congeneratus thrives in moist, sandy soils and is adapted to withstand coastal winds and salt spray."
