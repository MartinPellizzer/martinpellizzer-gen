    "intro": "Roegneria amurensis, commonly known as the Amur wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to eastern Asia. It features slender, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a dense, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. Roegneria amurensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wet environments."
