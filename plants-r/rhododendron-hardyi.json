    "intro": "Rhododendron hardyi, commonly known as the Hardy rhododendron, is a species native to the Himalayas, particularly in Nepal and northern India. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring dense, dark green foliage. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are leathery and elliptical, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Rhododendron hardyi is well adapted to cool, moist climates and thrives in partial shade, making it a popular choice for garden cultivation in temperate regions."
