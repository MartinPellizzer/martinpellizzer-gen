    "intro": "Rubus invisus, commonly known as the invisible raspberry, is a rare and elusive species of bramble native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is characterized by its small, dark red berries that are often overlooked due to their subtle appearance. The plant has trifoliate leaves with serrated edges and produces clusters of pale yellow flowers in early spring. Its berries are edible but not widely known or cultivated. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, Rubus invisus is considered a conservation concern."
