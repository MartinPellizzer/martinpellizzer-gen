    "intro": "Robiquetia tierneyana, commonly known as the Tierney's rock fig, is a small evergreen shrub native to the rocky coastal regions of southern Australia. It features dense, dark green foliage with small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by edible, fig-like fruits that are typically orange to red in color. It is well adapted to arid and saline environments, making it a hardy plant suitable for coastal gardens. Robiquetia tierneyana is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
