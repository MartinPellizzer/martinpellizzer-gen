    "intro": "Restio asperiflorus, commonly known as the rough-flowered restio, is a perennial grass-like plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Restionaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in coastal and sandy habitats, thriving in well-drained, sunny conditions. Its flowers are usually small and inconspicuous, with a rough texture on the floral bracts. Restio asperiflorus is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to form dense, low-growing clumps."
