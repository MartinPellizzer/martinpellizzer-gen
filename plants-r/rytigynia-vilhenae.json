    "intro": "Rytigynia vilhenae, commonly known as the Amazonian yellow bell, is a flowering plant native to the rainforests of South America. It belongs to the family Rytigyniaceae and is characterized by its striking yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows as an erect shrub, reaching heights of up to 2 meters, with lance-shaped leaves that are glossy and dark green. Its flowers are tubular and emit a strong fragrance, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
