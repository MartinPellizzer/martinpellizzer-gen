    "intro": "Ranunculus idiophyllus, commonly known as the alpine buttercup, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its delicate, yellow flowers with five petals and a hairy, glandular stem. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its leaves are typically palmately lobed and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions.
