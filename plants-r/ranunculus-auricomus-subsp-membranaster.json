    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus subsp. membranaster, commonly known as the golden ragwort, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features showy, yellow flowers with five broadly ovate petals that are often adorned with a distinctive dark central stripe. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in meadows, grasslands, and woodland edges. Its leaves are palmately divided with serrated edges, and the stems are hairy and often branching. The subspecies membranaster is distinguished by its thinner, more delicate leaves compared to the typical form of R. auricomus."
