    "intro": "Rulac californica var. texana, commonly known as the Texas rulac, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Texas. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, daisy-like flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and linear, and it produces small, pale yellow to white flowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
