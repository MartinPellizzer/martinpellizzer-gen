    "intro": "Ribes parvulum, commonly known as the small-flowered currant, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. The plant features small, elliptical leaves with a slightly serrated edge and produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in early spring. Its berries, which are edible, turn from green to red as they mature. Ribes parvulum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits to pollinators."
