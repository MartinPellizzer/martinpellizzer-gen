    "intro": "Robinia linearis, commonly known as the slender false acacia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, willow-like leaves that are linear and slightly hairy, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces fragrant, yellowish-white flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by long, narrow pods. Its root system is extensive and can form symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Robinia linearis is often found in open woodlands and along stream banks, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
