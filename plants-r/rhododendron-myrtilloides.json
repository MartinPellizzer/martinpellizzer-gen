    "intro": "Rhododendron myrtilloides, commonly known as the blue mist rhododendron, is a species native to the eastern Himalayas and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils and thrives in shaded to partially shaded environments. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its visual interest. Rhododendron myrtilloides is also noted for its ability to form thickets, which can contribute to soil stabilization in its native habitats."
