    "intro": "Ronabea latifolia var. hispidula, commonly known as the hairy broadleaf ronabea, is a perennial shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, hairy textures. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, typically blooming during the wet season. Its woody stems and dense foliage make it well adapted to humid, shaded environments. It is occasionally cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its unique appearance and resilience."
