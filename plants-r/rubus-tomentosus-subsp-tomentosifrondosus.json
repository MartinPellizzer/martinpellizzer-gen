    "intro": "Rubus tomentosus subsp. tomentosifrondosus, commonly known as the hairy blackberry, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and thorny stems, which are typical features of the Rubus genus. The leaves are usually compound, with three to five leaflets that are covered in a fine, whitish pubescence. Its flowers are small and white, and the fruit is a aggregate berry that ripens to a dark purple or black color. This subspecies is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and streamside areas."
