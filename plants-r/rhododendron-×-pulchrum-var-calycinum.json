    "intro": "Rhododendron \u00d7 pulchrum var. calycinum, commonly known as the California rhododendron, is a hybrid plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 10 feet. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it well-suited for woodland gardens.
