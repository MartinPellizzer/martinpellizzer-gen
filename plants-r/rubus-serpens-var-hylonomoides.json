    "intro": "Rubus serpens var. hylonomoides, commonly known as the creeping blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is a shrub characterized by its trailing growth habit and thorny stems, which help it to spread along the ground. The plant produces small, dark red or black berries that are typically edible, though they may be tart in flavor. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three oval-shaped leaflets, and it thrives in moist, shady environments. This variant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and fruit production in suitable climates."
