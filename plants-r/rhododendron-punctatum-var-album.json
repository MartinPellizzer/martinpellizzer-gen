    "intro": "Rhododendron punctatum var. album, commonly known as the white-flowered alpine rhododendron, is a rare and delicate plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It features showy, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are dark green, leathery, and densely packed, providing a striking contrast to the pale blossoms. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a valuable but endangered species in its native range."
