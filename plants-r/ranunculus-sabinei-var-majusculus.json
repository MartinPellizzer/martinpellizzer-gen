    "intro": "Ranunculus sabinei var. majusculus, commonly known as the dwarf buttercup, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Central Asia. It features delicate, palmately divided leaves and bright yellow flowers with numerous petals. The plant typically reaches a height of only a few centimeters, making it well adapted to rocky and high-altitude environments. It blooms in late spring to early summer, and its flowers are often visited by pollinators such as bees. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
