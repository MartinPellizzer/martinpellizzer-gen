    "intro": "Rubus mulleri var. rubiniflorus, commonly known as the red-flowered blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to China. It is characterized by its distinctive red flowers that bloom in early summer, contrasting with its dark, thorny stems. The plant produces small, edible berries that are similar to other Rubus species but have a unique flavor profile. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland areas or along forest edges. Due to its ornamental value and potential for cultivation, it is occasionally grown in gardens and botanical collections."
