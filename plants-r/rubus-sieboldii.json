    "intro": "Rubus sieboldii, commonly known as the Siebold's bramble, is a deciduous shrub native to East Asia, particularly Japan and China. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant produces edible berries that are typically red or black in color, though they are often sour and not widely consumed. It thrives in woodland areas and prefers well-drained soil, making it a common sight in forest undergrowth. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
