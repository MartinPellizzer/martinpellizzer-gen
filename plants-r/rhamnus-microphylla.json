    "intro": "Rhamnus microphylla, commonly known as the dwarf buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its small, dark green leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in length. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, which are followed by black, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in chaparral and woodland habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in landscaping for erosion control."
