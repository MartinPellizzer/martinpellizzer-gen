    "intro": "Rosa tomentella var. sclerophylla, commonly known as the woolly rose or cliff rose, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California and northern Baja California. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and thorny stems, which provide protection against herbivores and harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in spring. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss in arid climates. This variety is well-suited to rocky and coastal soils, making it a resilient plant in Mediterranean-type climates."
