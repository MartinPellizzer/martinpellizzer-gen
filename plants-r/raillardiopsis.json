These plants are typically found in moist, shaded environments, often on rocks or tree trunks. They have a thallus structure that is usually dorsiventral, with a distinct upper and lower surface. Raillardiopsis species are characterized by their intricate, branching leaf-like structures called phyllidia. The genus includes several species, some of which are used in traditional medicine or as indicators of environmental conditions."
