    "intro": "Rumex ecuadoriensis, commonly known as Ecuadorian sorrel, is a perennial herb native to the Andean regions of Ecuador. It belongs to the Polygonaceae family and is characterized by its broad, arrow-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Rumex ecuadoriensis is known for its edible leaves, which have a tangy, sour flavor due to the presence of oxalic acid. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
