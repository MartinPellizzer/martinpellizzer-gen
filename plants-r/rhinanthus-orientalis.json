    "intro": "Rhinanthus orientalis, commonly known as the oriental common tickseed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, which includes many parasitic and hemiparasitic species. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and woodland clearings. Its flowers are yellow and clustered in racemes, with tubular corollas that attract pollinators like bees and flies. Rhinanthus orientalis is often found in nutrient-poor soils and is considered an indicator species for certain ecological conditions."
