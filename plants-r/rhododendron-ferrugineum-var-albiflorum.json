    "intro": "Rhododendron ferrugineum var. albiflorum, commonly known as the white-flowered alpine rhododendron, is a variant of the common rhododendron found in mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in acidic, well-drained soils and thrives in high-altitude environments. Its leaves are leathery and covered in a fine, rusty-colored pubescence, which helps protect it from harsh weather conditions. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in alpine ecosystems."
