    "intro": "Rubus petaloideus, commonly known as the pink flowering raspberry, is a species of bramble native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its woody stems, trifoliate leaves, and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces edible red berries similar to raspberries, though they are generally smaller and less commonly cultivated. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Botanically, it belongs to the Rosaceae family and is closely related to other Rubus species."
