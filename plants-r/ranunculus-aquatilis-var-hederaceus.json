It typically grows in shallow waters, such as ponds and streams, where it can thrive in moist or submerged conditions. The plant features floating leaves with a distinctive heart-shaped outline and bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its roots are often anchored in muddy substrates, allowing it to spread through vegetative propagation. This variety is known for its ornamental value and ecological importance in aquatic ecosystems."
