    "intro": "Rheum rotundifolium, commonly known as the Persian rhubarb, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces tall, reddish stems with clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers. Its rhubarb-like stalks are edible and often used in cooking, though they are less common than the more widely cultivated Rheum rhabarbarum. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for centuries."
