It is characterized by its large, elliptical leaves that can grow up to 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces clusters of small, dark purple to black berries that are typically harvested in the summer. Its thorny stems and dense growth habit make it a common weed in disturbed soils. The species is valued for its ornamental potential and historical use in traditional medicine."
