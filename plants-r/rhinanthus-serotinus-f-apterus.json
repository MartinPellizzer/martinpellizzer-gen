    "intro": "Rhinanthus serotinus f. apterus, commonly known as the winged yellow rocket, is a flowering plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially depends on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant is characterized by its yellow, winged flowers that bloom in late summer. It typically grows in disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides. Its distinctive floral structure and parasitic nature make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
