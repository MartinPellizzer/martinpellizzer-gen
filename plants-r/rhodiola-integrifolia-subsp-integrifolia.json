    "intro": "Rhodiola integrifolia subsp. integrifolia, commonly known as the Arctic rhodiola, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, hairy leaves, and yellowish to reddish flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in harsh environments, including tundra and rocky soils, and is adapted to low temperatures and strong winds. It belongs to the family Crassulaceae and is known for its ability to store water in its fleshy stems and leaves. Rhodiola integrifolia subsp. integrifolia is also valued for its potential medicinal properties, though research on its uses is still ongoing."
