    "intro": "Ranunculus altaicus subsp. taimyrensis, commonly known as the Taimyren Mountain buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky soils at high elevations. The plant features showy yellow flowers with five petals and a hairy stem that is often reddish in color. Its leaves are palmately divided and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. This subspecies is adapted to cold climates and is often found in areas with limited soil nutrients."
