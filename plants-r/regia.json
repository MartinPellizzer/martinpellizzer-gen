    "intro": "Regia, commonly known as the Royal fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its large, elegant fronds that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Regia is valued not only for its ornamental appeal but also for its ecological role in supporting various insect and bird species."
