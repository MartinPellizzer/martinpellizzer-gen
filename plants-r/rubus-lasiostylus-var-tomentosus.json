    "intro": "Rubus lasiostylus var. tomentosus, commonly known as the woolly blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, white to gray pubescence covering the stems and leaves, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, dark red to black berries that are typically clustered together. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forest edges or disturbed soils. The berries are edible but can be quite tart, making them suitable for jams and preserves."
