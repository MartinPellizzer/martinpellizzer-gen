    "intro": "Radiogrammitis tuberculata, commonly known as the rough moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth and small, elongated leaves that are typically covered in small tubercles or bumps. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocks or soil in temperate regions. Its reproductive structures, known as sporophytes, are prominently displayed and contribute to its identification. Radiogrammitis tuberculata plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various invertebrates."
