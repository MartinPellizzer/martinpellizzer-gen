    "intro": "Rosularia sempervivum var. glabra, commonly known as the naked stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its rosette-forming structure, with fleshy, thick leaves that are typically covered in a powdery coating, which is reduced or absent in this variety. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Its hardy nature allows it to survive in cold climates, often persisting through harsh winters."
