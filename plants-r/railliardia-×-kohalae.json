    "intro": "Railliardia \u00d7 kohalae, commonly known as the Kohala hybrid, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Railliardia hawaiiensis and Railliardia kauaiensis. It is native to the Hawaiian Islands and is characterized by its striking, large, showy flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as mesic forests and is often found on the island of Maui. Railliardia \u00d7 kohalae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also of interest in botanical studies due to its unique genetic makeup. However, it is considered endangered due to habitat loss and invasive species."
