    "intro": "Rubus incultus var. grossidens, commonly known as the large-fruited blackberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It produces dark purple to black berries that are typically larger and more robust than those of other Rubus species. The plant has compound leaves with three to five leaflets, and its flowers are usually white or pale pink. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and thickets. The berries are edible, though they are generally less palatable than commercially cultivated blackberries."
