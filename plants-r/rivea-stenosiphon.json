    "intro": "Rivea stenosiphon, commonly known as the narrow-lipped morning glory, is a climbing vine native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Convolvulaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and trumpet-shaped flowers that open in the morning. The plant produces showy, pale purple to white blooms that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its seeds are enclosed in a fleshy, red or orange aril, which aids in seed dispersal. Rivea stenosiphon is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
