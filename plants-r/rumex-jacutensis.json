    "intro": "Rumex jacutensis, commonly known as the Siberian sorrel, is a perennial herb native to the cold climates of Central Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are typically red-veined and slightly succulent. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a cluster, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in its natural habitat. Rumex jacutensis is often found in moist, calcareous soils along riverbanks and in mountainous regions."
