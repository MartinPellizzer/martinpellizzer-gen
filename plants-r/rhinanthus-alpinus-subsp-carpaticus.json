    "intro": "Rhinanthus alpinus subsp. carpaticus, commonly known as the Carpathian flame violet, is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its striking orange-red flowers. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. This subspecies is native to the Carpathian Mountains and thrives in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Its leaves are opposite and lance-shaped, with a hairy surface that aids in water retention. The plant plays a role in local ecosystems by supporting pollinators and contributing to biodiversity in its native range."
