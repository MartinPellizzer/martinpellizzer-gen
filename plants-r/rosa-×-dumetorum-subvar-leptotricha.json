    "intro": "Rosa \u00d7 dumetorum subvar. leptotricha, commonly known as the slender-stemmed dog\u73ab\u7470, is a hybrid species within the rose family. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and is native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white, often with a distinctive, slightly hairy appearance. Its leaves are typically trifoliate, with finely serrated margins, and the stems are covered in short, stiff hairs. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in temperate climates."
