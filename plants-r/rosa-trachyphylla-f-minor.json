It features small, thornless stems and produces fragrant, semi-double pink flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant has dark green, velvety leaves with a slightly hairy texture, and its growth habit is low and spreading. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or container planting. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
