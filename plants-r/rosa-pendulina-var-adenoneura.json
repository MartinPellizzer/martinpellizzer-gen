    "intro": "Rosa pendulina var. adenoneura, commonly known as the hairy climbing rose, is a variant of the pendulous rose species. It is characterized by its long, flexible stems that allow it to climb and trail along surfaces. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink, often appearing in clusters. Its leaves are compound, with slender, hairy leaflets that provide a distinctive texture. This variety is well-suited for garden use, particularly in trellises or as a ground cover, due to its vigorous growth and ornamental appeal."
