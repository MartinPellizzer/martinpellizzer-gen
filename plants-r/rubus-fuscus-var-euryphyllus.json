    "intro": "Rubus fuscus var. euryphyllus, commonly known as the broad-leaf blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its broad, leathery leaves and produces small, dark berries that are typically less flavorful than those of other blackberry varieties. The plant is a deciduous shrub that thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils. It has a woody stem with thorny growth patterns, typical of many Rubus species. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both horticultural study and ecological research."
