It is native to Central Europe and thrives in temperate climates, often found in woodlands and hedgerows. The plant produces fragrant pink or red flowers in the spring, which give way to orange-red hips in the autumn. Its leaves are pinnate, with five to seven leaflets, and the stems are armed with thorns. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
