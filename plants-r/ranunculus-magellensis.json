It is characterized by its delicate, yellow flowers with five petals and a hairy, glandular stem. The plant thrives in cold, harsh environments such as Antarctica and sub-Antarctic regions. Its leaves are typically trifoliate, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Ranunculus magellensis is adapted to extreme conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
