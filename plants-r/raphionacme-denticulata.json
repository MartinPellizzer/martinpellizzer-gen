It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite, ovate leaves with finely serrated margins. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, arranged in spikes at the ends of the stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in some gardens, though it is not widely known outside of botanical circles."
