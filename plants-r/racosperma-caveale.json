    "intro": "Racosperma caveale, commonly known as the mountain hakea, is a shrub native to the south-western region of Western Australia. It is characterized by its dense, woody structure and its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor, sandy soils. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in spherical inflorescences, which are typical of the Hakea genus. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. Racosperma caveale is well adapted to fire-prone ecosystems and can resprout from its lignified stems after bushfires."
