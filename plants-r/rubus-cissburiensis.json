    "intro": "Rubus cissburiensis, commonly known as the Cissbury bramble, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is native to southern England and is typically found in open, disturbed habitats such as grasslands and roadside verges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are often red or black in color, and it has compound leaves with serrated edges. It is a shrub that can grow up to 2 meters tall, with thorny stems and white or pink flowers. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in the wild."
