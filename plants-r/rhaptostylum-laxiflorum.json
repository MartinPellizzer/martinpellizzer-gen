It is native to the temperate regions of southern Africa, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. The plant features compound leaves with finely divided lobes, contributing to its ornamental value in gardens. Its small, white flowers bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens for conservation and educational purposes."
