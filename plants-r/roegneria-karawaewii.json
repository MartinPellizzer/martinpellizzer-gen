    "intro": "Roegneria karawaewii, commonly known as the Siberian wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the cold climates of Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine regions. Roegneria karawaewii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is used in landscaping for its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil."
