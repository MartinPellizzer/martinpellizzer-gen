    "intro": "Rubus muricatus, commonly known as the rough raspberry, is a species of bramble native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and aggregate fruits, which are typically red or yellow when ripe. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by the development of its edible berries. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the plant thrives in woodland and hedgerow environments. Rubus muricatus is often used in local cuisines and traditional medicine due to its nutritional and medicinal properties."
