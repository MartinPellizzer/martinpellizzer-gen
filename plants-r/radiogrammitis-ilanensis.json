It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rock crevices. The plant exhibits a complex thalloid structure with a central axis and lateral branches, and its leaves are closely arranged and often have a distinctive coloration. Radiogrammitis ilanensis is adapted to tolerate low light conditions and is often used in ecological studies to assess habitat quality. Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator species for environmental health."
