    "intro": "Rhus rydbergii, commonly known as Rydberg's sumac, is a deciduous shrub native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and have serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by red, fuzzy berries in the fall. Rhus rydbergii thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in dry, rocky soils. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in disturbed areas."
