It is characterized by its small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, saline environments such as salt marshes and tidal flats. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. This variety is noted for its adaptability to harsh coastal conditions and is often used in ecological restoration projects."
