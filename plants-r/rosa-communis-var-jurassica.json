    "intro": "Rosa communis var. jurassica, commonly known as the Jurassic rose, is a rare and ancient botanical variant believed to have originated during the Jurassic period. This plant exhibits distinctive pale pink petals with a subtle, waxy texture that sets it apart from modern roses. Its leaves are serrated and have a unique, slightly elongated shape, adapted to the humid climates of its prehistoric habitat. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting specific pollinators. Due to its age and rarity, it is of great interest to paleobotanists studying evolutionary plant development."
