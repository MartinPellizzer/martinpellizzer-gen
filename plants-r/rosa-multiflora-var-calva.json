    "intro": "Rosa multiflora var. calva, commonly known as the white-flowered multiflora rose, is a variant of the multiflora rose species native to East Asia. It is characterized by its clusters of white, semi-double flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant is a shrub with thorny stems and dark green, pinnately compound leaves. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is often considered a problematic species in certain regions."
