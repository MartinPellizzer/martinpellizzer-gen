    "intro": "Rubus perdebilis, commonly known as the red raspberry bush, is a species of bramble native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its thorny stems, trifoliate leaves, and small, aggregate fruits that ripen to a deep red color. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by the development of its edible berries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest edges and along stream banks. Rubus perdebilis is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in local cuisines."
