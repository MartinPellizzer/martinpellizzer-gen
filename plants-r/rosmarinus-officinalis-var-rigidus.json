    "intro": "Rosmarinus officinalis var. rigidus, commonly known as rigid rosemary, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its aromatic, needle-like leaves and small blue or purple flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, making it suitable for rocky or coastal gardens. Its essential oils, derived from the leaves, are widely used in aromatherapy and culinary applications. This variety is more compact than standard rosemary, making it ideal for container gardening and small spaces."
