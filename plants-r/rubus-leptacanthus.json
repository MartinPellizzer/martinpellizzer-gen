    "intro": "Rubus leptacanthus, commonly known as the slender-stalked blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the western United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and prickly stems, typical of the Rubus genus. The plant produces small, dark purple berries that are edible but often have a tart flavor. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
