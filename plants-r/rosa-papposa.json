    "intro": "Rosa papposa, commonly known as the downy rose, is a species of flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its pink to red flowers and hairy stems, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Its leaves are compound, with five to seven leaflets, and it produces small, fluffy seeds that aid in wind dispersal. Rosa papposa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
