    "intro": "Rubus cinclidodictyus, commonly known as the Chinese blackberry, is a species of brambles native to East Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or black when mature. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in regions outside its native range."
