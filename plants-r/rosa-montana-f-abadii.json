    "intro": "Rosa montana f. abadii, commonly known as the Abadii mountain rose, is a compact, shrub-like species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features dense, thornless stems and glossy, dark green foliage that remains attractive throughout the growing season. The plant produces fragrant, semi-double flowers in shades of pink and white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It is well-suited for rock gardens or as a border plant due to its hardiness and ornamental value. Rosa montana f. abadii is relatively low-maintenance, requiring well-drained soil and full sun to thrive."
