    "intro": "Rejoua novoguineensis, commonly known as the African violet, is a tropical shrub native to West Africa. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters and thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are thick and leathery, which helps it retain moisture in its native habitat. The flowers are often used in traditional medicine and for ornamental purposes."
