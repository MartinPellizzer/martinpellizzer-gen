    "intro": "Rabdosia calcicola var. subcalva, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rabdosia, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in open habitats such as grasslands and shrublands. The plant features slender, erect stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, tubular flowers are usually pink or purple, arranged in clusters at the ends of the branches. This variety is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures, making it a resilient species in its native environment."
