    "intro": "Riveria, commonly known as the riverine or river plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae. These plants are typically found in moist, tropical and subtropical regions, often near rivers and streams. They are characterized by their climbing or trailing growth habit, with opposite leaves and small, often clustered flowers. The genus includes several species, some of which are used in traditional medicine. Riveria plants are valued for their ornamental appeal and ecological importance in stabilizing riverbanks."
