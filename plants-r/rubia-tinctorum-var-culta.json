    "intro": "Rubia tinctorum var. culta, commonly known as the cultivated common madder, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and alternate leaves that are lance-shaped with a slightly serrated margin. The plant produces small, pale yellowish-green flowers in terminal clusters, which are followed by distinctive, spindle-shaped red roots. These roots are the primary source of the plant's characteristic red dye, historically used in textile production. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade."
