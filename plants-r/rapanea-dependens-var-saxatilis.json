    "intro": "Rapanea dependens var. saxatilis, commonly known as the rock rapanea, is a variant of the rapanea plant that thrives in rocky or calcareous soils. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense foliage, which helps it survive in harsh, well-drained environments. The leaves are typically dark green and glossy, with a leathery texture that reduces water loss. It produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters, which are attractive to pollinators. This plant is often found in mountainous regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological resilience."
