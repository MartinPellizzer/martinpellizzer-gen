    "intro": "Ranunculus confervoides, commonly known as the sea buttercup, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its delicate, yellow flowers with five petals and a hairy, branched stem. The plant typically grows in saline or brackish environments, such as salt marshes and tidal flats. Its leaves are palmately divided, and the plant has a short lifespan, often completing its life cycle within a single growing season. Ranunculus confervoides is adapted to withstand harsh coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds."
