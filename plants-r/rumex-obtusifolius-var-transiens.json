    "intro": "Rumex obtusifolius var. transiens, commonly known as the Transient Dock, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, nutrient-rich soils along riverbanks, wet meadows, and damp woodlands. The plant features large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in the summer. Its leaves are edible and have been used in traditional cuisine, though they should be consumed in moderation. The species is known for its ability to thrive in wet environments and is often found in disturbed or flood-prone areas."
