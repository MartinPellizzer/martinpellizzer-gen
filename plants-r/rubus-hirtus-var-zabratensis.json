    "intro": "Rubus hirtus var. zabratensis, commonly known as the Zabrat's bramble, is a variant of the bramble plant native to specific regions of Eastern Europe. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. The leaves are typically trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the plant produces aggregate fruits composed of small, juicy drupelets. It thrives in woodland edges and disturbed soils, preferring partial shade to full sun. This plant plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for wildlife and supporting pollinators."
