It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically composed of 11 to 31 pairs of ovate to lanceolate leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in upright clusters, followed by red, fuzzy berries that are a common food source for birds. Rhus obscura thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in woodlands, thickets, and disturbed areas. Its botanical features make it an important component of native plant ecosystems."
