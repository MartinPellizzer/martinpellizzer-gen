    "intro": "Rorippa nudiuscula subsp. serrata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved watercress, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist environments such as stream banks, ditches, and wet meadows. The plant has finely divided, serrated leaves that are often submerged or floating, with small white flowers that appear in clusters. Its reproductive strategy involves wind pollination, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that release tiny seeds. This subspecies is notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-rich waters and its use in traditional herbal medicine."
