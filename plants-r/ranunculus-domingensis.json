    "intro": "Ranunculus domingensis, commonly known as the Dominican buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the Caribbean island of Hispaniola. It features striking, bright yellow flowers with deeply lobed petals that resemble those of other ranunculus species. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a hairy texture that aids in water retention. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant blooms."
