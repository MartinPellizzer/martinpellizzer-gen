    "intro": "Rubus riparium, commonly known as waterberry or river raspberry, is a perennial shrub native to the wetlands and stream banks of eastern North America. It typically grows in moist, often waterlogged soils, and is characterized by its slender, arching stems and clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers. The plant produces edible berries that are usually red or black in color, though they are often tart and less palatable than other Rubus species. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three leaflets that are oval to elliptical in shape. Rubus riparium plays an important ecological role by providing food for various wildlife species and stabilizing soil along aquatic habitats."
