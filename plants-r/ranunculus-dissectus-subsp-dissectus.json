    "intro": "Ranunculus dissectus subsp. dissectus, commonly known as the dissected buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It features delicate, showy flowers with yellow centers and white petals that are deeply lobed, giving the plant its characteristic \"dissected\" appearance. The leaves are palmately divided, often with a hairy texture, and are typically arranged in a basal rosette. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and stream banks. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its early spring blooms."
