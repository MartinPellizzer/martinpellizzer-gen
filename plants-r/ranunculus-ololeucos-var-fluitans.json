    "intro": "Ranunculus ololeucos var. fluitans, commonly known as the floating water crowfoot, is a aquatic plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves that are typically divided into three to five segments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and lakes. Its presence is often an indicator of clean, well-oxygenated water."
