It is characterized by its upright growth habit and distinctive, triangular, serrated leaves that are often reddish in color. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense, branched clusters called thyrses, which are typical of the species. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. This subspecies is notable for its medicinal uses and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes."
