    "intro": "Ribes grossularia var. glabrum, commonly known as the smooth gooseberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous stems and leaves that are typically ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits known as berries, which are usually yellow to orange in color. These berries are edible, though often tart, and are used in culinary applications. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a hardy and adaptable plant for gardens and natural habitats."
