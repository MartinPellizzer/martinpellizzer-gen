    "intro": "Rubus nitidus var. albiflorus, commonly known as the whiteflower evergreen bramble, is a variant of the evergreen bramble species native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, thorny growth habit and small, elliptical leaves with a glossy upper surface. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, hairy fruits in the fall. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
