    "intro": "Rosa lavrenkoi, commonly known as the Lavrenko rose, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white. The plant has dark green, serrated leaves and is typically found in rocky or limestone soils. It blooms in late spring to early summer, adding ornamental value to its natural habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Rosa lavrenkoi is considered a botanically significant and ecologically vulnerable species."
