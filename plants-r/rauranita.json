    "intro": "Rauranita, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent petals that appear to shimmer in the sunlight, giving it a spectral appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom only during the night, attracting specific nocturnal pollinators. Rauranita thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found growing in rocky crevices or on the edges of cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and unique adaptations, it is considered a subject of fascination for botanists and conservationists alike."
