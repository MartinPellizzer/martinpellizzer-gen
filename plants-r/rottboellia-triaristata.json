    "intro": "Rottboellia triaristata, commonly known as the three-awn grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and distinctive, slender spikelets with three awns. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a fibrous texture. Rottboellia triaristata is often used in erosion control due to its rapid growth and ability to establish dense vegetation."
