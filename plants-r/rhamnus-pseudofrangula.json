    "intro": "Rhamnus pseudofrangula, commonly known as the European buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Europe. It typically grows to a height of 2\u20136 meters and is characterized by its smooth, dark gray bark and alternate, simple, elliptic leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by dark blue, fleshy berries that are an important food source for birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges, hedgerows, and rocky areas."
