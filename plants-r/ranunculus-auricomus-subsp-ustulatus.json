    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus subsp. ustulatus, commonly known as the yellow crowfoot, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features bright yellow flowers with five to seven petals, typically arranged in a cup-like shape, and is characterized by its finely divided, trifoliate leaves. The plant thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. It is a member of the Ranunculaceae family, known for its showy flowers and often toxic compounds. The subspecies ustulatus is distinguished by its slightly different leaf morphology and habitat preferences compared to the typical form of R. auricomus."
