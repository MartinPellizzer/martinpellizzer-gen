    "intro": "Rorida brachystyla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rorid, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that are typically pale blue or purple in color. The plant has a low-growing habit with hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in coastal areas where it benefits from the moist sea breeze. Rorida brachystyla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil."
