    "intro": "Ranunculus dissidens, commonly known as the split-leaved buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the Mediterranean region. It features finely divided, fern-like leaves and produces showy yellow flowers with five petals. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Its flowers open in the morning and close by midday, a behavior known as nyctinasty. Ranunculus dissidens is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
