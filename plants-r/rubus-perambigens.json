    "intro": "Rubus perambigens, commonly known as the coastal raspberry, is a shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and produces small, red, edible berries. The plant has compound leaves with serrated edges and thorny stems that help it cling to rocky or coastal terrain. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in coastal dunes and along shorelines. Its flowers are white or pale pink, and it plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing food for wildlife."
