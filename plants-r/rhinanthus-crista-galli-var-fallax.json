    "intro": "Rhinanthus crista-galli var. fallax, commonly known as the autumn marsh gentian, is a variant of the common marsh gentian. It is a herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia, typically found in wet meadows and marshy areas. The plant produces striking blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer to autumn. It has narrow, lance-shaped leaves and a fibrous root system adapted to waterlogged soils. This variant is less common than the typical form and is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological role in wetland habitats."
