    "intro": "Rhododendron fimbriatum, commonly known as the fringe-leaved rhododendron, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern Himalayas. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, serrated leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to white, typically blooming in late spring. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and partial shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its showy blooms and distinctive foliage."
