    "intro": "Rosa canina subvar. aciphylla, commonly known as the prickly rose, is a subspecies of the dog rose native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and small, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces aggregate fruits called rose hips, which are rich in vitamin C and often used in herbal remedies. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have serrated edges, typical of many rose species. This subspecies is well adapted to a variety of soil types and can thrive in both full sun and partial shade."
