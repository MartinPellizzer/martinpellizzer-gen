    "intro": "Reissantia indica var. orientalis, commonly known as the oriental Indian reissantia, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically a deep green with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, which bloom in clusters. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable conditions."
