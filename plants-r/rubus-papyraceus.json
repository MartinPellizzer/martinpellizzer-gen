It is characterized by its thin, papery leaves that give it its common name, and its small, red, edible berries. The plant is part of the Rosaceae family, which includes many other fruit-bearing plants. It thrives in moist, wooded areas and is often found in the understory of forests. The berries are used in local cuisine and have a tart, acidic flavor."
