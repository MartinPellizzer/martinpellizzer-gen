    "intro": "Ranunculus stricticaulis, commonly known as the slenderleaf buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features delicate, palmately lobed leaves that are typically hairy and arranged in a basal rosette. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with five petals and numerous stamens, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
