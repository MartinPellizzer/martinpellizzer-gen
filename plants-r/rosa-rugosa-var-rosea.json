    "intro": "Rosa rugosa var. rosea, commonly known as the pink beach rose, is a vigorous, deciduous shrub native to coastal regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its rugged, thorny stems and clusters of fragrant, pink to reddish-pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has dark green, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white\u7ed2\u6bdb, giving it a distinctive appearance. It is highly adaptable, thriving in saline and sandy soils, making it a popular choice for coastal gardens. Its hardy nature and ability to tolerate harsh conditions make it a valuable plant for erosion control and ornamental purposes."
