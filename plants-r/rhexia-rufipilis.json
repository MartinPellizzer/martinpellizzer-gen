    "intro": "Rhexia rufipilis, commonly known as the redstem sandverbena, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist, sandy soils along stream banks and wetlands. The plant features slender, branching stems that are often reddish in color, especially when mature. Its small, clustered flowers are usually pink to red, blooming in late summer. Rhexia rufipilis is a valuable plant for wetland restoration due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for pollinators."
