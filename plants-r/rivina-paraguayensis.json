    "intro": "Rivina paraguayensis, commonly known as Paraguay riverbine, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Paraguay and Brazil. It is a shrub that typically grows in moist, tropical environments, often near rivers and in shaded forest understories. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are usually pink or red, which attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly hairy texture. The plant is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage and floral display."
