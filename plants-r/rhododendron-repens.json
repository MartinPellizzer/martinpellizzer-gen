    "intro": "Rhododendron repens, commonly known as creeping azalea, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the northern regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features dense clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and red, typically blooming in late spring. The plant has dark green, leathery leaves that are arranged in whorls around the stems. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for ground cover in woodland gardens. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a valuable addition to shaded landscapes."
