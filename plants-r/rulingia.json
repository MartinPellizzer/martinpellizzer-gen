It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and includes several species such as Rulingia microphylla. The plant is characterized by its striking, bright yellow flowers that resemble torches, which bloom in clusters during the dry season. Its leaves are typically palmate, with five to seven lobes, and the bark is often smooth and light-colored. Rulingia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique floral display."
