    "intro": "Rinorea pachycarpa, commonly known as the thick-fruited rinorea, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its showy, often pink or purple flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with thick, fleshy fruits that are an important food source for local wildlife. Its leaves are usually ovate or elliptical, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and it prefers well-drained soils in humid environments. Rinorea pachycarpa is valued both for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in its native habitats."
