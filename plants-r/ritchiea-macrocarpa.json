    "intro": "Ritchiea macrocarpa, commonly known as the giant cycad, is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is native to the tropical rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its massive, trunk-like stem and large, feathery leaves that can grow up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces large, cone-like structures, with male and female cones on separate plants, typical of cycads. Ritchiea macrocarpa is a slow-growing plant that can live for centuries, making it a long-lived component of its ecosystem. Due to its rarity and ecological significance, it is protected in its natural habitat."
