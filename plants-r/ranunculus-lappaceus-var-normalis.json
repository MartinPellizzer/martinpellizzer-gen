    "intro": "Ranunculus lappaceus var. normalis, commonly known as the common water buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist or wet habitats such as marshes, streambanks, and damp woodlands. The plant features a basal rosette of dark green, glossy leaves that are palmately lobed and often covered in a waxy coating. Its flowers are bright yellow with 5 to 15 sepals, and it produces small, hairy fruits that disperse seeds by wind. This species is often found in nutrient-rich soils and is a characteristic component of wetland flora."
