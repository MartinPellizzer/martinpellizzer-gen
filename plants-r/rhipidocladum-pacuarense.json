    "intro": "Rhipidocladum pacuarense, commonly known as the Pacuare cliff fern, is a rare and endemic species found in the mountainous regions of Costa Rica. It belongs to the Polypodiaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that form dense, low-growing mats. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically on rocky outcrops or in forest understories. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of its leaves. Due to its restricted habitat and vulnerability to environmental changes, Rhipidocladum pacuarense is considered a conservation concern."
