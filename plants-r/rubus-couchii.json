    "intro": "Rubus couchii, commonly known as the creeping blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the western United States. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and the production of edible, though tart, blackberries. The plant features trifoliate leaves and produces small, white to pinkish flowers in the spring. Its berries are typically harvested in the fall and are used in local cuisines. Rubus couchii plays an important ecological role by providing food for wildlife and stabilizing soil in its native habitats."
