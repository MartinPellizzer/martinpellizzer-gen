    "intro": "Rumex hippolapathum var. domesticus, commonly known as the domestic sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive reddish coloration, often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on slender, upright stalks. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a persistent weed in cultivated areas. The leaves are edible, though they contain oxalic acid and should be consumed in moderation."
