    "intro": "Ranunculus aleae, commonly known as the alpine buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange and red. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil. Its leaves are palmately divided, and the plant produces a basal rosette of foliage. Ranunculus aleae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural alpine setting."
