    "intro": "Ranunculus flammuloides, commonly known as the flameless buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It features delicate, yellow flowers with a distinctive red or orange center, often surrounded by 5 to 15 narrow, petal-like sepals. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss. Ranunculus flammuloides is known for its early spring blooming and is often found in association with other woodland flora."
