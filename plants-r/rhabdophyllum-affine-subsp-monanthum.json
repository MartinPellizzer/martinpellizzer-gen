    "intro": "Rhabdophyllum affine subsp. monanthum, commonly known as the single-flowered rhabdophyllum, is a rare and specialized member of the Ericaceae family. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen shrub form and produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white in color. The plant thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories. Its floral structure is adapted for pollination by specific insect species, and it exhibits unique morphological features that distinguish it from other subspecies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
