    "intro": "Rafflesia tiomanensis, commonly known as the Taman Negara rafflesia, is a rare and striking parasitic plant found in the rainforests of Malaysia. It is notable for producing the world's largest individual flower, which can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The plant lacks leaves, stems, and roots, relying entirely on its host, the Tetrastigma vine, for nutrients. Its flowers emit a strong, unpleasant odor resembling decaying flesh, which attracts pollinators like flies and beetles. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Rafflesia tiomanensis is considered critically endangered."
