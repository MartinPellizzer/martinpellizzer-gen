    "intro": "Ranunculus hyperboreus subsp. tricrenatus, commonly known as the Arctic buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It features basal leaves that are palmately lobed and covered in fine hairs, and its flowers are typically yellow with five petal-like sepals. The plant thrives in moist, rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold climates. It is often found in tundra and alpine environments, where it blooms in late spring to early summer. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
