    "intro": "Rosa tomentosa var. subvillosa, commonly known as the woolly rose or the soft-haired rose, is a shrub-like species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, white to grayish pubescence covering the stems, leaves, and flowers, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The leaves are typically pinnately compound, with ovate to lanceolate leaflets that are also covered in fine hairs. The flowers are usually pink to pale red, with five petals and numerous stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to dry, well-drained soils."
