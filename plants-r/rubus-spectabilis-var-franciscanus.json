    "intro": "Rubus spectabilis var. franciscanus, commonly known as the San Francisco raspberry, is a variant of the salmonberry plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically bright orange to red in color. The plant has trifoliate leaves with serrated edges and thorny stems, typical of the Rubus genus. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and edible fruits, though it is less commonly cultivated than other Rubus species."
