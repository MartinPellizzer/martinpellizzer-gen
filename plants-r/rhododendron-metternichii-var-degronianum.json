    "intro": "Rhododendron metternichii var. degronianum, commonly known as the De Grongian rhododendron, is a rare and ornamental shrub native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant prefers acidic, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its flowers range in color from pale pink to deep crimson, adding vibrant visual interest to the landscape. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable species for botanical study and conservation efforts."
