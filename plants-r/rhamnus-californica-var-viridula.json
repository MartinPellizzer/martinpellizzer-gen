    "intro": "Rhamnus californica var. viridula, commonly known as the greenleaf buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to the coastal regions of California. It features lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are often slightly hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by black, berry-like fruits in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in chaparral and coastal scrub habitats. This variety is distinguished by its more elongated, darker foliage compared to other varieties of Rhamnus californica."
