It is characterized by its rapid growth and distinctive, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by bright red berries that attract birds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and ease of cultivation, it is sometimes grown in gardens and greenhouses."
