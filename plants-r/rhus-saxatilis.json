    "intro": "Rhus saxatilis, commonly known as the smooth sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and turn vibrant red in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in upright clusters, followed by red, fuzzy fruits that contain seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or open habitats. Rhus saxatilis is also notable for its ability to tolerate drought and poor soil conditions."
