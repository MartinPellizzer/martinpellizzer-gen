    "intro": "Rudgea racemosa, commonly known as the clustered rudgea, is a flowering plant belonging to the Rubiaceae family. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its woody stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the spring. Rudgea racemosa is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study."
