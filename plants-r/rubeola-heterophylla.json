    "intro": "Rubeola heterophylla, commonly known as the variable leaf measles plant, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its variable leaf morphology, which can range from simple to lobed or even compound. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, and it is often found in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are typically hairy and have a distinct scent when crushed. Rubeola heterophylla is valued in traditional medicine for its purported medicinal properties."
