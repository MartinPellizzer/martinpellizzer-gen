    "intro": "Rosa gentilis var. portenschlagii, commonly known as the Portenschlagii rose, is a rare and ornamental species native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit, with thorned stems and clusters of fragrant, pink to white flowers. The plant produces small, oval-shaped leaves with serrated edges, typical of many rose species. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, requiring moderate watering and regular pruning to maintain its shape. Due to its rarity and aesthetic appeal, it is often cultivated in specialized gardens and botanic collections."
