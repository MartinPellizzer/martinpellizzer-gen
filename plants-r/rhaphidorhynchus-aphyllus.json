It is characterized by its lack of a visible shell and its soft, gelatinous body. This species is typically found in marine environments, particularly in shallow coastal waters. Its body is often adorned with various colored patterns, which may serve as camouflage or for species recognition. Rhaphidorhynchus aphyllus primarily feeds on algae and other plant matter, playing a role in marine ecosystem dynamics."
