    "intro": "Rubus corylifolius var. litoralis, commonly known as the coastal blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant adapted to coastal environments. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces dark purple to black berries that are typically smaller than those of the standard Rubus corylifolius. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune ecosystems. This variety is valued for its hardiness and ability to stabilize coastal dunes."
