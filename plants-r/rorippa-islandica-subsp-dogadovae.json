    "intro": "Rorippa islandica subsp. dogadovae, commonly known as the island cress, is a small annual herbaceous plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It typically grows in moist, rocky or sandy soils, often in alpine or tundra environments. The plant features simple, alternate leaves that are usually covered in a fine layer of white wax, aiding in water retention. Its small, yellow flowers are arranged in clusters and bloom during the short growing season. This subspecies is adapted to extreme cold and has a short life cycle to complete its growth and reproduction before winter."
