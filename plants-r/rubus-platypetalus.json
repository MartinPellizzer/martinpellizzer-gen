    "intro": "Rubus platypetalus, commonly known as the flat-petaled blackberry, is a species of bramble native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The flowers are typically white or pale pink, with five petals that are broader than they are long. The fruit, a small blackberry-like berry, is edible and often used in jams and desserts. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is an important part of the understory vegetation in forest ecosystems."
