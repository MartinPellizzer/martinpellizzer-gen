It is characterized by its arching stems and clusters of small, white to pink flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces edible, red, raspberry-like fruits that are typically harvested in late summer. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the plant is often cultivated for both its ornamental value and its fruit. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight."
