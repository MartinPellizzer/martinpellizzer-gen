    "intro": "Rubus schleicheri var. chloroxylon, commonly known as the green-stem blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to parts of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive greenish stems and leaves, which set it apart from other Rubus species. The plant produces small, dark berries that are typically harvested in late summer. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists."
