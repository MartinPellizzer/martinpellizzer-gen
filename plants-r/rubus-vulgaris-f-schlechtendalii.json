    "intro": "Rubus vulgaris f. schlechtendalii, commonly known as the Schlechtendalii form of common bramble, is a botanical variant of the widespread Rubus vulgaris species. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense, thorny stems, which are typical of the Rubus genus. The leaves are usually trifoliate, with serrated margins, and the plant produces small, aggregate fruits known as raspberries. This form is often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a genetic resource for breeding programs aimed at improving raspberry cultivars."
