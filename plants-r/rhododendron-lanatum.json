    "intro": "Rhododendron lanatum, commonly known as the downy rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive, soft appearance. The plant typically grows as an evergreen shrub, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its flowers are usually pink to purple, appearing in clusters and blooming in early spring. Rhododendron lanatum prefers acidic, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens."
