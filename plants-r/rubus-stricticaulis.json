    "intro": "Rubus stricticaulis, commonly known as the upright blackberry shrub, is a species of bramble native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its erect growth habit and thorny stems, which distinguish it from other Rubus species. The plant produces aggregate fruits, typically dark purple to black in color, which are edible and used in culinary applications. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it thrives in woodland and disturbed soils. Rubus stricticaulis plays an important role in supporting local wildlife, providing food and habitat for various insects and birds."
