    "intro": "Rubus lejeunei var. lasiocaulon, commonly known as the woolly blackberry, is a variant of the Rubus genus characterized by its dense, white-tomentose (hairy) covering on its stems and leaves. It is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of South America, particularly in Chile and Argentina. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black in color when mature. Its foliage is usually alternate and has serrated margins, with leaves that are broadly ovate to elliptic in shape. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
