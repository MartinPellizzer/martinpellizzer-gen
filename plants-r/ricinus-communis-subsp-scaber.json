    "intro": "Ricinus communis subsp. scaber, commonly known as the rough castor plant, is a species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves that are covered in stiff, bristly hairs, giving it a rough texture. The plant produces distinctive spiny capsules that contain toxic, oily seeds. It thrives in warm climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. However, due to the toxicity of its seeds, it requires careful handling and is not recommended for indoor cultivation."
