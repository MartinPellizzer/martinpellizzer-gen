    "intro": "Ruellia nemorum, commonly known as the woodland ruellia, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy and have a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Ruellia nemorum thrives in partial to full shade and moist, well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
