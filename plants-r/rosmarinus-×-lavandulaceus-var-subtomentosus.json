    "intro": "Rosmarinus \u00d7 lavandulaceus var. subtomentosus, commonly known as the woolly rosemary-lavender hybrid, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Rosmarinus officinalis and Lavandula angustifolia. It exhibits a unique combination of characteristics from both parent species, featuring dense, woolly foliage and aromatic, lavender-colored flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub with compact, upright growth habit, often reaching heights of up to 60 cm. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and covered in fine, white to grayish hairs, giving it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
