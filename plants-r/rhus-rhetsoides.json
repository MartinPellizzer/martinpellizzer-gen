    "intro": "Rhus rhetsoides, commonly known as smooth sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and turn vibrant red in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in upright clusters, followed by red, fuzzy berries that are a food source for birds. Smooth sumac thrives in full sun to partial shade and is adaptable to various soil types. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
