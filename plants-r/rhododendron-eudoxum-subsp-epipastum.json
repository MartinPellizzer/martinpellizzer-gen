    "intro": "Rhododendron eudoxum subsp. epipastum, commonly known as the Himalayan rhododendron, is a species native to the eastern Himalayas. It is a shrub that typically grows at high altitudes, often in moist, shaded environments. The plant features broad, leathery leaves and produces clusters of showy, pink to red flowers in the spring. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens in temperate regions. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly smaller flowers and more compact growth habit compared to the typical form of R. eudoxum."
