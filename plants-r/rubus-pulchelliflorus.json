    "intro": "Rubus pulchelliflorus, commonly known as the showy bramble, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible but often described as tart. Native to parts of eastern North America, it thrives in woodland and open areas with well-drained soil. Its ornamental value has made it a subject of interest in horticulture and botanical studies."
