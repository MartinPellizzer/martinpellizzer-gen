    "intro": "Rumex stenophyllus var. frutescens, commonly known as red sorrel, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It features heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly rough texture. The plant produces clusters of small, reddish-pink flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its leaves are edible, though they have a tart, tangy flavor due to the presence of oxalic acid."
