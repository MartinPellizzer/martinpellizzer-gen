    "intro": "Rosa glauca f. fornensis, commonly known as the Fornense bluebush rose, is a rare and ornamental cultivar of the Rosa glauca species. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and profuse display of semi-double, pale blue to lavender-pink flowers. The plant typically features thorny stems and dark green, leathery foliage that provides a striking contrast to its floral display. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Due to its limited distribution and specific horticultural requirements, it is considered a valuable addition to botanical collections."
