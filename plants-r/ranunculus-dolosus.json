It features showy, yellow flowers with a distinctive black center, which can be misleading to herbivores. The plant has palmate leaves that are deeply lobed, and it typically grows in rocky or disturbed soils. It is part of the Ranunculaceae family, known for its often toxic compounds. Ranunculus dolosus is adapted to dry environments and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands."
