    "intro": "Rubus parviflorus var. bifarius, commonly known as the small-flowered blackberry shrub, is a species native to North America. It is characterized by its thorny stems and trifoliate leaves, which are typically serrated along the edges. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible blackberries in the summer. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, loamy soils. This shrub is often found in woodland edges, thickets, and disturbed areas, contributing to local biodiversity."
