It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are heart-shaped and often have a velvety texture. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or yellow when ripe. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
