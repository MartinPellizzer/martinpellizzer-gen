    "intro": "Rosa montana var. pliniana, commonly known as the Plinian rose, is a hybrid rose species originating from the cross between Rosa montana and Rosa pliniana. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of fragrant, semi-double pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically reaches a height of 1 to 2 meters and has dark green, glossy foliage. It is a hardy shrub that thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for garden borders and hedges. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its pleasant scent and ability to attract pollinators."
