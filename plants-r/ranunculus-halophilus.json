    "intro": "Ranunculus halophilus, commonly known as the salt marsh buttercup, is a flowering plant adapted to saline environments. It is native to coastal areas and salt marshes in Europe and Asia. The plant produces bright yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in early spring. Its leaves are palmately divided and often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Ranunculus halophilus thrives in brackish or saline soils and plays a role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems."
