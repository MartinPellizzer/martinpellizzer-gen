    "intro": "Reynoldsia sandwicensis, commonly known as the Hawaiian sandalwood, is a rare and endangered tree native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a member of the Rutaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic wood and small, white flowers. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in coastal forests and mesic habitats. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and have a distinctive aromatic scent. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
