    "intro": "Rumex acetosella subsp. angiocarpus, commonly known as narrowleaf sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wet meadows. The plant has alternate, ovate leaves with a distinctive reddish coloration on the underside, and it produces small, greenish flowers in clusters. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats. The species is characterized by its unique fruit structure, which is a three-lobed, winged capsule that aids in seed dispersal."
