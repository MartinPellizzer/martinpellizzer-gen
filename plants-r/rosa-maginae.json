    "intro": "Rosa maginae, commonly known as the silverleaf rose, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its silvery-white undersides on its leaves, which give it its distinctive appearance. The plant produces fragrant pink to red flowers in late spring to early summer. Its foliage is evergreen, providing ornamental value throughout the year. Rosa maginae is valued in horticulture for its aesthetic appeal and hardiness in colder climates."
