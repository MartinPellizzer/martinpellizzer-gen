    "intro": "Rhachidosorus truncatus, commonly known as the broad-leafed clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its creeping, rhizomatous growth habit and produces erect, cone-like strobila that bear sporophytes. The plant has scale-like leaves that are arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. It is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Rhachidosorus truncatus plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates."
