    "intro": "Rosa pimpinellifolia var. vulgaris, commonly known as the rock rose, is a species of flowering plant in the rose family. It is native to southern Europe and western Asia, often found growing in rocky or coastal areas. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in spring. Its leaves are pinnately divided, with a silvery underside, and the stems are covered in fine, soft hairs. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticulture for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
