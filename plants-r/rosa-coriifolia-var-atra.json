    "intro": "Rosa coriifolia var. atra, commonly known as the black rose, is a variant of the shrub rose characterized by its dark, almost black, petals. It is native to eastern Asia, particularly China, and thrives in temperate climates. The plant features thorny stems and small, lobed leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white down. Its flowers, which bloom in early spring, are usually pink to red in color, though the variety's name suggests a darker hue in some cases. This ornamental plant is valued for its unique appearance and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
