    "intro": "Rumex flexuosus, commonly known as flexible sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features basal leaves that are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, with a distinctive sour taste due to its high oxalic acid content. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats."
