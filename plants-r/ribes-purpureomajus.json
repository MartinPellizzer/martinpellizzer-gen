    "intro": "Ribes purpureomajus, commonly known as the purple-leaf currant, is a deciduous shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its vibrant purple foliage, which becomes more intense in the fall, and its clusters of small, edible berries that ripen in late summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 feet and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are broadly ovate with serrated edges, and it produces fragrant, yellowish-green flowers in the spring. Ribes purpureomajus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic and culinary uses."
