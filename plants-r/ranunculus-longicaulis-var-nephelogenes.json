    "intro": "Ranunculus longicaulis var. nephelogenes, commonly known as the cloud-dwelling buttercup, is a rare and striking member of the Ranunculaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, palmately divided leaves and showy, yellowish-white flowers with numerous stamens. Native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas, this variant thrives in cool, moist environments. Its unique morphology and habitat make it a subject of interest in botanical studies. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species."
