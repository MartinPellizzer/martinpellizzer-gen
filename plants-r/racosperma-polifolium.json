    "intro": "Racosperma polifolium, commonly known as the broad-leaved acacia, is a shrub native to Australia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically trifoliate or pinnate, and its yellow flowers that appear in globular clusters. The plant belongs to the Fabaceae family, also known as the legume or pea family, and is known for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as woodlands and grasslands. Racosperma polifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine by Indigenous Australian communities."
