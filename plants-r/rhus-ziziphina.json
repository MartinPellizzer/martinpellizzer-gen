    "intro": "Rhus ziziphina, commonly known as smooth sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically pinnately arranged with 11 to 31 leaflets. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, fuzzy berries in the fall. Smooth sumac thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in disturbed areas, along roadsides, and in open woodlands. It has a long history of use by Indigenous peoples for medicinal and practical purposes."
