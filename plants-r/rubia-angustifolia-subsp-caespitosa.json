It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant features slender, upright stems with opposite, lanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, clustered flowers are usually pink or reddish, blooming in early summer. The roots contain a red dye, historically used in textile production, and the plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal."
