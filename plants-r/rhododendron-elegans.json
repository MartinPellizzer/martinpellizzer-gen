    "intro": "Rhododendron elegans, commonly known as the elegant rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of East Asia, particularly China. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 10 meters. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, providing a striking contrast to the vibrant pink or red flowers. Rhododendron elegans prefers acidic, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens."
