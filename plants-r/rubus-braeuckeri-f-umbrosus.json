    "intro": "Rubus braeuckeri f. umbrosus, commonly known as the shaded raspberry, is a rare and unique variant of the Rubus genus. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves and small, clustered white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands or forest understories. Its fruit, similar to other raspberries, is small and edible, though less commonly cultivated. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a botanical curiosity and of interest to plant enthusiasts and researchers."
