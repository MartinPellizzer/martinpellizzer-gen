    "intro": "Racosperma hystrix subsp. continuum, commonly known as the silky acacia, is a shrub native to northern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and compound leaves with small, lance-shaped leaflets. The plant produces yellow flowers in dense, cylindrical spikes, which are typical of the Acacia genus. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. The subspecies is distinguished by its more elongated and less rigid growth habit compared to other racosperma species."
