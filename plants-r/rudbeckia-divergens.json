It features large, showy yellow-orange flower heads with dark centers, typically growing on tall, branched stems. The plant has heart-shaped, palmately lobed leaves that are often hairy and arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in wet or moist soils, often found in swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. Rudbeckia divergens is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
