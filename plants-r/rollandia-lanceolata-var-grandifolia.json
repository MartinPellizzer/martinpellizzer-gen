    "intro": "Rollandia lanceolata var. grandifolia, commonly known as the giant lanceleaf hibiscus, is a striking tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, lance-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 cm in length. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of red, yellow, and orange, often with a prominent central throat. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. This variant is prized for its ornamental value in gardens and as a specimen plant due to its dramatic foliage and vibrant blooms."
