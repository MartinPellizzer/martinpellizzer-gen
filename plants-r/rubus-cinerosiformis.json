    "intro": "Rubus cinerosiformis, commonly known as the blackberry lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its dark, sooty appearance, which gives it its scientific name, with \"cinerosiformis\" referring to its smoky or soot-like coloration. This lichen typically grows on bark, stone, or wood in moist, shaded environments. It is found in temperate regions across the Northern Hemisphere, including parts of North America, Europe, and Asia. Rubus cinerosiformis is a non-parasitic, symbiotic organism composed of a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium."
