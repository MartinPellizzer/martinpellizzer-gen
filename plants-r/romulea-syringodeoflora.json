    "intro": "Romulea syringodeoflora, commonly known as the golden bulb orchid, is a member of the Iridaceae family and is native to South Africa. It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers that resemble those of the orchid genus, though it is not a true orchid. The plant produces a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and has a short, stout stem that bears the flower spike. Its flowering period typically occurs in spring, and it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. Romulea syringodeoflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant blooms."
