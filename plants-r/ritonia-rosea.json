    "intro": "Ritonia rosea, commonly known as the pink moonflower, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, showy, pinkish-white blooms that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant has a woody stem with rough, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its flowers emit a sweet fragrance that becomes more noticeable in the evening. Ritonia rosea is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique nocturnal blooming habit."
