    "intro": "Rubus argenteus var. stereacanthoides, commonly known as the silverleaf bramble, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its silvery-white undersides on its leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, red berries that are typically edible but often have a tart flavor. Its stems are covered in stiff, curved prickles, which are a distinctive feature of the species. This variety is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, thriving in cooler, higher elevation environments."
