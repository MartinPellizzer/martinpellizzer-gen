    "intro": "Rhododendron oxyphyllum, commonly known as the alpine rhododendron, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and showy, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in acidic, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, humid climates. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Rhododendron oxyphyllum is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens and alpine settings."
