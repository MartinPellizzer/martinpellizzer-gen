    "intro": "Rosa canina subvar. ramosissima, commonly known as the brambles rose, is a variant of the dog rose that is characterized by its dense, thorny growth habit. It produces small, pink to red flowers that bloom in spring, followed by orange-red hips, which are rich in vitamin C. The plant is native to Europe and western Asia and thrives in well-drained soils. It is often found in hedgerows, woodland edges, and disturbed areas. Its robust growth and adaptability make it a common wild plant in temperate regions."
