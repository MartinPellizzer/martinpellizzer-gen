    "intro": "Racosperma williamsianum, commonly known as the Williams' acacia, is a small to medium-sized shrub native to Western Australia. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its pod-bearing fruits and nitrogen-fixing capabilities. The plant features compound leaves with phyllodes, which are flattened, leaf-like stems that perform photosynthesis. It produces yellow flowers in clusters, typically during the warmer months, and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Racosperma williamsianum is often found in sandy soils and is used in revegetation projects due to its resilience and ecological value."
