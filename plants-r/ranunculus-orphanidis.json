    "intro": "Ranunculus orphanidis, commonly known as the orphan's buttercup, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family, characterized by its showy, often colorful flowers and basal leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its flowers are usually pale yellow with a distinctive central blotch, and it produces small, hairy fruits that disperse its seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ranunculus orphanidis is considered a species of conservation concern."
