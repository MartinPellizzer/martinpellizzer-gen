    "intro": "Restio punctulatus, commonly known as the punctuated restio, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Restionaceae family, which is characteristic of the fynbos biome. The plant features slender, grass-like stems with narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. Its flowering stems produce clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers, which are typically arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences. Restio punctulatus is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions."
