    "intro": "Ranunculus ficaria var. aurantiacus, commonly known as the golden buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features delicate, bright yellow flowers with five petals and a hairy center, blooming in early spring. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are typically hairy and emit a mild, sometimes unpleasant odor. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its botanical name reflects its classification within the Ranunculaceae family, known for its showy flowers and often toxic compounds."
