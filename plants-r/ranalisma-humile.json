    "intro": "Ranalisma humile, commonly known as the dwarf ranalisma, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth or along stream banks. The plant features delicate, grass-like leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or white in color. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Ranalisma humile is considered a rare and endangered species."
