    "intro": "Rubus drejeriformis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf blackberry, is a species of brambles native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, thorny stems and small, dark green leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces aggregate fruits composed of small, dark red to black drupes that are typically consumed by birds and other animals. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including grasslands and rocky outcrops, and is often found in coastal areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
