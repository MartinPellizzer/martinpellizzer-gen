    "intro": "Rhamnus alpina f. minutifolia, commonly known as the alpine buckthorn, is a compact shrub native to alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white to grayish pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by dark blue berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Its horticultural value lies in its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in harsh conditions."
