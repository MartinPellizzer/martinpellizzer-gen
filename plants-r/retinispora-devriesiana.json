It belongs to the family Myristicaceae, which includes nutmeg and other aromatic evergreen trees. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered white flowers and leathery, elliptical leaves. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific soil conditions to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
