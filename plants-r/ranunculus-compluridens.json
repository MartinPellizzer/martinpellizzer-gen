    "intro": "Ranunculus compluridens, commonly known as the many-seedling buttercup, is a member of the Ranunculaceae family. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features showy, cup-shaped flowers with 5 to 15 sepals that are often brightly colored, ranging from yellow to red. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces numerous small seeds in a fluffy, feathery cluster, aiding in wind dispersal."
