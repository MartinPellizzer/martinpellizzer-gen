    "intro": "Rubus serpens subsp. diffusus, commonly known as the creeping blackberry, is a perennial shrub native to temperate regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and thorny stems, which help it spread across the ground. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black in color. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. This subspecies is often found in woodland edges and disturbed areas, where it plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various wildlife species."
