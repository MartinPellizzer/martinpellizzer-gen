    "intro": "Rhipsalis parasitica subsp. horrida, commonly known as the spiny mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the stems of its host plants, primarily in the genus *Bromeliaceae*. It lacks true leaves and roots, relying on its host for water and nutrients while performing photosynthesis with its modified stems. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale green, followed by small, berry-like fruits. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is often found in humid, shaded environments. Due to its parasitic nature and unique morphology, it plays a specific role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat."
