    "intro": "Rhus lucida var. elliptica, commonly known as the elliptical staghorn sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically elliptical in shape and have a smooth, glossy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, fuzzy fruits that persist into the winter. Its bark is rough and fissured, often exuding a sticky resin when damaged. This species is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed areas."
