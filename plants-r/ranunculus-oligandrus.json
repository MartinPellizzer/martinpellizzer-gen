    "intro": "Ranunculus oligandrus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family, characterized by its showy, often yellow or white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky or alpine habitats, preferring cool and temperate climates. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a distinctive leaflet arrangement, and its flowers have fewer sepals than typical buttercups. Ranunculus oligandrus is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
