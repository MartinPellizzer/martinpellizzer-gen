    "intro": "Roldana manantlanensis, commonly known as the Manantlan roldana, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its showy, daisy-like flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation areas. Its botanical significance lies in its unique adaptations to high-altitude environments and its role in local ecosystems."
