It is a shrub that typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, red, edible fruits that ripen in the fall. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the flowers are white with five petals. The plant is sometimes cultivated for its berries, although it can be invasive in certain regions."
