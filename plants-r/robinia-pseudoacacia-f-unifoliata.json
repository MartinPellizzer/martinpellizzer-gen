    "intro": "Robinia pseudoacacia f. unifoliata, commonly known as the single-leaf false acacia, is a variant of the honey locust tree characterized by its reduced foliage. This form exhibits a unique leaf structure, with each leaf reduced to a single, elongated leaflet instead of the typical compound leaves. It retains the robust, thorny appearance of the parent species, with bipinnate branches and yellow pea-like flowers. The plant is adapted to temperate climates and thrives in well-drained soils. Its botanical significance lies in its morphological variation, offering insights into genetic diversity within the Robinia genus."
