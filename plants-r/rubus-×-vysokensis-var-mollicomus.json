    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 vysokensis var. mollicomus, commonly known as the velvet raspberry, is a hybrid species within the Rubus genus, characterized by its soft, velvety foliage and fruit. It is native to parts of Eastern Europe and Asia, where it thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or black in color, with a sweet-tart flavor. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it has thorny stems typical of many Rubus species. This variety is often cultivated for both ornamental purposes and its edible fruits."
