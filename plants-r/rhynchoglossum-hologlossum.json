    "intro": "Rhynchoglossum hologlossum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the wetlands of Florida and Cuba. It is characterized by its lack of leaves and its striking, white, ghost-like flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, as it lacks the ability to photosynthesize due to its absence of chlorophyll. Its delicate structure and habitat-specific requirements make it highly sensitive to environmental changes. Conservation efforts are crucial to protect this endangered species from habitat loss and climate change."
