It features upright, thornless stems and produces fragrant, semi-double pink flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant has glossy, dark green foliage that provides a lush backdrop for its blooms. It is well-suited for rock gardens or as a container plant due to its small size and ornamental value. The variety is noted for its hardiness and ability to thrive in a range of soil conditions."
