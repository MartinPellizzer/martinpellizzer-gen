    "intro": "Rhus longipes var. grandifolia, commonly known as the bigleaf sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and often have serrated margins. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in panicles, followed by red, fuzzy fruits that are a common food source for birds. Its bark is smooth and grayish, becoming fissured with age, and it thrives in full sun to partial shade. The species is notable for its ornamental value and adaptability to various soil types."
