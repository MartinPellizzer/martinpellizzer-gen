    "intro": "Rhus sumac, commonly known as staghorn sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are bright green in summer and turn vibrant red in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which develop into red, fuzzy berries that are a food source for birds and mammals. Rhus sumac thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in open woodlands, thickets, and along roadsides. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and ecologically important plant in its native habitat."
