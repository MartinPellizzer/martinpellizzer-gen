    "intro": "Rosa rigidula, commonly known as the rigid rose or desert rose, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its woody stems, which are often covered in stiff, bristly hairs, and its small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces small, oval-shaped fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Rosa rigidula is adapted to survive in harsh environments, with deep roots that help it access water from underground sources. It is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of edible flowers and leaves."
