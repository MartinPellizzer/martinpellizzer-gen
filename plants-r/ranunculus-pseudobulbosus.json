    "intro": "Ranunculus pseudobulbosus, commonly known as the false bulbous buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features a distinctive underground rhizome that allows it to store nutrients and survive harsh conditions. The plant produces showy, yellow or orange flowers with five to eight petals, often surrounded by sepals that resemble leaves. Its leaves are typically trifoliate, with three leaflets that are deeply lobed. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats."
