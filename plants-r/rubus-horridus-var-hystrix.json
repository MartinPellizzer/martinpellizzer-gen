    "intro": "Rubus horridus var. hystrix, commonly known as the bristly blackberry, is a thorny shrub native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, prickly stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black in color. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges or disturbed soils. Due to its thorny nature, it can be challenging to handle without protective gear."
