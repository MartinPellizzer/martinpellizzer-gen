    "intro": "Rumex subvirescens, commonly known as yellow sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has alternate, heart-shaped leaves that are often reddish at the base and yellowish at the tips. Its flowers are small and borne in clusters, with separate male and female flowers on the same inflorescence. The plant is characterized by its succulent, somewhat fleshy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in its preferred habitat."
