It features delicate, palmately divided leaves and showy, yellow flowers with five petals. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and along stream banks. Its flowers bloom in early spring, often before the canopy of trees fully develops. The subspecies is characterized by its more yellowish flowers compared to the typical white or pale yellow of the main species."
