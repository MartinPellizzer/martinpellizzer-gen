    "intro": "Rubus neovestitus, commonly known as the woolly blackberry, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rosaceae. It is native to the western United States, particularly California and Oregon, where it grows in moist, shaded areas. The plant is characterized by its dense, woolly white or gray pubescence covering its stems and leaves. Its flowers are typically pink to white, and it produces edible berries that are similar in appearance to other blackberries. The plant is often found in chaparral and coastal scrub habitats, contributing to local biodiversity."
