    "intro": "Racinaea strobeliorum, commonly known as the Strobel's ghost fern, is a rare and enigmatic fern species native to the tropical rainforests of Central America. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent fronds that resemble ghostly apparitions against the forest floor. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments with rich, well-draining soil. Its unique morphology includes intricate, lace-like veins that contribute to its ethereal appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
