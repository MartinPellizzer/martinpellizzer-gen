    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 divergens f. supertomentosus, commonly known as the woolly blackberry, is a botanical variant of the blackberry plant characterized by its dense, white to grayish woolly covering on its stems and leaves. It is a hybrid species within the Rubus genus, known for its thorny stems and compound leaves with three to five leaflets. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black when mature. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils. Its hairy texture provides a distinctive appearance and may offer some protection against herbivores."
