    "intro": "Ratonia lachnocarpa, commonly known as the sticky bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its unique bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, aiding in its nutrient acquisition. The plant typically grows in shallow, still waters such as ponds and ditches, where it can anchor itself to substrates. Its leaves are often submerged, while its flowering stems rise to the surface to produce small, inconspicuous flowers. Ratonia lachnocarpa is a carnivorous plant, adapting to nutrient-poor environments by supplementing its diet with captured prey."
