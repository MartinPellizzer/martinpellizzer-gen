    "intro": "Rosa glauciskagerakensis, commonly known as the Kagera rose, is a rare and endemic species native to the Kagera River basin in East Africa. It is characterized by its pale blue to white flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a shrub-like growth habit with thorny stems and dark green, serrated leaves. Its botanical features include glandular hairs on the foliage and a strong, aromatic scent. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native region."
