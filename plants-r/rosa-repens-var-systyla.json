    "intro": "Rosa repens var. systyla, commonly known as the creeping rose or climbing rose, is a shrub-like perennial plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its trailing stems that can root at the nodes, allowing it to spread horizontally along the ground or climb supports. The plant produces fragrant, pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are compound, consisting of five to seven oval-shaped leaflets, and the plant is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value. Rosa repens var. systyla is relatively hardy and adaptable, thriving in a variety of soil types and light conditions."
