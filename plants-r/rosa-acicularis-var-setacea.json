    "intro": "Rosa acicularis var. setacea, commonly known as the prickly rose, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its thorny stems and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of pink to white. The plant produces rose hips, which are the fruit containing the seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its winter interest, as the stems remain visible after leaf drop."
