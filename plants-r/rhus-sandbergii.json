    "intro": "Rhus sandbergii, commonly known as sandberg's sumac, is a deciduous shrub native to the central and eastern United States. It typically grows in open woodlands, prairies, and along stream banks, preferring well-drained soils. The plant features compound leaves with 15 to 31 leaflets, which are serrated and turn red in the fall. Its small, yellowish-green flowers appear in clusters and are followed by red, fuzzy fruits that disperse seeds by wind. Rhus sandbergii is valued for its ornamental qualities and its role in supporting local wildlife."
