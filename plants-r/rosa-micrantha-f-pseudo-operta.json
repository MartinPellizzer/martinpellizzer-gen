    "intro": "Rosa micrantha f. pseudo-operta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rose, is a flowering plant species native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or white. The leaves are narrow and serrated, with a slightly hairy surface, and the stems are often covered in fine, pale-colored prickles. This variety is prized for its ornamental value in gardens and for its ability to thrive in cooler, moist climates. It is also notable for its role in traditional herbal medicine in some Asian cultures."
