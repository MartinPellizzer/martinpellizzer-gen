    "intro": "Rumex acetosella var. macrophyllus, commonly known as sheep's sorrel, is a variant of the common sorrel plant. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its heart-shaped, reddish-veined leaves. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on slender stalks. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its foliage is edible but contains oxalic acid, which can be toxic in large quantities."
