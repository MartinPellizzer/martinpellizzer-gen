It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that mature to a deep red color. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland areas or along the edges of forests. Its berries are edible, though they are typically smaller and less sweet compared to other blackberry varieties."
