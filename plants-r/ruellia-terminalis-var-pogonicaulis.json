    "intro": "Ruellia terminalis var. pogonicaulis, commonly known as the Florida rain lily, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing nectar that attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged oppositely along the stem, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. This variety is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local ecosystems."
