    "intro": "Rosa \u00d7 brachypoda f. vulturina, commonly known as the \"vulture rose,\" is a compact, thorny shrub native to the western United States. It features small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by red or orange hips. The plant has dark green, oval-shaped leaves with serrated edges and produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters. It is well adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and mountainous regions. Its botanical name reflects its hybrid origin and its distinctive, almost predatory appearance."
