    "intro": "Rhizophora candel, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a tropical tree native to coastal regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its distinctive aerial roots, which help anchor the plant in soft, waterlogged soils. The tree produces small, pinkish flowers that are pollinated by insects and birds. Its seeds are dispersed by water, allowing it to colonize new areas along shorelines. Rhizophora candel plays a crucial role in stabilizing coastlines and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species."
