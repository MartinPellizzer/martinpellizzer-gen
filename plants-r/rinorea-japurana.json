    "intro": "Rinorea japurana, commonly known as the Brazil nut tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon Basin. It is characterized by its large, simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruit is a woody capsule that contains multiple seeds, which are the edible Brazil nuts. Rinorea japurana plays a crucial role in the ecological balance of the rainforest and is also economically significant for its nut production."
