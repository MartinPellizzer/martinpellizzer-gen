    "intro": "Rumex palustris subsp. maritimus, commonly known as seaside sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal areas of Europe and North America. It is characterized by its succulent, triangular leaves that are often red-tinged, especially along the edges. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are borne on slender, upright stalks. It thrives in saline or brackish soils, often found in marshes, salt meadows, and coastal dunes. Its ability to tolerate high salt levels makes it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
