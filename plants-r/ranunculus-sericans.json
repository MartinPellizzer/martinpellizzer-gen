    "intro": "Ranunculus sericans, commonly known as the alpine buttercup, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, bright yellow flowers with numerous petals and a hairy, glandular stem. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky soils and thrives in alpine and subalpine habitats. Its leaves are palmately lobed and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in high-altitude environments. Ranunculus sericans is a member of the Ranunculaceae family, known for its showy, often toxic flowers."
