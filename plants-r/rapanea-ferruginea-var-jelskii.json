    "intro": "Rapanea ferruginea var. jelskii, commonly known as the Jelskii's roughleaf evergreen, is a variant of the species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its leathery, dark green leaves that are often covered in a rusty or reddish bloom, giving it its scientific name. The plant is typically found in humid, tropical lowland forests, where it thrives in shaded environments. It produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, followed by small, fleshy berries. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
