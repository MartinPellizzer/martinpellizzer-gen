    "intro": "Rosa \u00d7 dumetorum f. scaphusiensis, commonly known as the scrophularioid rose, is a compact, shrub-like plant with dark green, ovate leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. Its flowers are typically pink to red, with five petals and a distinctive, narrow, tube-like shape that resembles a scrophularia, hence its common name. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits known as rose hips, which contain the seeds. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique floral form."
