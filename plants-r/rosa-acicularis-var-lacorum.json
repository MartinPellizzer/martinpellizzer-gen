    "intro": "Rosa acicularis var. lacorum, commonly known as the Lake Leman rose, is a rare and ornamental shrub native to the alpine regions of Switzerland. It is characterized by its slender, thornless stems and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Its leaves are finely divided and emit a subtle, spicy aroma when crushed. Due to its limited natural range and vulnerability to habitat loss, it is considered a protected species in its native region."
