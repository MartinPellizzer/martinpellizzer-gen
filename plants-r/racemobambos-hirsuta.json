It belongs to the grass family, Poaceae, and is characterized by its tall, slender stalks covered in fine, hairy structures. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in moist, well-drained soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its flowering structures, called racemes, bear small, inconspicuous flowers. Due to its structural characteristics, it is sometimes classified as a grass-like bamboo, showcasing a blend of botanical traits from both plant groups."
