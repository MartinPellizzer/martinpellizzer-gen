It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of delicate, pinkish-white flowers in late spring. The plant is adapted to dry, rocky habitats and is often found in coastal areas. It belongs to the Iridaceae family, which includes many ornamental and economically important plants. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
