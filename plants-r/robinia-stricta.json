    "intro": "Robinia stricta, commonly known as the narrowleaf false acacia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and have a narrow, lance-shaped appearance. The plant produces fragrant, yellowish-white flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by flat, pod-like fruits. Its bark is smooth and grayish, becoming fissured with age, and it is often used in ornamental gardening. Robinia stricta is also valued for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
