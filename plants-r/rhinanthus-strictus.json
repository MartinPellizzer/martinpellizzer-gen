    "intro": "Rhinanthus strictus, commonly known as the common yellow rattle, is an annual plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It is characterized by its yellow flowers and is often found in grassland habitats. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially depends on other plants for water and nutrients. It has slender, erect stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. Rhinanthus strictus plays a role in promoting biodiversity by reducing dominant grasses in its ecosystem."
