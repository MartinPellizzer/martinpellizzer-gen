    "intro": "Rosa \u00d7 dumetorum subvar. imitata, commonly known as the alpine rose or imitation shrub rose, is a hybrid species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense, thorny stems, which help it survive in harsh alpine environments. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink to white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its ability to retain moisture in cold climates. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays."
