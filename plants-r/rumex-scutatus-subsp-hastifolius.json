    "intro": "Rumex scutatus subsp. hastifolius, commonly known as the broadleaf sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It features basal leaves that are broadly ovate to rhombic in shape, with a distinctive wavy or serrated margin. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in dense clusters during the spring, which are borne on short pedicels. Its leaves are edible and have a tangy, sour flavor due to the presence of oxalic acid. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks."
