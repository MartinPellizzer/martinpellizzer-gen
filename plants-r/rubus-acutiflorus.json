    "intro": "Rubus acutiflorus, commonly known as the sharpflower bramble, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is native to the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are typically trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the fruit is a red, edible raspberry-like berry. Rubus acutiflorus plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing food for wildlife and supporting biodiversity."
