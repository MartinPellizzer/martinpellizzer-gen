It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves, which are typically covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are often red or yellow in color, resembling raspberries in appearance. It thrives in high-altitude environments, often growing in rocky or volcanic soils. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
