    "intro": "Rumex beringensis, commonly known as Bering's sorrel, is a perennial herb native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America and Eurasia. It typically grows in moist, rocky, or sandy soils in tundra and alpine environments. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with a reddish underside and produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats. Bering's sorrel is adapted to cold climates and can survive harsh winter conditions."
