    "intro": "Rapanea minima, commonly known as the dwarf rubber tree, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and glossy, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by small, round berries. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic qualities. Due to its slow growth and compact size, it is well-suited for container gardening and small spaces."
