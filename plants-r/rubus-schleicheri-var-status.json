    "intro": "Rubus schleicheri var. status, commonly known as the Schleicher's blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its prickly stems and compound leaves, which are typical features of the Rubus genus. The flowers are usually white or pale pink, and the fruit, a small, dark purple to black berry, is edible and often used in local cuisines. This variant is valued not only for its culinary uses but also for its ornamental qualities in gardens. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
