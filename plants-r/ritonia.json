It features showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. Ritonia thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period and low maintenance requirements."
