    "intro": "Roridula gorgonias, commonly known as the \"gum plant\" or \"gum bush,\" is a unique succulent native to South Africa. It is characterized by its sticky, glandular leaves that secrete a viscous, resin-like substance. The plant's leaves are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Roridula gorgonias is a member of the Roridulaceae family, which is closely related to the dandelion family. Its unusual morphology and adaptations make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
