    "intro": "Restrepia prorepens, commonly known as the creeping restrepia, is a species of orchid native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, humid environments with well-drained soil. The plant features a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that produce leaves and flower spikes sequentially. Its flowers are small and fragrant, often appearing in clusters during the spring or early summer. The orchid's botanical significance lies in its adaptability to high-altitude conditions and its role in local ecosystems."
