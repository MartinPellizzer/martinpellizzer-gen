    "intro": "Rubus ulmifolius subsp. insignitus, commonly known as the purple-leaf bramble, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dark purple, velvety leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces edible berries that are typically red or black in color, though they are often too tart for direct consumption. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or woodland habitats. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
