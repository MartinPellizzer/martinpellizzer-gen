    "intro": "Rubus angustisetus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved blackberry, is a species of bramble native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its slender, thorny stems and small, dark purple to black berries that ripen in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist woodlands and thickets, preferring partial shade and well-drained soil. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three oval-shaped leaflets that have serrated edges. The flowers are white and clustered in umbels, producing a fragrant aroma that attracts pollinators."
