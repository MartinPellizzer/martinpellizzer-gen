    "intro": "Ranunculus ficaria var. bulbifer, commonly known as the bulbous buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features distinctive yellow flowers with five to eight petals, often with a dark center. The plant produces bulb-like structures called tubers, which serve as storage organs and help it survive adverse conditions. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a hairy texture that distinguishes it from other ranunculus species. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks."
