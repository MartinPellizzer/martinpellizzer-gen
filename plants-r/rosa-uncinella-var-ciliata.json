    "intro": "Rosa uncinella var. ciliata, commonly known as the hairy rose or the bristly dog\u73ab\u7470, is a shrub-like species native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and thorny stems, which are often covered in fine, stiff hairs. The leaves are typically compound, with five to seven leaflets that have a serrated edge and are adorned with cilia, giving the plant its scientific name. The flowers are usually pale pink to white, with five petals and numerous stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and fragrance."
