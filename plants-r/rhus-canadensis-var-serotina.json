    "intro": "Rhus canadensis var. serotina, commonly known as staghorn sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are arranged in pairs along the stems, and its distinctive red, fuzzy fruit clusters that appear in the fall. The plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in disturbed soils, such as along roadsides or in open woodlands. Its bark is thick and rugged, giving it a staghorn appearance, and it is known for its ability to tolerate a variety of soil conditions. It plays an important role in supporting local wildlife, including birds and insects."
