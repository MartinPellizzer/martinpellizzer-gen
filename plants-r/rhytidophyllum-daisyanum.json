    "intro": "Rhytidophyllum daisyanum, commonly known as the Japanese cliff brake, is a rare fern species native to Japan. It is characterized by its distinctive, deeply lobed fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant typically grows on rocky outcrops or cliffs, where it thrives in well-drained, acidic soil. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
