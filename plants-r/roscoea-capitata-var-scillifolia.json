    "intro": "Roscoea capitata var. scillifolia, commonly known as the pink ginger or scillifolia roscoea, is a rhizomatous perennial plant native to the Himalayas. It features striking, pale pink to lavender-colored inflorescences that resemble those of the genus *Zantedeschia*. The plant has lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are slightly hairy and grow in a rosette pattern. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Due to its delicate nature, it requires partial shade and well-drained soil to flourish."
