    "intro": "Rhizophora timoriensis, commonly known as the Timor mangrove, is a species of mangrove tree native to the coastal regions of Indonesia and Papua New Guinea. It is characterized by its extensive root system, which includes prop roots that help stabilize the soil and facilitate water absorption in tidal environments. The plant thrives in saline and brackish water conditions, making it an essential component of mangrove ecosystems. Its leaves are typically small,\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), and have a waxy surface to reduce water loss. Rhizophora timoriensis plays a crucial role in coastal protection, biodiversity support, and carbon sequestration."
