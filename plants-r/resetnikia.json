    "intro": "Resetnikia, commonly known as the common resetnik, is a herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring slender stems and lance-shaped leaves with a smooth, waxy surface. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pink or white, which bloom in late summer. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, contributing to its ecological significance. Resetnikia is often found in moist meadows and along stream banks, where it thrives in well-drained, nutrient-rich soils."
