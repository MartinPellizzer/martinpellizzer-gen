    "intro": "Ranunculus curvatus, commonly known as the bent-leaved buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a basal rosette of hairy, kidney-shaped leaves that are often curled or twisted, giving it its common name. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with five to eight petal-like sepals, which are typically not true petals. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Ranunculus curvatus is known for its ability to spread through rhizomes, forming dense colonies in suitable habitats."
