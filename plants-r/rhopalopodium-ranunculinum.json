    "intro": "Rhopalopodium ranunculinum, commonly known as the yellow alpine buttercup, is a flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its bright yellow, cup-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky and alpine environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are palmately lobed, and it produces small, hairy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Rhopalopodium ranunculinum is adapted to harsh mountain climates and plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators."
