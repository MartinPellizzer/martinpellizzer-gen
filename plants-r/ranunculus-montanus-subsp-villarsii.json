    "intro": "Ranunculus montanus subsp. villarsii, commonly known as the Alpine buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine meadows, where it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. The plant features showy yellow flowers with five petals, often surrounded by a ring of sepals that resemble additional petals. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a distinctive hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in high-altitude environments. This subspecies is noted for its ecological importance in supporting pollinators and maintaining biodiversity in alpine ecosystems."
