    "intro": "Rumex \u00d7 bontei, commonly known as the hybrid sorrel, is a perennial plant that results from the cross between Rumex acetosa (common sorrel) and Rumex acetobulus (bog sorrel). It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves with a reddish or purple underside, which are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and damp meadows. Due to its hybrid nature, Rumex \u00d7 bontei exhibits a mix of traits from both parent species, making it a unique example of natural hybridization in the Rumex genus."
