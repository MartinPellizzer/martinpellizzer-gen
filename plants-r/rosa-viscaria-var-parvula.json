It features small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink, blooming in clusters throughout the growing season. The plant has a trailing growth habit, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it produces small, hairy fruits known as rose hips. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardy nature in cooler climates."
