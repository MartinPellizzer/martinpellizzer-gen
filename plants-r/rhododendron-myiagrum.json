    "intro": "Rhododendron myiagrum, commonly known as the Myia-groom rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in acidic, well-drained soils and thrives in partial to full shade. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, providing a striking contrast to its vibrant floral displays. Rhododendron myiagrum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in cooler, humid climates."
