    "intro": "Rubus aliceae, commonly known as Alice's rosehip bramble, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, red berries that mature in the fall. The plant produces white to pale pink flowers in early summer, which are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the plant thrives in well-drained, acidic soils. Rubus aliceae is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been studied for its potential medicinal properties."
