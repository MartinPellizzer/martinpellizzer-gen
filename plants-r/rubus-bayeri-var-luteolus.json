    "intro": "Rubus bayeri var. luteolus, commonly known as the yellow-stemmed blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to certain regions of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, yellowish stems and small, aggregate fruits that are typically reddish or black when mature. The plant produces trifoliate leaves with serrated edges and has thorny stems typical of the Rubus genus. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges or disturbed soils. Its botanical features make it distinct from other Rubus species, particularly in its coloration and growth habits."
