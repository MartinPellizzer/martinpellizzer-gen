    "intro": "Rhus incisa, commonly known as the smooth sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and turn vibrant red in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in upright clusters, followed by red, fuzzy fruits that are an important food source for wildlife. Rhus incisa thrives in full sun to partial shade and is adapted to a variety of soil types. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to tolerate urban conditions."
