    "intro": "Rubus modrensis, commonly known as the Modren blackberry, is a species of brambles native to the temperate regions of South America. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves, typical of the Rubus genus. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
