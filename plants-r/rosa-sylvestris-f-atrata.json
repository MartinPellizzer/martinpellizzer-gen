    "intro": "Rosa sylvestris f. atrata, commonly known as the black rose, is a rare and striking variant of the wild rose. It is characterized by its deep, almost black petals that contrast with its vibrant red or pink hues. This form is a natural mutation of the species Rosa sylvestris, often found in shaded, moist environments. The plant typically has thorny stems and fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring. Its unique coloration makes it a prized specimen in botanical gardens and among rose enthusiasts."
