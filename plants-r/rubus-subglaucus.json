    "intro": "Rubus subglaucus, commonly known as the smooth bramble, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its thorny stems and trifoliate leaves, which are typically covered in a fine, smooth texture. The plant produces small, white to pink flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red or black berries in the fall. Native to parts of Asia and Europe, it thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodlands and scrublands. Its berries are edible but can be quite tart, and the plant is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
