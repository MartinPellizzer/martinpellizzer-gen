It belongs to the Rutaceae family and is characterized by its small, blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has finely divided, aromatic leaves that emit a strong, bitter scent. Ruta versicolor is often found in dry, rocky soils and can thrive in disturbed habitats. It is used in traditional medicine for its purported antispasmodic and anti-inflammatory properties."
