It is characterized by its vibrant pink to magenta flowers that bloom in dense, fan-like clusters. The plant features slender, upright stems and heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Russelia laciniata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its showy, long-lasting blooms."
