    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 emeritus, commonly known as the hybrid blackberry raspberry, is a deciduous shrub belonging to the Rosaceae family. It is a natural hybrid between Rubus ursinus (evergreen raspberry) and Rubus  chamaemorus (cloudberry), resulting in a plant with unique botanical characteristics. The plant typically grows in temperate regions, thriving in moist, acidic soils and partial shade. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or black in color. The hybrid is valued for its ornamental qualities and edible fruits, which have a distinct flavor profile combining elements of both parent species."
