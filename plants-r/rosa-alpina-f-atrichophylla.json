    "intro": "Rosa alpina f. atrichophylla, commonly known as the Alpine rose, is a botanical variant of the alpine rose species. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and is native to mountainous regions of Europe. The plant typically features simple, trifoliate leaves that are often densely hairy, though the specific form 'atrichophylla' is noted for its reduced hairiness. Its flowers are usually pink to red, with five petals, and bloom in late spring to early summer. This subspecies is well adapted to cold, rocky environments and is often found in alpine meadows and scree slopes."
