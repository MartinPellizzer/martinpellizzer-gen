It is characterized by its dense, woolly gray foliage and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of pink to white. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soil and full sun. Its leaves are covered in a thick layer of fine hairs, which help to retain moisture and protect against harsh environmental conditions. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in challenging climates."
