    "intro": "Ranunculus glaber f. prostratus, commonly known as the prostrate smooth buttercup, is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial native to parts of Europe. It features small, yellow flowers with five petals and numerous stamens, typical of the Ranunculaceae family. The plant has a prostrate habit, with stems that lie close to the ground, often forming a dense mat. Its leaves are simple, heart-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This variant is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in moist, shady conditions."
