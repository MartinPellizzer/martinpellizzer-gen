    "intro": "Rhynchospora macrochaeta var. macrochaeta, commonly known as the long-hair sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, characterized by its grass-like appearance and three-ranked leaves. The plant features dense, spike-like inflorescences that produce small, three-lobed flowers, typically green to reddish in color. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense stands, contributing to soil stabilization in moist environments. The variety macrochaeta is distinguished by its elongated, hairy bracts and robust floral structures."
