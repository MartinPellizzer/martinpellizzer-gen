It is characterized by its vibrant red flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. The plant has woody stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. It thrives in sandy soils and is adapted to salt spray from the ocean, making it a resilient species in coastal ecosystems. Its botanical features make it an important component of the local flora and a subject of interest for botanists and horticulturists."
