    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 aciphylloides, commonly known as the hybrid raspberry or a type of bramble, is a deciduous shrub native to the temperate regions of the Americas. It is a natural hybrid between Rubus ursinus (blackberry) and Rubus chamaemorus (cloudberry), resulting in a plant with unique botanical characteristics. The plant features thorny stems, compound leaves with serrated edges, and small, aggregate fruits that are typically yellow or orange in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along streambanks. Its ornamental value and edible fruits make it a notable species in horticulture and ecological studies."
