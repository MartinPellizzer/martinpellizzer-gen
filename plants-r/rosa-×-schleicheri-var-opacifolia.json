    "intro": "Rosa \u00d7 schleicheri var. opacifolia, commonly known as the Opacifolia Rose, is a hybrid shrub native to China. It features upright growth with thorny stems and dark green, leathery leaves that are glossy and slightly waxy. The plant produces fragrant, semi-double flowers in shades of pink to red, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It is well-suited for gardens due to its hardiness and ornamental value. The varietal name \"opacifolia\" refers to its thick, opaque foliage, which distinguishes it from other rose varieties."
