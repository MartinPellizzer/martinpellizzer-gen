    "intro": "Ranunculus paludosus var. flavescens, commonly known as the yellow marsh buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland habitats in North America. It features delicate, yellow flowers with five petals and a hairy, ribbed stem that often grows up to 30 cm tall. The plant has palmately divided leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, aiding in its identification. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Due to its preference for wet environments, it plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for various insects and small aquatic organisms."
