    "intro": "Rhus hirta var. dissecta, commonly known as the dissected sumac, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves that are finely divided, giving it a feathery appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by red, fuzzy berries that attract birds. Its growth habit is typically upright, with multiple stems forming a dense, bushy form. The leaves and berries contain compounds that have been used in traditional medicine for their astringent properties."
