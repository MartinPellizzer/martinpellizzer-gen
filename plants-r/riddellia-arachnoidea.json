    "intro": "Riddellia arachnoidea, commonly known as the spider-plant or spider vine, is a flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and clusters of small, white, spider-like flowers. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible but not particularly palatable. It thrives in humid, tropical environments and is often used in ornamental gardening. Its unique appearance and adaptability make it a popular choice for hanging baskets and trellises."
