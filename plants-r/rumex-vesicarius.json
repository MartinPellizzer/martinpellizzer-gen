    "intro": "Rumex vesicarius, commonly known as bladder campion, is a herbaceous plant belonging to the Polygonaceae family. It is characterized by its upright, branching stems and alternate, lance-shaped leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are typically borne on terminal panicles. Its distinctive feature is the presence of inflated, bladder-like structures at the base of the leaves, which are filled with air and help in buoyancy. Rumex vesicarius is often found in moist, calcareous soils in meadows and along stream banks."
