    "intro": "Ranunculus repens var. elatior, commonly known as the greater floating buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers with five petals and a distinctive central cluster of stamens. The plant typically grows in wet or muddy areas, such as marshes and pond edges, and is often found in shallow water. Its leaves are palmately divided and have a waxy coating that helps repel water. The species is known for its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes, making it a common sight in aquatic environments."
