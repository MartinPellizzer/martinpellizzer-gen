    "intro": "Rhinanthus grandiflorus, commonly known as the common yellow toadflax, is a flowering plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom from June to August. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as grasslands and roadsides. Rhinanthus grandiflorus is often found in the UK and parts of Europe, where it plays a role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
