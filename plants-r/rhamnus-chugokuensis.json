It belongs to the Rhamnaceae family and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on top and pale underneath. The plant produces small yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by black, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds and some mammals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in forest edges and rocky areas. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological studies and traditional medicine."
