    "intro": "Rhynchospora polyphylla var. contracta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved tussock sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in marshes, bogs, and other moist environments, where it forms dense tussocks with rhizomes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often compressed and have a prominent midrib. Its inflorescence consists of a cylindrical spike with small, three-lobed flowers that are usually pale green to brownish in color. This species plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates and birds."
