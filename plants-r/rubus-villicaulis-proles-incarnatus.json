    "intro": "Rubus villicaulis proles incarnatus, commonly known as the red-stemmed blackberry, is a shrub native to the temperate regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its thorny stems, which are often reddish in color, and its compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits known as drupes, which are typically dark purple to black in color when ripe. These fruits are edible, though they are often described as having a tart and slightly astringent flavor. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is commonly found in woodland edges and disturbed areas."
