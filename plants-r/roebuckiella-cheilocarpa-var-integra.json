    "intro": "Roebuckiella cheilocarpa var. integra, commonly known as the smooth-lobed roebuckiella, is a rare and lesser-known member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. The leaves are typically ovate to lanceolate, with smooth margins and a slightly hairy underside. This variant is distinguished by its more uniform leaf structure compared to other varieties within the species. It thrives in moist, temperate climates and is often found in shaded woodland areas."
