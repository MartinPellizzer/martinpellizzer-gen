    "intro": "Richardia albomaculata, commonly known as the white-spotted morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, often with a distinctive white or pale spot near the base. The plant produces heart-shaped leaves that are typically smooth and have a slightly hairy texture. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found growing along riverbanks or in wetlands. The seeds are enclosed in a fleshy, orange-colored capsule that splits open when mature to release the seeds."
