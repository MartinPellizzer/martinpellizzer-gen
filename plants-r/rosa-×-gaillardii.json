It is characterized by its ability to produce flowers continuously throughout the growing season, making it a popular choice for gardens. The plant typically grows as an upright shrub with thorny stems and dark green, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are usually pink to red in color, with a fragrant scent, and they bloom in clusters. Rosa \u00d7 gaillardii is well adapted to a variety of soil types and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
