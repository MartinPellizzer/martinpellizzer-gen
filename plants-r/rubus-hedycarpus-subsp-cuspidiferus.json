It is characterized by its thorny stems and trifoliate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, edible berries in the summer. Its fruit is often used in jams and preserves due to its tart flavor. The species is adapted to moist, woodland habitats and plays a role in supporting local wildlife."
