    "intro": "Ribes petraeum var. bullatum, commonly known as the alpine gooseberry, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, thorny growth habit and small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in early summer, which are followed by small, edible berries that are typically red or orange in color. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in gardens with suitable conditions."
