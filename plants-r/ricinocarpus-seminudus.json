    "intro": "Ricinocarpus seminudus, commonly known as the naked-seeded sea hakea, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a small shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss in coastal environments. The fruit is a capsule that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by wind."
