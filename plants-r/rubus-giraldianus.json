    "intro": "Rubus giraldianus, commonly known as the Giraldian blackberry, is a species of brambles native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems, compound leaves, and aggregate fruits that develop from multiple ovaria. The plant produces dark purple to black berries that are often used in local cuisines and traditional medicine. It thrives in temperate climates and prefers well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species in the Rubus genus."
