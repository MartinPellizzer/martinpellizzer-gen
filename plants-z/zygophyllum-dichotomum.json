    "intro": "Zygophyllum dichotomum, commonly known as the two-branched sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia and Africa. It is a low-growing shrub with a distinctive branching pattern, where each stem divides into two equal parts, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the warmer months. Its leaves are typically small, scale-like, and adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Zygophyllum dichotomum is well-suited to sandy soils and is often found in desert or coastal dune habitats."
