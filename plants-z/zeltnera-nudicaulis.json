    "intro": "Zeltnera nudicaulis, commonly known as the naked-stemmed zeltnera, is a rare flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, often hairless stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces delicate, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is typically found in arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive species in conservation efforts."
