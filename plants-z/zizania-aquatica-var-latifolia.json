    "intro": "Zizania aquatica var. latifolia, commonly known as broadleaf wild rice, is a perennial aquatic plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its broad, grass-like leaves that can grow up to 30 inches in length. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, rice-like grains, which are edible and historically harvested by Native American communities. It thrives in shallow, freshwater habitats such as marshes and slow-moving streams. Its presence is often indicative of healthy wetland ecosystems."
