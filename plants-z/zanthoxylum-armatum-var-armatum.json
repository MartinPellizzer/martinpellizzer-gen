    "intro": "Zanthoxylum armatum var. armatum, commonly known as the prickly ash or simply prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and often have a serrated edge. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for some wildlife but toxic to humans. Its bark and twigs contain compounds with historical use in traditional medicine. The plant is also notable for its defensive spines, which deter herbivores and contribute to its ecological role in its native habitat."
