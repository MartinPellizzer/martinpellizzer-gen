    "intro": "Zosima absinthiifolia var. radians, commonly known as the radiant zosima, is a rare and striking plant characterized by its distinctive, finely divided, silver-green foliage. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, sharing structural similarities with other members of the carrot family, such as its umbel-like inflorescence. The plant is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, where it thrives in cool, moist, and well-drained soils. Its leaves are often described as having a metallic sheen, which enhances its ornamental appeal. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
