    "intro": "Zexmenia oyedaeoides, commonly known as the Nigerian violet, is a rare flowering plant native to the rainforests of Nigeria. It belongs to the Violaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, violet-colored petals and lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and has a compact, shrub-like appearance. Its flowers bloom during the wet season, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to habitat loss, Zexmenia oyedaeoides is considered endangered and is of significant botanical interest for its unique morphology and ecological role."
