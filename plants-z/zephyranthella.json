    "intro": "Zephyranthella, commonly known as the fairy lantern, is a genus of flowering plants native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. These plants are characterized by their striking, showy flowers that resemble small lanterns, typically appearing in shades of yellow, orange, and red. Zephyranthella species are generally herbaceous perennials, with some species growing as annuals, and they often thrive in rocky or sandy soils. The flowers are usually borne on slender stems and are pollinated by insects, particularly bees and flies. Due to their unique appearance and habitat preferences, Zephyranthella species are of interest to botanists and gardeners alike."
