    "intro": "Zigadenus angustifolius, commonly known as narrowleaf death camas, is a toxic plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Melanthiaceae family and features showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces a distinctive, clustered inflorescence. It is highly poisonous, containing various toxic alkaloids that can be lethal to both humans and animals. Due to its toxicity, it is often mistaken for edible plants like true camas, making it a significant hazard in its native habitat."
