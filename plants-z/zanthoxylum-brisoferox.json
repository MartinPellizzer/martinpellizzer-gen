    "intro": "Zanthoxylum brisoferox, commonly known as the fiery prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often feather-like and have a distinctive, aromatic scent. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that give way to red, berry-like fruits in the fall. Its bark and leaves contain compounds used in traditional medicine for their stimulating and analgesic properties. Zanthoxylum brisoferox is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
