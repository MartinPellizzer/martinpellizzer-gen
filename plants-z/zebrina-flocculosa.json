    "intro": "Zebrina flocculosa, commonly known as the white-flowered water lily, is a tropical aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It features broad, rounded leaves that float on the water surface, with a waxy texture and a white or pale green color. The plant produces showy, white flowers that open in the early morning and close by midday. Its roots are anchored in the mud at the bottom of still water bodies, and it thrives in warm, shallow waters with ample sunlight. Zebrina flocculosa is often cultivated in ponds and water gardens for its ornamental value."
