    "intro": "Zygia divaricata, commonly known as the zigzag vine, is a climbing plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive zigzagging stems, which help it climb and support itself on structures. The plant produces small, pale green flowers that are often overlooked due to their modest appearance. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a slightly rough texture. Zygia divaricata is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to cover trellises or walls."
