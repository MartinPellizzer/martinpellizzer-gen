    "intro": "Zamia verschaffeltii, commonly known as the Verschaffelt's cycad, is a rare and ancient plant belonging to the Cycadaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, particularly in Brazil. This plant is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnate leaves that can reach several meters in length. Zamia verschaffeltii is dioecious, meaning it has separate male and female plants, and it produces cones rather than flowers. Due to its rarity and habitat loss, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
