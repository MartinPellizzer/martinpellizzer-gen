    "intro": "Zornia reticulata, commonly known as the net-veined zornia, is a herbaceous annual plant native to the Americas. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in prairies and along stream banks. Its seed pods are hairy and contain several elliptical seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Zornia reticulata is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
