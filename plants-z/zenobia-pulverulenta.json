    "intro": "Zenobia pulverulenta, commonly known as the eastern prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its spiny stems and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with thick, fleshy stems that store water. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it produces edible fruits known as \"prickly pears.\" The plant plays an important role in its ecosystem, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
