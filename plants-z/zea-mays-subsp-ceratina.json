    "intro": "Zea mays subsp. ceratina, commonly known as the Mexican corn or teosinte, is a wild grass species native to Mexico and Central America. It is characterized by its narrow, hairless leaves and compact inflorescence with small, spike-like flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 1\u20132 meters and produces small, hard grains enclosed in a tough husk. It is considered a wild relative of modern corn and has been studied for its genetic diversity and potential for crop improvement. Its botanical features make it an important subject in agricultural and evolutionary research."
