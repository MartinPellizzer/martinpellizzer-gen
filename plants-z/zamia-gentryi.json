    "intro": "Zamia gentryi, commonly known as the Gentry's cycad, is a member of the Zamiaceae family and is native to the southern United States, particularly Texas. It is a dioecious plant, meaning that male and female reproductive structures are found on separate individuals. The plant produces cones, with male cones releasing pollen and female cones developing into seed-bearing structures. Its foliage consists of large, pinnately compound leaves that are typically evergreen. Zamia gentryi is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in warm climates for its unique appearance."
