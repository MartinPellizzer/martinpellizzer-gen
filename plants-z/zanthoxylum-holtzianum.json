    "intro": "Zanthoxylum holtzianum, commonly known as the Mexican prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Rutaceae family, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its spiny stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that give way to red, berry-like fruits in the fall. Zanthoxylum holtzianum is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and ecologically important species in its native habitats."
