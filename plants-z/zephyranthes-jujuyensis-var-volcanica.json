It produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of white and pink, often blooming after rainfall. The plant is adapted to thrive in volcanic soils, which provide essential nutrients and drainage. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge from a central bulb. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to bloom in challenging, arid environments."
