    "intro": "Zanthoxylum acanthopodium, commonly known as the prickly ash or Indian prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 4 to 10 inches long and composed of 5 to 11 pairs of elliptic, serrated leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by bright red, berry-like fruits that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife. Its bark and twigs are often used in traditional herbal medicine for their stimulant and analgesic properties. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodland edges and stream banks."
