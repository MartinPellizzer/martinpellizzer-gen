    "intro": "Zombia, commonly known as the zombie plant, is a fictional plant often depicted in horror media as a parasitic species that consumes human tissue. In botanical terms, it is not a real plant but a creative concept that mimics the characteristics of certain carnivorous plants. Its \"botanical\" features are typically described as having tendrils that wrap around victims and absorb nutrients through a process resembling photosynthesis. While no such plant exists in the natural world, it is often compared to real species like the Venus flytrap or pitcher plants. The plant's fictional biology serves as a metaphor for parasitism and decay in popular culture."
