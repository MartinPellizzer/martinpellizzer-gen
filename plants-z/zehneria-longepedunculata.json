    "intro": "Zehneria longepedunculata, commonly known as the long peduncle zehneria, is a rare and striking member of the Araliaceae family. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically a deep green with a glossy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by bright red berries that are attractive to birds. Native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
