    "intro": "Zeltnera martini, commonly known as the San Diego milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California. It is a member of the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its showy, pink to reddish-orange flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal scrub and chaparral habitats, thriving in well-drained soils. Its leaves are opposite and lance-shaped, with a rough texture, and it produces capsule fruits that contain toxic seeds. Zeltnera martini plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for native pollinators."
