It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family, which includes buttercups and other flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit, with small, lance-shaped leaves and delicate, yellowish flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species."
