    "intro": "Zanthoxylum montanum, commonly known as the mountain prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 4 to 6 inches long and composed of 5 to 9 pairs of oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into red, fleshy berries in the fall. Its bark and berries contain compounds that have been used traditionally for their medicinal properties. Zanthoxylum montanum thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and stream valleys."
