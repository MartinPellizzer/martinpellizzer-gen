It is a tall, annual grass that typically grows to heights of 2 to 4 meters. The plant features narrow, elongated leaves and produces tassels at the top of its stem, which are characteristic of the grass family. Its seeds are enclosed in small, hard grains, similar to other members of the Zea genus. This plant is adapted to the unique climate of the Canary Islands, exhibiting traits that allow it to thrive in volcanic soils and coastal conditions."
