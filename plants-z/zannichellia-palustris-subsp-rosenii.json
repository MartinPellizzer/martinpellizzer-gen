    "intro": "Zannichellia palustris subsp. rosenii, commonly known as the Ros\u00e9n's water starwort, is a aquatic plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds, ditches, and marshes. The plant has narrow, ribbon-like leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in nutrient-rich waters and its tolerance to varying water conditions. This subspecies is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems."
