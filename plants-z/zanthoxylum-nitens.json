    "intro": "Zanthoxylum nitens, commonly known as the Chinese prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to East Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often pinnately arranged and have serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by red, berry-like fruits. Its bark and leaves contain compounds such as alkaloids and flavonoids, which have been studied for their medicinal properties. Zanthoxylum nitens is often used in traditional Chinese medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects."
