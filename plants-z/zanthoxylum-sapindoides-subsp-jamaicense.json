    "intro": "Zanthoxylum sapindoides subsp. jamaicense, commonly known as Jamaican prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 5-7 pairs of ovate to lanceolate leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for some animals but generally considered bitter by humans. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The species is valued for its ornamental qualities and has traditional uses in local medicine."
