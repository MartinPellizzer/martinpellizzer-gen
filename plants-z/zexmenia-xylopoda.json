    "intro": "Zexmenia xylopoda, commonly known as the African sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the branches. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by woody, aromatic seeds. Zexmenia xylopoda is valued for its essential oils, which are used in perfumery and traditional medicine. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
