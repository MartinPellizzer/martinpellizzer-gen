It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically feature a deep red lip and a white or pale pink upper lip. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with each pseudobulb producing a pair of leaves and a flowering stem. Its flowers are often fragrant and attract various pollinators, including bees and butterflies. Zygopetalum caulescens is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
