    "intro": "Zanthoxylum carolinianum var. fruticosum, commonly known as the prickly ash or Carolina prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 4 to 8 inches long and have serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for humans and wildlife. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and thickets. The plant's aromatic leaves and bark contain compounds that have been used in traditional medicine."
