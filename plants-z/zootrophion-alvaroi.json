    "intro": "Zootrophion alvaroi, commonly known as the Alvaroi's zootroph, is a rare and specialized plant adapted to extreme environments. It possesses a unique root system that allows it to extract nutrients from nutrient-poor soils. The plant exhibits a succulent structure, enabling it to store water in arid conditions. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, often displaying vivid colors to attract specific pollinators. Due to its limited habitat, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native region."
