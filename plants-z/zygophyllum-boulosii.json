    "intro": "Zygophyllum boulosii, commonly known as the desert morning glory, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa. It is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and its ability to thrive in harsh, drought-prone environments. The plant has small, pinnately compound leaves and produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds. It is well adapted to sandy soils and can survive with minimal water. Its botanical features make it an important component of desert flora and a subject of study in ecological and botanical research."
