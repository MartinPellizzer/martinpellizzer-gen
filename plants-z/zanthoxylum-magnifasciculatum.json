    "intro": "Zanthoxylum magnifasciculatum, commonly known as the showy prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves with serrated margins and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in the spring. The plant produces bright red berries that are an important food source for birds and wildlife. Its bark and leaves contain compounds used in traditional medicine for their purported antiseptic and analgesic properties. Zanthoxylum magnifasciculatum is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and other moist habitats."
