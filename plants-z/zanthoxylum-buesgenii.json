    "intro": "Zanthoxylum buesgenii, commonly known as the Buesgen prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Rutaceae family, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces bright red berries that are edible for humans and birds, though they are often mistaken for toxic species. Its bark and leaves contain compounds with potential medicinal properties, making it of interest in ethnobotanical studies. Zanthoxylum buesgenii is typically found in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or swampy areas."
