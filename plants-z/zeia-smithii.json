    "intro": "Zeia smithii, commonly known as the Smith's zeia, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue-violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves and thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil. It is known for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in botanical gardens. Due to habitat loss, Zeia smithii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
