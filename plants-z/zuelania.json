    "intro": "Zuelania, commonly known as the arrowroot plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It consists of several species, most notably Zuelania hirta, which is native to the tropical regions of the Americas. The plant is characterized by its palm-like appearance, with large, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white or pink flowers. Its roots are used to produce a starchy, edible substance similar to arrowroot starch. Zuelania is often cultivated for both ornamental purposes and for its nutritional value."
