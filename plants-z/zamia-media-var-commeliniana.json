    "intro": "Zamia media var. commeliniana, commonly known as the commeliniana cycad, is a member of the Zamiaceae family and is native to tropical regions of South America. This plant is a slow-growing, evergreen cycad characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnately compound leaves. The leaves are typically dark green and can reach lengths of up to 2 meters, giving the plant a distinctive, ancient appearance. It produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. Due to its ornamental value and slow growth rate, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
