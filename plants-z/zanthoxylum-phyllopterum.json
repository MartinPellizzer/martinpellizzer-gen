    "intro": "Zanthoxylum phyllopterum, commonly known as the Mexican prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Rutaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves with leaflets that are often covered in small, stiff hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by bright red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain birds and animals. Its bark and leaves have been used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal due to its vibrant foliage and unique appearance."
