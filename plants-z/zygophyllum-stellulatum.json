    "intro": "Zygophyllum stellulatum, commonly known as the star-scale buckthorn, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia and Africa. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, showcasing its adaptability to harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually small, scale-like, and arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps reduce water loss. Zygophyllum stellulatum is also known for its ability to thrive in extreme temperatures and low precipitation, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems."
