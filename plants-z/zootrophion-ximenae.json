    "intro": "Zootrophion ximenae, commonly known as the Mexican orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pale pink. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Zootrophion ximenae is considered endangered and is often found in protected botanical gardens."
