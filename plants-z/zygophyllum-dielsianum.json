    "intro": "Zygophyllum dielsianum, commonly known as the desert morning glory, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its small, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the early morning, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its deep root system allows it to access groundwater, making it well adapted to drought conditions. Zygophyllum dielsianum is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties."
