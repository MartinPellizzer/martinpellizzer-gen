    "intro": "Zenkerella egregia, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a shrub-like plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its thick, succulent stems that store water, enabling it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically green or yellow, and it has palmate leaves with five to seven lobes. Its latex, which is milky and viscous, is used in traditional medicine and has potential applications in modern pharmacology. Zenkerella egregia is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a decorative plant."
