    "intro": "Zosima komarovii, commonly known as the Komarov's zosima, is a rare and lesser-known plant species belonging to the family Ericaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, where it thrives in cool, humid climates. The plant features dense, evergreen foliage with small, leathery leaves that are typically arranged in whorls. Its flowers are usually pink or white, and it produces small, dark berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Zosima komarovii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
