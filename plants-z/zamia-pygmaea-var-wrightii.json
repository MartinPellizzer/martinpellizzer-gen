    "intro": "Zamia pygmaea var. wrightii, commonly known as the dwarf cycad, is a unique plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Zamiaceae family and is characterized by its compact size and distinctive, palm-like foliage. The plant has a short, stout trunk and produces cycad-like cones rather than flowers. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and prefers partial to full sun exposure. Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
