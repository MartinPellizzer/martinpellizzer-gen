It belongs to the Rutaceae family, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces yellowish-green berries that are typically consumed by birds and other wildlife, aiding in seed dispersal. Zanthoxylum trinitense is valued for its ornamental qualities and has traditional uses in local medicine. Its thorny structure and aromatic foliage make it a distinctive feature in its natural habitat."
