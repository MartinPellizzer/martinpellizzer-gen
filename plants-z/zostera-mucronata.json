    "intro": "Zostera mucronata, commonly known as the narrow leaf eelgrass, is a marine flowering plant found in coastal regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its long, ribbon-like leaves that are typically less than 1 cm wide. This species thrives in shallow, sandy or muddy substrates in intertidal zones and is often found in areas with moderate to strong water currents. Zostera mucronata plays an important role in coastal ecosystems by providing habitat for various marine organisms. It also contributes to sediment stabilization and nutrient cycling in marine environments."
