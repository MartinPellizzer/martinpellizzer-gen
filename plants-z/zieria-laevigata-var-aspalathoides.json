    "intro": "Zieria laevigata var. aspalathoides, commonly known as the white-flowered zieria, is a perennial shrub native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its small, glossy, ovate leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stems. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in spring, adding ornamental value to gardens. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or coastal landscapes. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species requiring conservation efforts."
