    "intro": "Zexmenia palmeri, commonly known as the desert lily, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as deserts and rocky soils. The plant features a basal rosette of thick, fleshy leaves that help store water, a key adaptation to its harsh habitat. Its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers are usually white or pale purple, and they bloom in the spring. Zexmenia palmeri is well adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and drought conditions."
