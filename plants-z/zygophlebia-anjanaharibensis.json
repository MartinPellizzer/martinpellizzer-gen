    "intro": "Zygophlebia anjanaharibensis, commonly known as the Madagascar star-moss, is a rare and endemic plant species found exclusively in the rainforests of Madagascar. It belongs to the family Zygophyllaceae and is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring small, clustered leaves and a distinctive flowering structure. The plant is adapted to the humid, shaded understory environments of its native habitat, where it thrives in nutrient-poor soils. Its flowers are typically small and yellowish, contributing to its role in local pollination networks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Zygophlebia anjanaharibensis is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and climate change."
