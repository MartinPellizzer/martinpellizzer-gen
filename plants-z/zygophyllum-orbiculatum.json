    "intro": "Zygophyllum orbiculatum, commonly known as the roundleaf sandmat, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fleshy, succulent leaves and small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is adapted to harsh environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems and leaves. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access moisture from deeper soil layers. Zygophyllum orbiculatum plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
