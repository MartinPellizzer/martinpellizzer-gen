    "intro": "Zehneria repanda, commonly known as the spiral fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, spirally arranged fronds that give it a unique and elegant appearance. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are pinnately divided, with a glossy green surface and a soft, feathery texture. Zehneria repanda is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in hanging baskets or as a houseplant."
