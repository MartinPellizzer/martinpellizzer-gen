    "intro": "Zygophyllum englerianum, commonly known as the Engler's zig-zag plant, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, zig-zagging stems that help reduce water loss through transpiration. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in dense inflorescences, which bloom during the dry season. Its leaves are small, linear, and often covered with a waxy cuticle to minimize water evaporation. Zygophyllum englerianum is adapted to survive in harsh, drought-prone environments, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems."
