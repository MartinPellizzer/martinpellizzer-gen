It features a distinctive, leaf-like appearance with a textured, rugose surface that gives it its scientific name. This plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments, often near water bodies. Its botanical structure suggests a possible evolutionary link to early land plants, showcasing adaptations for aquatic and semi-aquatic habitats. The species is of interest to botanists due to its primitive features and potential role in understanding plant evolution."
