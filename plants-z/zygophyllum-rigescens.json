    "intro": "Zygophyllum rigescens, commonly known as the rigid sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial shrub with slender, branching stems that often appear woody and rigid. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are typically small, linear, and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, helping to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Zygophyllum rigescens is adapted to sandy soils and is often found in desert scrub and creosote bush communities."
