It is characterized by its small, yellowish-green berries and dense, thorny foliage. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to saline and arid environments. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Ziziphus circumscissa plays an important ecological role by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
