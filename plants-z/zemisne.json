    "intro": "Zemisne, commonly known as the common tansy, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in moist meadows and along stream banks. Zemisne contains various volatile oils and sesquiterpene lactones, which contribute to its strong aroma and medicinal properties. However, it is also toxic to livestock and should be handled with care."
