    "intro": "Zamioculcas lanceolata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf ZZ plant, is a member of the Araceae family and is native to eastern Africa. It is characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped leaves that are glossy and arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are followed by bright orange berries. It is a low-maintenance plant that thrives in low light conditions and requires minimal watering. Its ability to store water in its thick, fleshy stems makes it highly drought-tolerant."
