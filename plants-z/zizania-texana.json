    "intro": "Zizania texana, commonly known as Texas wild rice, is a perennial grass native to the wetlands of the southern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and small, rice-like seeds that mature in the fall. The plant thrives in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes and along the edges of lakes and rivers. Its leaves are narrow and blade-like, with a smooth texture and a slight sheen. Zizania texana plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
