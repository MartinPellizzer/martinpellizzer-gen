    "intro": "Zosterophyllanthos dilemma, commonly known as the coastal zosterophyllum, is a rare flowering plant native to specific coastal regions. It is characterized by its unique leaf morphology, featuring narrow, linear leaves arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or pale yellow, adapted to thrive in saline and windy environments. It has a shallow root system that allows it to anchor in sandy or rocky soils near the shoreline. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Zosterophyllanthos dilemma is considered endangered in many areas."
