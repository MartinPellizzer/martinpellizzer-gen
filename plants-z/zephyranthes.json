    "intro": "Zephyranthes, commonly known as the rainflower or fairy lantern, is a genus of flowering plants in the Amaryllis family. These plants are native to the Americas, particularly Central and South America, and are known for their delicate, bell-shaped blooms. Zephyranthes species typically thrive in well-drained soil and prefer full sun to partial shade. They are often cultivated for their ornamental value and ability to bloom during the rainy season. Many species are also drought-tolerant, making them suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
