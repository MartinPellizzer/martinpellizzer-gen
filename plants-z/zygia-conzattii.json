    "intro": "Zygia conzattii, commonly known as the Conzatti's zygia, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions in South America. It belongs to the Zygia genus within the family Cucurbitaceae, which includes vines and climbers. The plant is characterized by its slender, trailing stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and have a rough texture, while its fruit is a small, oval-shaped capsule that contains seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Zygia conzattii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
