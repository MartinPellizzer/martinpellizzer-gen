    "intro": "Zelkova carpinifolia subsp. yomraensis, commonly known as the Yomra zelkova, is a rare and endemic species native to Turkey. It is a deciduous tree characterized by its smooth, grey-brown bark and elliptical, serrated leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by small, winged fruits. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forested areas with well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
