    "intro": "Zealandia, commonly known as the South Pacific's largest submerged continent, is a unique botanical region characterized by its diverse marine and coastal ecosystems. It encompasses a vast area of seafloor that was once above water during the last ice age, leading to the evolution of distinct plant communities. The flora includes hardy coastal plants, seagrasses, and mangroves that thrive in the intertidal zones and shallow waters. Due to its submerged nature, much of Zealandia's vegetation remains unexplored, offering potential for new botanical discoveries. Its ecological significance lies in its role as a habitat for endemic species and its contribution to the region's biodiversity."
