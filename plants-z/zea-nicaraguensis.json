    "intro": "Zea nicaraguensis, commonly known as the Nicaraguan maize, is a wild relative of modern corn. It is native to Central America and is characterized by its tall, robust stalks and large, tassel-like inflorescences. The plant produces small, yellowish grains that are encased in a tough husk. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is typically found in lowland areas with well-drained soil. Due to its genetic diversity, it is of interest to researchers studying crop improvement and plant genetics."
