    "intro": "Zieria wilhelminae, commonly known as the Wilhelmina's zieria, is a small, shrub-like plant native to the coastal regions of southeastern Australia. It belongs to the family Epacridaceae and is characterized by its compact growth habit and aromatic foliage. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine, silvery hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Zieria wilhelminae is well adapted to sandy soils and is often found in heathland and coastal scrub environments."
