    "intro": "Zanthoxylum oahuense, commonly known as the Oahu prickly ash, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Hawaiian island of Oahu. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often covered in fine, stiff hairs, and its clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces red, berry-like fruits that are an important food source for native birds and insects. It thrives in coastal and lowland habitats, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
