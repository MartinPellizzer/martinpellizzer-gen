    "intro": "Zapoteca tehuana, commonly known as the Tehuana cactus, is a species native to the Mexican state of Oaxaca. It is a columnar cactus characterized by its smooth, green stems and sparse, white spines. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking visual contrast to its otherwise muted appearance. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils. Due to its unique features, it is both ecologically significant and a symbol of the region's biodiversity."
