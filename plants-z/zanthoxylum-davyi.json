It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 4 to 8 inches long and composed of 5 to 9 ovate leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by bright red, berry-like fruits that are an important food source for wildlife. Its bark is rugged and fissured, and it often has thorns along its stems and branches. Zanthoxylum davyi is valued in horticulture for its ornamental qualities and ecological benefits."
