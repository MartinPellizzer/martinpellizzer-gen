    "intro": "Zoysia macrantha subsp. walshii, commonly known as the coastal zoysia, is a grass species native to coastal regions of Asia and Australia. It is characterized by its fine, dense foliage and ability to thrive in sandy, well-drained soils. The plant forms a dense turf that is highly tolerant of salt spray and coastal conditions. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and stabilize dune environments. It is often used in coastal landscaping for erosion control and aesthetic value."
