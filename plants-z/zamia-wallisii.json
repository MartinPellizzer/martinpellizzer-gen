It is a slow-growing, evergreen plant that features a short, stout trunk and a crown of stiff, feather-like leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. Zamia wallisii is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical significance in botanical studies."
