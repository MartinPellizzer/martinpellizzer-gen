    "intro": "Zinnia discolor, commonly known as the sunset zinnia, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its vibrant, velvety petals that range in color from white to deep red, depending on the variety and stage of bloom. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet and features a bushy, upright growth habit. Its flowers are borne on long, slender stems and are often used in floral arrangements due to their striking appearance. Zinnia discolor is a popular choice for gardens because of its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
