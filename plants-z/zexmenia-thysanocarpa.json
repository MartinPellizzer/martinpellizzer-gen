    "intro": "Zexmenia thysanocarpa, commonly known as the velvet fruit, is a rare and unique plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, velvety, purple-hued fruits that are covered in soft, hairy structures. The plant belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is known for its showy, five-petaled flowers. Its leaves are typically large, heart-shaped, and have a rough texture. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Zexmenia thysanocarpa is considered an endangered species."
