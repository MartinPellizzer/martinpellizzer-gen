    "intro": "Zanthoxylum schinifolium var. subinermis, commonly known as the Chinese prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically pinnate with 5 to 9 pairs of elliptical leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. Its bark and roots have been used in traditional medicine for their stimulant and analgesic properties. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas."
