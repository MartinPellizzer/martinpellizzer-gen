    "intro": "Zerna tomentella subsp. woronowii, commonly known as the woolly zerna, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features a compact rosette of broad, hairy leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine white pubescence. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in loose inflorescences and bloom in late spring to early summer. The subspecies is distinguished by its more robust growth and increased pubescence compared to the typical form of Zerna tomentella."
