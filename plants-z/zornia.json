These plants are typically annual or perennial herbs, characterized by their simple, alternate leaves and small, clustered flowers. Zornia species often have hairy stems and produce pods that contain small, lens-shaped seeds. They are native to various regions in the Americas and are sometimes found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. The genus includes around 30 species, many of which are adapted to dry or arid environments."
