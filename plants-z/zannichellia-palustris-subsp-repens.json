    "intro": "Zannichellia palustris subsp. repens, commonly known as the creeping water starwort, is a aquatic plant native to temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its submerged, ribbon-like leaves that are typically dark green and have a smooth, waxy surface. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are borne on slender, branching stems, often floating at the water's surface. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds, ditches, and wet meadows. Zannichellia palustris subsp. repens is often found in muddy or sandy substrates and is an important component of aquatic ecosystems."
