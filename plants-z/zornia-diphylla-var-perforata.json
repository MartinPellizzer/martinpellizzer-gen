    "intro": "Zornia diphylla var. perforata, commonly known as the perforate zornia, is a flowering plant species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant has palmate leaves with lobes that often have perforations, giving it its common name. Its small, pinkish-white flowers are clustered in dense, terminal spikes, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Zornia diphylla var. perforata is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils and its tolerance to arid conditions."
