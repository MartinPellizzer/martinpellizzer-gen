    "intro": "Zeravschania membranacea, commonly known as the Pamir bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving at high altitudes. Its leaves are often hairy and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Zeravschania membranacea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
