    "intro": "Zea vittata, commonly known as the golden grass or yellow beardgrass, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, yellowish flowers. Zea vittata is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in temperate climates. Its rapid growth and hardy nature make it a common weed in agricultural settings."
