    "intro": "Zehneria perrieri var. tsaratananensis, commonly known as the Tsaratanana zehneria, is a rare and endemic plant species native to Madagascar. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that are typically red or orange in color. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in montane rainforests. Its leaves are usually glossy and elliptical, with a prominent midrib. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
