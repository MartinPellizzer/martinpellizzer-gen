    "intro": "Zygophyllum sieversianum, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of central and southern Africa. It is characterized by its low, sprawling growth habit and small, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers, which are typically clustered in dense inflorescences, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its roots are deep and extensive, allowing it to access groundwater in dry soils. Zygophyllum sieversianum is well adapted to extreme temperatures and is often found in sandy or rocky habitats."
