    "intro": "Zanthoxylum goldmanii, commonly known as the golden prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Rutaceae family, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces red, berry-like fruits that are edible for wildlife but contain seeds that are dispersed by animals. Its bark and leaves have been used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties. The plant's botanical features make it an important component of its native ecosystem."
