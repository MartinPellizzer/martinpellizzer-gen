    "intro": "Zygophyllum divaricatum, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant features small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the dry season. Its leaves are usually small, linear, and covered in a waxy layer to reduce water loss. Zygophyllum divaricatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
