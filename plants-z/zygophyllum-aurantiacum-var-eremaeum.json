    "intro": "Zygophyllum aurantiacum var. eremaeum, commonly known as the red sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing shrub with fleshy, succulent stems and leaves that are adapted to conserve water. The plant produces clusters of small, bright orange to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is extensive and deep, allowing it to access groundwater in dry environments. Zygophyllum aurantiacum var. eremaeum is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in poor soils."
