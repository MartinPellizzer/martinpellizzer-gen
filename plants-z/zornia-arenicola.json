    "intro": "Zornia arenicola, commonly known as sand zornia, is a low-growing annual herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It thrives in sandy soils and is often found in desert scrub and rocky habitats. The plant has small, trifoliate leaves and produces clusters of pink to reddish-purple flowers. It is adapted to withstand drought conditions through its deep root system and reduced leaf surface. Zornia arenicola plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native environment."
