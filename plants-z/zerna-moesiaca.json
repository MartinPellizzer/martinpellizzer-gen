    "intro": "Zerna moesiaca, commonly known as the Moesian millet, is a small grain plant native to southern Europe. It belongs to the grass family, Poaceae, and is characterized by its compact, erect growth habit. The plant produces small, oval grains that are typically harvested when dry and mature. Zerna moesiaca is adapted to dry, temperate climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Its historical significance lies in its use as a traditional food source in parts of Eastern Europe."
