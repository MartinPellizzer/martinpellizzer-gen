    "intro": "Zanthoxylum occidentale, commonly known as the western prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 3 to 5 inches long and have serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that give way to red, fleshy berries in the fall. Its bark and twigs contain compounds that have been used in traditional medicine for their stimulant and analgesic properties. Zanthoxylum occidentale thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
