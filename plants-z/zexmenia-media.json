    "intro": "Zexmenia media, commonly known as the broadleaf zexmenia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It features broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, arranged in clusters at the base of the leaves. Zexmenia media thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and potential ecological role in its native habitats."
