    "intro": "Zalitea, commonly known as the silverleaf plant, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It features striking silver-gray foliage that helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which further aids in moisture retention. Zalitea is often cultivated for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
