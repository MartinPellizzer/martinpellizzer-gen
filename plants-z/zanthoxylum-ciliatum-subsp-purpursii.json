    "intro": "Zanthoxylum ciliatum subsp. purpursii, commonly known as the purple-fruited prickly ash, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves with serrated margins and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces bright red, fleshy fruits that are edible for certain wildlife species. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and stream banks. Its botanical features make it an important component of native ecosystems and a subject of interest in horticultural studies."
