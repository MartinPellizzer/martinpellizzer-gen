    "intro": "Zephyranthes pallida, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States and parts of Mexico. It is a member of the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant typically grows in wetlands and marshy areas, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soil. It has strap-like leaves that are often submerged in water, and its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the surrounding environment. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Zephyranthes pallida is considered a vulnerable species."
