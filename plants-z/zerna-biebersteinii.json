    "intro": "Zerna biebersteinii, commonly known as the Tibetan sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the high altitudes of the Tibetan Plateau. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, scale-like leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in its arid environment. It produces tiny, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in the summer months. Zerna biebersteinii is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited to harsh, cold climates."
