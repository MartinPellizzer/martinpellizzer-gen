It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, blade-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typical of the grass family. Zerna triniana is often found in open grasslands and along riverbanks, thriving in well-drained soils. Its growth habit makes it a useful plant for erosion control and livestock forage."
