    "intro": "Zanthoxylum stuhlmannii, commonly known as the Stuhlmann's prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are usually pinnate and have a serrated margin. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by bright red berries that are edible for some bird species. Zanthoxylum stuhlmannii is often found in humid lowland forests and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role. Its bark and leaves have been used in traditional medicine for their purported therapeutic properties."
