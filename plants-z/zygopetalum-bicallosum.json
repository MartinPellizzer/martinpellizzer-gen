    "intro": "Zygopetalum bicallosum, commonly known as the two-lobed zygopetalum, is a rare orchid species native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white, often with a contrasting lip. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, preferring well-drained, organic-rich soil. Its foliage consists of broad, leathery leaves that help it conserve moisture in its natural habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts."
