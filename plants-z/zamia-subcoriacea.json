    "intro": "Zamia subcoriacea, commonly known as the rough-leaved cycad, is a species of cycad native to Mexico. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and its large, pinnately compound leaves that are covered in a rough, scaly texture. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in well-drained soil. Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant."
