    "intro": "Zoysia planifolia, commonly known as the flatleaf zoysia, is a perennial grass species native to Asia. It is characterized by its dense, fine-textured foliage and slow growth rate, making it suitable for low-maintenance lawns. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers and has a rhizomatous root system that helps it spread and form thick mats. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soils. Zoysia planifolia is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its aesthetic appeal and durability."
