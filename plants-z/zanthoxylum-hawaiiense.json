    "intro": "Zanthoxylum hawaiiense, commonly known as the Hawaiian prickly ash, is a shrub native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its spiny stems and small, yellowish-green leaves. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for native birds. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in coastal areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
