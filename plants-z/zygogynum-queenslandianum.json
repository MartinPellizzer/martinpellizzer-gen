    "intro": "Zygogynum queenslandianum, commonly known as the Queensland water lily, is a semi-aquatic plant native to the wetlands of northern Australia. It features broad, floating leaves that are usually green with a waxy surface, allowing them to remain buoyant on water. The plant produces showy, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in the early morning and close by midday. Its roots are anchored in the muddy substrate, while its stems extend into the water. Zygogynum queenslandianum plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
