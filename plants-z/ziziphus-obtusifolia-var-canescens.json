    "intro": "Ziziphus obtusifolia var. canescens, commonly known as the woolly ziziphus, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its grayish-brown, hairy stems and oval, leathery leaves that are typically covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into edible, red to brown fruits resembling small dates. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in poor soils, making it well adapted to harsh environmental conditions. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and potential use in traditional medicine."
