It is characterized by its small, spiny leaves and clusters of yellowish-green flowers that appear in the spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodland edges and thickets. Its botanical features make it a notable species in the Rhamnaceae family."
