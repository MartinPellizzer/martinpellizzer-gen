    "intro": "Zygophyllum maximiliani, commonly known as the desert gypsum plant, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its fleshy, succulent leaves and showy yellow or orange flowers. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, saline environments, often growing on rocky or gypsum soils. Its small, clustered flowers bloom in late spring or early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Zygophyllum maximiliani plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
