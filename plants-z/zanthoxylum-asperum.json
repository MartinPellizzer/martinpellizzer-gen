It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 3 to 5 inches long and have serrated margins. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into red, fleshy berries in the fall. Its bark is thick and fissured, often with a distinctive, aromatic scent. Zanthoxylum asperum is valued in traditional medicine for its potential therapeutic properties."
