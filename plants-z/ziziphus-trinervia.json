    "intro": "Ziziphus trinervia, commonly known as the desert date or Indian date tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and South Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically trifoliate, consisting of three leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by edible, fleshy fruits resembling dates. Ziziphus trinervia is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots that allow it to thrive in poor soil and high temperatures. It is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of food in regions where water is scarce."
