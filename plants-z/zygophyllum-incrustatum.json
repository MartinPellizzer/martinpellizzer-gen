    "intro": "Zygophyllum incrustatum, commonly known as the sandmat, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its compact, mat-like growth form and small, waxy, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has small, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert scrub habitats. Zygophyllum incrustatum is well adapted to survive in extreme conditions with minimal water availability."
