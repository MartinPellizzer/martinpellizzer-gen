    "intro": "Zexmenia microcephala, commonly known as the small-headed zexmenia, is a rare and enigmatic plant species belonging to the family Zexmeniaceae. It is characterized by its diminutive, spherical fruit bodies that are typically less than 1 cm in diameter. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions with high rainfall. Its spore-producing structures are embedded within the fruit, making it unique among its relatives. Due to its limited distribution and fragile habitat, Zexmenia microcephala is considered a species of conservation concern."
