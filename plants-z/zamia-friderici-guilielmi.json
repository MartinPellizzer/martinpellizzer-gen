    "intro": "Zamia friderici-guilielmi, commonly known as the Guilielmi zamiaca, is a cycad-like plant native to the tropical regions of Central America. It belongs to the Zamiaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and feather-like, compound leaves. The plant produces large, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and requires partial to full sunlight. Due to its ornamental value and slow growth, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
