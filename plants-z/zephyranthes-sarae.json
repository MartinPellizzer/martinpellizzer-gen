    "intro": "Zephyranthes sarae, commonly known as Sara's rain lily, is a species of flowering plant native to the Caribbean, particularly Jamaica. It is a member of the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that bloom after rainfall. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in shaded to partially sunny conditions. Its bulbs are underground storage organs that allow it to survive dry periods and regenerate after rain. Zephyranthes sarae is often cultivated for its ornamental value and its ability to bloom in response to seasonal changes."
