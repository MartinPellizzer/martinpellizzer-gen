    "intro": "Zieria verrucosa, commonly known as the rough zieria, is a small, evergreen shrub native to the south-western region of Western Australia. It typically grows in heathlands and open forests, often on well-drained sandy soils. The plant features narrow, leathery leaves that are covered in fine, raised dots, giving them a rough texture. It produces small, white to pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Zieria verrucosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in native gardens due to its hardy nature and attractive foliage."
