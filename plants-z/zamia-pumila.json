    "intro": "Zamia pumila, commonly known as the little cycad, is a member of the Zamiaceae family and is native to the southeastern United States. It is a small, slow-growing plant with a stout, underground stem and a rosette of stiff, dark green, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cone-like structures, with male and female cones on separate plants, which are pollinated by insects. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Zamia pumila is notable for its unique appearance and its role in the ecological diversity of its native habitat."
