    "intro": "Zamia vestita, commonly known as the velvet cycad, is a member of the Zamiaceae family and is native to Mexico. It is a slow-growing, evergreen plant characterized by its stout, trunk-like stem and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones on separate plants. Its leaves are often covered in a velvety, waxy texture, giving it its common name. Zamia vestita is adapted to tropical and subtropical climates and requires well-drained soil and partial shade for optimal growth."
