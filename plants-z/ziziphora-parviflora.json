    "intro": "Ziziphora parviflora, commonly known as small-flowered ziziphora, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region and parts of Central Asia. It typically grows in rocky or dry soils, often in mountainous areas, and is characterized by its aromatic, gray-green foliage. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers clustered in dense spikes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a strong, mint-like scent, contributing to its use in traditional herbal medicine. Ziziphora parviflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
