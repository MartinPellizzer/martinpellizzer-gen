It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant features dark green, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, grayish pubescence. Its showy, composite flower heads bloom in late summer, producing purple to pink disc flowers surrounded by white to pink ray florets.
