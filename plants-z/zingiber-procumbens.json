    "intro": "Zingiber procumbens, commonly known as the dwarf ginger or creeping ginger, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Southeast Asia. It features a rhizomatous root system that spreads horizontally, allowing it to form dense mats. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in spike-like inflorescences, which are typically borne on short pedicels. Its leaves are lance-shaped, with a slightly hairy surface, and can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. Zingiber procumbens is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has some traditional medicinal uses in its native regions."
