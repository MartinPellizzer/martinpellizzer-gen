    "intro": "Zanthoxylum nemorale, commonly known as the mountain prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are opposite and have serrated margins. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for some wildlife. Zanthoxylum nemorale is often found in moist, wooded areas and is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological benefits. Its bark and leaves have been used in traditional herbal remedies for their purported medicinal properties."
