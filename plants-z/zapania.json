    "intro": "Zapania, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Fabaceae. It consists of several species, primarily found in tropical and subtropical regions of Asia and Africa. The plants are characterized by their woody stems and compound leaves, often with a distinctive reddish hue. Zapania species are valued for their hard, durable wood, which has been traditionally used in construction and furniture. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, many species are now threatened with extinction."
