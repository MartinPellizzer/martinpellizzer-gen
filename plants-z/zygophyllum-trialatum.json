    "intro": "Zygophyllum trialatum, commonly known as the desert morning glory, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia. It is a low-growing shrub that thrives in hot, dry environments, often found in sandy or rocky soils. The plant produces small, showy flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming in the early morning. Its leaves are usually small and fleshy, adapted to conserve water. Zygophyllum trialatum is well-suited to harsh climates and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
