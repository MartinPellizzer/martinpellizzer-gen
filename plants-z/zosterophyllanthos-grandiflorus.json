It belongs to the order Zosterophyllophyta, which includes some of the earliest known land plants. The plant exhibits a complex structure with a central axis and branching leaves, resembling early vascular plant morphology. Its leaves are typically broad and strap-like, with a waxy surface that aids in water retention. This species is often found in moist, shaded environments, where it plays a role in early ecological succession."
