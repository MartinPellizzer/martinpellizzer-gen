    "intro": "Zygosepalum angustilabium, commonly known as the narrow-lipped zygosepalum, is a member of the Orchidaceae family. It is a small, terrestrial orchid characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and delicate, pendulous inflorescences. The plant produces intricate flowers with a distinctive labellum that is narrower than the other sepals, giving it its specific epithet. It is native to Australia, particularly in the arid and semi-arid regions of Western Australia. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often considered a protected species in its native range."
