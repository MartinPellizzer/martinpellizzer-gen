    "intro": "Zephyranthes tenuiflora, commonly known as the rain lily, is a striking bulbous plant native to the southern United States and parts of Central America. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces delicate, white or pink flowers that bloom in response to rainfall. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its bulbs are adapted to store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. Zephyranthes tenuiflora is also valued for its ability to naturalize and create a carpet of blooms after rain."
