It typically grows in shallow freshwater wetlands, ponds, and slow-moving streams. The plant has long, narrow leaves that float on the water surface, with roots submerged in the mud. Its flowers are small, greenish-yellow spikelets that develop in summer, contributing to its role in wetland ecosystems. This subspecies is important for waterfowl habitat and helps in stabilizing aquatic soils."
