    "intro": "Zieria compacta var. glabrata, commonly known as the smooth zieria, is a low-growing shrub native to the eastern coast of Australia. It typically features small, rounded leaves that are smooth and glabrous, giving it its varietal name. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal areas. Due to its compact form and ornamental flowers, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and native plant collections."
