    "intro": "Zinnia maritima var. palmeri, commonly known as the coastal zinnia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows in coastal areas, thriving in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces vibrant yellow to orange flowers that bloom from summer to fall. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Zinnia maritima var. palmeri is well adapted to salt spray and high sunlight conditions, making it a resilient species in coastal ecosystems."
