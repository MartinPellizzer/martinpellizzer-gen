It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its striking, often colorful flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its flowers are zygomorphic, meaning they are bilaterally symmetrical, with a distinct lip or petal. Zygopetalum burtii thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth."
