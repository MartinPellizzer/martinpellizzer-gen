    "intro": "Zigadenus volcanicus, commonly known as the volcanic deathcup, is a striking perennial plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems and clusters of bell-shaped, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, toxic berries that are highly poisonous to both humans and animals. Its foliage consists of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. Zigadenus volcanicus thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to the harsh, cold conditions of its alpine habitat."
