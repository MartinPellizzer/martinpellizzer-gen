    "intro": "Zephyranthes andina, commonly known as the Andean rain lily, is a bulbous plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It produces striking white or pink flowers that bloom in response to rainfall, often during the rainy season. The plant has a short, narrow stem and linear leaves that are adapted to thrive in high-altitude, cool climates. Its bulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in dry periods. Zephyranthes andina is appreciated for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and partial shade."
