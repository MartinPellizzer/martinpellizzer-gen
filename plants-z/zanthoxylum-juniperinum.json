    "intro": "Zanthoxylum juniperinum, commonly known as the prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It belongs to the Rutaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves with serrated edges and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. Its bark and berries contain compounds used in traditional medicine for their purported antiseptic and analgesic properties. Zanthoxylum juniperinum thrives in moist, wooded areas and is often found in the understory of forests."
