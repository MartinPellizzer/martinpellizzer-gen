    "intro": "Zea mays var. striata, commonly known as the striped corn or variegated corn, is a variant of maize characterized by its distinctive striped leaves. This plant belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is native to the Americas. The variegation in its foliage is due to a mutation affecting chlorophyll distribution, resulting in alternating green and white or yellow stripes. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance. While it shares the basic structure of other corn species, its aesthetic traits make it popular in gardens and botanical collections."
