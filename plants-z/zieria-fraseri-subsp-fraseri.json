    "intro": "Zieria fraseri subsp. fraseri, commonly known as the Fraser's zieria, is a small evergreen shrub native to southeastern Australia. It typically grows in heathlands and sandstone-derived soils, thriving in well-drained, acidic conditions. The plant features narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. Its small, fragrant white flowers appear in spring, and it produces small, dark blue berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological importance in native plant communities."
