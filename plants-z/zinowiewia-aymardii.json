    "intro": "Zinowiewia aymardii, commonly known as the Aymard's zinowiewia, is a rare and unique plant native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its intricate, fern-like foliage. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in high-altitude regions with well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
