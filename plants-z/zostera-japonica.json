    "intro": "Zostera japonica, commonly known as Japanese eelgrass, is a marine flowering plant belonging to the family Zosteraceae. It is characterized by its ribbon-like, grass-like leaves that are typically 10\u201330 cm long and arranged in a fan shape. This species thrives in shallow coastal waters, often forming dense underwater meadows that provide habitat for various marine organisms. Zostera japonica plays a crucial role in stabilizing sediments and improving water quality through its extensive root system. It is also an important food source for marine life, including sea turtles and certain fish species."
