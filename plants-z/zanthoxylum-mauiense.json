    "intro": "Zanthoxylum mauiense, commonly known as Maui prickly ash, is a shrub native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Rutaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces red, berry-like fruits that are edible but have a sharp, acidic taste. It thrives in dry, coastal habitats and is adapted to the unique climate of Hawaii. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
