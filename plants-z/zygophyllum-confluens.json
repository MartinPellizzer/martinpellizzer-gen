    "intro": "Zygophyllum confluens, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial shrub with succulent, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access moisture from underground water sources. Zygophyllum confluens is well adapted to harsh desert conditions and plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils."
