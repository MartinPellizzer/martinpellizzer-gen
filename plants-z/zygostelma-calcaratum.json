    "intro": "Zygostelma calcaratum, commonly known as the sandstone cactus, is a unique succulent native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It features a thick, ribbed stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in drought conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers during the warmer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its rugged appearance. Its roots are shallow and adapted to quickly absorb moisture after rare rainfalls. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its natural range."
