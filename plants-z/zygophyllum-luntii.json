    "intro": "Zygophyllum luntii, commonly known as the desert morning glory, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its succulent stems and small, fleshy leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the early morning, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access groundwater in dry soils. Zygophyllum luntii plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
