    "intro": "Zygopetalum peruvianum, commonly known as the Peruvian zygopetalum, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that come in shades of yellow, orange, and red. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in its high-altitude, arid environment. Its leaves are typically strap-like and arranged in a rosette pattern, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Zygopetalum peruvianum is prized in horticulture for its ornamental value and is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant."
