    "intro": "Ziziphus otanesii, commonly known as the Mexican date palm, is a species of flowering plant in the Rhamnaceae family. It is native to Mexico and parts of Central America, where it thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. The plant is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and compound leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. Its small, yellowish flowers give way to edible fruits that are somewhat similar to dates. Ziziphus otanesii is also valued for its ornamental qualities and ability to withstand drought conditions."
