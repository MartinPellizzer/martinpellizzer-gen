    "intro": "Zanthoxylum rufescens, commonly known as the red prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 4 to 8 inches long and consist of 9 to 15 pairs of oval, serrated leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for wildlife. Its bark and leaves contain compounds that have been used in traditional medicine for their astringent and analgesic properties. Zanthoxylum rufescens thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and stream banks."
