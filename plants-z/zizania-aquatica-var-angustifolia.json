    "intro": "Zizania aquatica var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf wild rice, is a perennial aquatic plant native to North America. It thrives in shallow freshwater environments such as marshes, lakes, and slow-moving rivers. The plant has long, narrow leaves that are typically 1\u20133 mm wide, giving it its distinguishing name. Its flowers are small, greenish-brown spikelets that develop into rice-like grains, which are edible and historically important to Indigenous communities. This species plays a vital role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
