    "intro": "Zamia spartea, commonly known as the Mexican cycad, is a member of the Zamiaceae family and is native to Mexico. It is a slow-growing, evergreen plant characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and a crown of large, pinnate leaves. The plant produces cone-like structures, with male and female cones on separate plants, typical of cycads. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers a warm, humid climate. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
