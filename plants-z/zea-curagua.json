    "intro": "Zea curagua, commonly known as the Curagua maize, is a wild relative of maize native to the tropical regions of South America. It is a member of the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its tall, robust stalks and large, narrow leaves. The plant produces panicles of small, two-lobed flowers, which are typically greenish or purplish in color. Zea curagua is known for its genetic diversity and is of interest to plant breeders for its potential to improve modern maize varieties. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges."
