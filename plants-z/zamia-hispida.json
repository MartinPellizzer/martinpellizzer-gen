    "intro": "Zamia hispida, commonly known as the rough cycad, is a tropical plant native to Central America. It belongs to the family Zamiaceae and is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. Its foliage is often covered in small, stiff spines, giving it a distinctive appearance. Zamia hispida is adapted to grow in well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, humid environments."
