    "intro": "Zamia lindleyi, commonly known as the Lindley's cycad, is a member of the Zamiaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of Mexico and Central America. It is a dioecious plant, meaning that male and female reproductive structures are found on separate individuals. The plant produces large, palm-like leaves that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. Its cones, which contain the reproductive organs, are either male or female and are often clustered at the base of the plant. Zamia lindleyi is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
