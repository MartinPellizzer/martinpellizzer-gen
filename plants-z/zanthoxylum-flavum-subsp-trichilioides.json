    "intro": "Zanthoxylum flavum subsp. trichilioides, commonly known as the yellow prickly ash, is a shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 5\u20139 pairs of ovate to elliptical leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in axillary inflorescences, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife. Its bark and leaves contain compounds such as lignans and alkaloids, which have been studied for potential medicinal properties. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas."
