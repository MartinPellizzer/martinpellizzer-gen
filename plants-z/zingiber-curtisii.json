    "intro": "Zingiber curtisii, commonly known as the yellow ginger, is a rhizomatous herb native to Southeast Asia. It produces striking yellow flowers that bloom in terminal inflorescences, often with a distinctive red or orange bract. The plant has lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are aromatic and used in traditional medicine. Its rhizome is similar to ginger in appearance but has a different flavor profile. Zingiber curtisii is valued for its ornamental appeal and potential medicinal properties."
