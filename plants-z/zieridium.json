It is native to southern Africa and is characterized by its showy yellow flowers and hairy leaves. The plants typically grow in arid or semi-arid environments, showcasing adaptations to drought conditions.

Their compact growth habit and vibrant blooms make them popular in rock gardens and xeriscaping."
