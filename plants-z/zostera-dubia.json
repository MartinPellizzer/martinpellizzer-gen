It belongs to the family Zosteraceae and is characterized by its ribbon-like leaves that form dense underwater meadows.

Zostera dubia plays a vital role in stabilizing sediments and providing habitat for various marine organisms. Its reproductive structures are adapted for water dispersal, enhancing its ability to colonize new areas."
