    "intro": "Zea mays subsp. parviglumis, commonly known as the teosinte, is a wild grass native to Mexico and Central America. It is a close relative of modern corn and has small, clustered ears with hard, inedible kernels. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters and has narrow, grass-like leaves. Its flowering structure consists of tassels and spikelets, which are characteristic of the grass family. Zea mays subsp. parviglumis plays a significant role in the domestication history of maize."
