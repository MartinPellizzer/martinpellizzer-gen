    "intro": "Zeia glauca, commonly known as the blue mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, blue-gray flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, powdery blue waxy coating, which gives the plant its common name. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Zeia glauca is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
