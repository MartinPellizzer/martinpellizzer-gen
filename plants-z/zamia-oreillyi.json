    "intro": "Zamia oreillyi, commonly known as the Orellana cycad, is a member of the Zamiaceae family and is native to Central and South America. It is a dioecious plant, meaning it has separate male and female plants, and it produces cones rather than flowers. The plant has a short trunk with a crown of pinnately compound leaves that are typically dark green and leathery. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often in shaded, moist environments. Zamia oreillyi is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
