    "intro": "Zanthoxylum horridum, commonly known as the prickly ash or wild chinchona, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often covered in fine, stiff hairs, and its clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces red, fleshy fruits that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife. Its bark and leaves have been used in traditional medicine for their purported antiseptic and analgesic properties. Zanthoxylum horridum is also notable for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its role in supporting local ecosystems."
