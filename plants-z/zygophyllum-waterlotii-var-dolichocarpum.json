    "intro": "Zygophyllum waterlotii var. dolichocarpum, commonly known as the long-seeded jointvetch, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, sprawling habit and small, clustered leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, followed by elongated, bean-like pods that contain several seeds. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with limited water availability. Its botanical features make it an important component of desert ecosystems and a subject of study in plant ecology and conservation."
