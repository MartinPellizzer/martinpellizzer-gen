    "intro": "Zeuxine rupicola, commonly known as the rock zeuxine, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, showy flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or subalpine environments. Its leaves are simple and alternate, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Zeuxine rupicola is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and full sun."
