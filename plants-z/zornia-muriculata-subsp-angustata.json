    "intro": "Zornia muriculata subsp. angustata, commonly known as narrowleaf zornia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing annual herb with slender, hairy stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces pink to reddish-purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and pointed, with a rough texture due to the presence of stiff hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields."
