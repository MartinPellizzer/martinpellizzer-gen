    "intro": "Zemisia thomasii, commonly known as Thomas's zemisia, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, daisy-like flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Zemisia thomasii has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces pale yellow to orange flowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
