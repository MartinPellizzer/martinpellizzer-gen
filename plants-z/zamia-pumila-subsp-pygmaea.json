    "intro": "Zamia pumila subsp. pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf cycad, is a compact, evergreen plant native to the southeastern United States. It features a short, stout trunk with a crown of feathery, pinnate leaves that give it a distinctive, ancient appearance. The plant produces small, cone-like structures called strobili, which contain the reproductive organs. Its leaves are arranged in a rosette pattern, and the plant is adapted to thrive in moist, acidic soils. Zamia pumila subsp. pygmaea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
