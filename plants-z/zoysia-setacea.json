    "intro": "Zoysia setacea, commonly known as the velvetgrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its fine, dense foliage and a distinctive silver-gray appearance due to the presence of short, stiff hairs on its leaves. The plant forms a dense sod, making it an excellent choice for lawns and erosion control in warm climates. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires moderate water, though it is relatively drought-tolerant once established. Zoysia setacea is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to withstand foot traffic."
