    "intro": "Zea mays var. atropurpurea, commonly known as purple corn, is a variant of maize characterized by its striking purple pigmentation. This coloration arises from high concentrations of anthocyanin pigments in the kernels, which give the plant a distinct appearance. It is native to the Americas and has been cultivated for centuries by indigenous peoples for both culinary and medicinal purposes. The plant typically grows as an annual grass with tall, sturdy stalks and large, broad leaves. Its botanical features make it not only visually appealing but also nutritionally significant."
