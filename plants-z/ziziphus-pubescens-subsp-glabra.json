It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and small, often thorned branches. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically clustered, followed by edible, red or orange berries. It is adapted to drought conditions and has deep roots that allow it to thrive in poor soil. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has traditional uses in local cultures."
