    "intro": "Zanthoxylum catesbianum, commonly known as the common prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 4 to 6 inches long and consist of 5 to 9 pairs of opposite, ovate leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by bright red, berry-like fruits that are an important food source for wildlife. Its bark and leaves contain compounds that have been used in traditional medicine for their purported analgesic and antiseptic properties. Zanthoxylum catesbianum thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
