    "intro": "Zephyranthes amoena, commonly known as the pink rain lily, is a species of flowering plant in the Amaryllidaceae family. It is native to the southeastern United States, particularly Florida, and thrives in wetland and marsh environments. The plant produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in response to rainfall. Its bulbs are adapted to survive in wet conditions, and the leaves are grass-like, growing from a central rhizome. Zephyranthes amoena is often found in areas with seasonal flooding, making it a characteristic plant of the wetlands."
