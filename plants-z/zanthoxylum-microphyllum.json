    "intro": "Zanthoxylum microphyllum, commonly known as the dwarf prickly ash, is a small evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets that are often covered in fine, rusty-colored hairs. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are followed by bright red berries that are edible for some wildlife but considered toxic to humans. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swampy or wetland habitats. Zanthoxylum microphyllum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local biodiversity."
