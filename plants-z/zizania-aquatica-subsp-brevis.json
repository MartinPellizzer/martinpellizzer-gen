    "intro": "Zizania aquatica subsp. brevis, commonly known as narrowleaf watergrass, is a perennial aquatic plant native to North America. It typically grows in shallow freshwater environments such as marshes, ponds, and slow-moving streams. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often less than 2 millimeters wide, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are arranged in a loose, cylindrical cluster, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. This subspecies plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various aquatic and wetland organisms."
