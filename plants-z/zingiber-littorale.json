    "intro": "Zingiber littorale, commonly known as the coastal ginger, is a tropical plant native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is a rhizomatous herb that typically grows in sandy or muddy soils near the shoreline. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in spike-like clusters. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. Zingiber littorale is adapted to salt spray and tidal influences, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
