    "intro": "Zygophyllum altaicum, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is a low-growing shrub with distinctive yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant has small, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in its harsh environment. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in steppe and desert ecosystems. Zygophyllum altaicum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small desert animals."
