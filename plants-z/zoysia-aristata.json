    "intro": "Zoysia aristata, commonly known as the silvergrass or silver bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage and compact growth habit, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in late spring to early summer, followed by distinctive, fluffy seed heads. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established. Zoysia aristata is also valued for its ability to form dense mats, which help suppress weeds and prevent soil erosion."
