    "intro": "Zamia cremnophila, commonly known as the Mexican cycad, is a member of the Zamiaceae family and is native to Mexico. It is a dioecious plant, meaning it has separate male and female plants, and it produces cones instead of flowers. The plant has a stout, unbranched stem that is often covered in a thick, fibrous sheath. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with long, narrow leaflets that are arranged in a fan-like pattern. Zamia cremnophila is adapted to arid and rocky environments, making it a hardy, slow-growing plant."
