    "intro": "Ziziphus spina-christi var. microphylla, commonly known as the little leaf date palm, is a small, deciduous shrub or tree native to the Middle East and parts of southern Europe. It is characterized by its small, ovate leaves that are typically less than 2 cm in length, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by edible, sweet fruits that are similar to dates. It thrives in arid and semi-arid climates, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical significance in traditional medicine and agriculture."
