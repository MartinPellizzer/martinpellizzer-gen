    "intro": "Zingiber phumiangense, commonly known as the Phumiang ginger, is a rare and lesser-known member of the Zingiberaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Thailand, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces striking, ornamental flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, with a distinctive, fragrant aroma. Its rhizomes, while not as commercially valuable as those of common ginger, are used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Zingiber phumiangense is considered a vulnerable species."
