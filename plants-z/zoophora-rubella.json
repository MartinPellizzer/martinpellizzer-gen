    "intro": "Zoophora rubella, commonly known as the red velvet orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking deep red petals and velvety texture, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often near the forest floor in tropical rainforests. Its flowers bloom in clusters and are pollinated primarily by specific species of bees and wasps. Zoophora rubella is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological role in supporting local pollinator populations."
