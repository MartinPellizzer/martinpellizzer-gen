    "intro": "Zornia linearis, commonly known as the slender zornia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing annual herb with slender, branching stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Zornia linearis is adapted to arid environments and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Its botanical characteristics make it a common weed in dry, open habitats."
