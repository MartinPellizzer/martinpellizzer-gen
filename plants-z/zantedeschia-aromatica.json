    "intro": "Zantedeschia aromatica, commonly known as the sweet-scented calla lily, is a herbaceous perennial native to southern Africa. It features striking, arrow-shaped leaves and dramatic, white or pale yellow spatulate flowers with a prominent, often curled tepal. The plant is noted for its aromatic fragrance, particularly noticeable in the evening. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for water gardens and shaded borders. Zantedeschia aromatica is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for its elegant, almost theatrical blooms."
