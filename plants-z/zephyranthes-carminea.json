    "intro": "Zephyranthes carminea, commonly known as the pink rain lily, is a striking bulbous plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and its showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. The plant is adapted to thrive in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its flowers are ephemeral, often appearing after rainfall, and it is known for its ability to reseed itself naturally. Zephyranthes carminea is also valued for its low maintenance requirements and ornamental appeal."
