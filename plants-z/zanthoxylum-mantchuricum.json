    "intro": "Zanthoxylum mantchuricum, commonly known as the Manchurian prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically opposite and have serrated margins. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by bright red berries that are edible for some bird species. Zanthoxylum mantchuricum is often found in forest edges, stream banks, and disturbed sites due to its adaptability. Its woody structure and thorny branches make it a distinctive and hardy plant in its native habitat."
