    "intro": "Zanthoxylum australe, commonly known as the Australian prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically opposite and have serrated margins. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. Zanthoxylum australe thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in coastal and dry woodland habitats. Its ornamental value and ecological importance make it a notable species in Australian botany."
