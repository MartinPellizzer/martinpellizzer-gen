    "intro": "Zea mays, commonly known as corn, is a tall annual grass native to the Americas. It is characterized by its tall stalks, which can reach heights of up to 5 meters, and its tassel-like male flowers at the top. The female flowers develop into ears of corn, each covered in rows of kernels. The plant is a C4 plant, meaning it efficiently fixes carbon dioxide, making it well-suited for hot and dry climates. Zea mays is a staple crop globally, valued for its nutritional content and versatility in food and industrial uses."
