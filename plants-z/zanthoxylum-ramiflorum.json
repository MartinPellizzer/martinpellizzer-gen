It belongs to the Rutaceae family, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its compound leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces red, fleshy berries that are edible for some wildlife but contain seeds that can be dispersed by animals. Its bark and leaves have been used traditionally in herbal medicine for their stimulant and antiseptic properties."
