    "intro": "Zapoteca formosa subsp. rosei, commonly known as the rose-flowered zapoteca, is a shrub native to the highlands of Oaxaca, Mexico. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive pink to rose-colored flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface, and its stems are often covered in fine, white pubescence. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species in the wild."
