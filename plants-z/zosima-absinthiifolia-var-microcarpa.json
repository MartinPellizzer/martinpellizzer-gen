    "intro": "Zosima absinthiifolia var. microcarpa, commonly known as the small-fruited zosima, is a shrub native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its narrow, aromatic leaves that resemble those of absinthium, giving it its species name. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by tiny, oval-shaped fruits. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists."
