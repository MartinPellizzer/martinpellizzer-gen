    "intro": "Zamia disodon, commonly known as the Mexican cycad, is a member of the Zamiaceae family and is native to Mexico. It is a gymnosperm with a distinctive appearance, featuring a tall, unbranched stem and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often in shaded, well-drained soils. Due to its unique morphology and ecological significance, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
