    "intro": "Zosterophyllanthos cassidata, commonly known as the golden star fern, is a rare and unique plant belonging to the family Zosterophyllaceae. It is characterized by its striking, star-like inflorescences that resemble small, clustered flowers, though it is not a true flowering plant. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in tropical or subtropical regions. Its leaves are usually narrow and elongated, with a distinct, waxy texture that helps it retain moisture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Zosterophyllanthos cassidata is considered a conservation concern in many areas."
