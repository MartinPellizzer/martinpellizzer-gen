    "intro": "Zanthoxylum tachirense, commonly known as the Tachira prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are usually alternate and pinnate, with small, ovate leaflets. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by small, red berries that are edible for some wildlife. Its bark and leaves contain alkaloids and are used in traditional medicine for their stimulant and antiseptic properties. Zanthoxylum tachirense thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in cloud forests and mountainous areas."
