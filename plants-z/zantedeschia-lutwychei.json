    "intro": "Zantedeschia lutwychei, commonly known as the Lutwyche arum, is a striking plant native to southern Africa. It features large, heart-shaped leaves that are often a deep green with a glossy texture. The plant produces a striking spathe, which is a modified leaf that encloses the spadix, a cluster of small flowers. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas. The spathe can vary in color, ranging from white to pale yellow, depending on the specific variety."
