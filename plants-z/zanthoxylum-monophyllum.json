    "intro": "Zanthoxylum monophyllum, commonly known as the single-leaf prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which typically consist of a single leaflet, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for some wildlife. Zanthoxylum monophyllum is often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and stream banks. Its prickly stems and unique foliage make it a distinctive plant in its native habitat."
