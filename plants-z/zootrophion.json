    "intro": "Zootrophion, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has no leaves, relying instead on its roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. Its pale greenish-white flowers bloom in late summer, often in shaded, humid environments. Due to its specific habitat requirements, Zootrophion is considered critically endangered and is protected in many regions."
