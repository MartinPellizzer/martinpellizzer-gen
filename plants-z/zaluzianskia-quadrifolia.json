    "intro": "Zaluzianskia quadrifolia, commonly known as the four-leaf clover, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the bindweed family (Convolvulaceae) and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, wooded areas and thrives in partial shade. Its leaves are often mistaken for the lucky four-leaf clover, though it is not the same species. Zaluzianskia quadrifolia is a perennial herb that spreads through rhizomes and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
