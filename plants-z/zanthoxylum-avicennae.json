It is a shrub that typically grows in saline or sandy soils, adapting well to harsh coastal environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences, which are often mistaken for true flowers. Its leaves are compound, with multiple small leaflets that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticulture for its ability to thrive in challenging conditions."
