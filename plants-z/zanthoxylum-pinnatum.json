    "intro": "Zanthoxylum pinnatum, commonly known as the featherleaf prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and have a feathery appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for some wildlife. Its bark and leaves contain compounds that have been used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. The plant is well adapted to moist, acidic soils and thrives in partial to full shade."
