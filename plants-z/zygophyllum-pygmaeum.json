    "intro": "Zygophyllum pygmaeum, commonly known as the dwarf sandmat, is a low-growing shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It belongs to the family Zygophyllaceae and is characterized by its small, fleshy leaves and yellow flowers. The plant is well adapted to harsh environments, with deep roots that help it survive in sandy soils. Its flowering period typically occurs in the spring, and it plays a role in stabilizing desert soils. Zygophyllum pygmaeum is also of interest for its potential in phytoremediation due to its ability to tolerate saline conditions."
