    "intro": "Zeuxine gengmanensis, commonly known as the Gengman's zeuxine, is a flowering plant species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Pontederiaceae and is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its humid environment. Zeuxine gengmanensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in local ecosystems by supporting pollinators and providing habitat for small organisms."
