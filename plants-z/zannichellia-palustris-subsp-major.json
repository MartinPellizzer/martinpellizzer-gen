It typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds, lakes, and wetlands. The plant has slender, branching stems that are often submerged, with small, translucent, arrowhead-shaped leaves. Its flowers are unisexual, with male and female flowers on separate plants, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits.
