    "intro": "Zwingera humifusa, commonly known as the ground-leaf zwingera, is a rare and delicate herbaceous plant native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its small, clustered leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, textured appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, which bloom in late spring or early summer. Zwingera humifusa thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along streambanks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
