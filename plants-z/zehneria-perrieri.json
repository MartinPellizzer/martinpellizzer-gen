    "intro": "Zehneria perrieri, commonly known as the Perrier's zehneria, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Madagascar. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat, and features waxy, lance-shaped leaves. Zehneria perrieri is known for its pale yellow to white flowers, which bloom in spring and are often fragrant. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native environment."
