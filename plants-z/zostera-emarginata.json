It is characterized by its ribbon-like, grass-like blades that grow in dense underwater meadows, typically in shallow coastal waters. This plant plays a vital role in stabilizing sediments and providing habitat for various marine organisms. It thrives in brackish to saltwater environments and is often found in estuaries and tidal flats. Zostera emarginata is also important for carbon sequestration and supports biodiversity in coastal ecosystems."
