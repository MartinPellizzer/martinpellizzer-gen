    "intro": "Zexmenia arnottii f. genuina, commonly known as the Australian sandalwood, is a rare and endemic plant species found in the arid regions of Western Australia. It belongs to the family Myrtaceae and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit with small, aromatic leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its foliage is adapted to withstand harsh, dry conditions, with thick, waxy leaves that reduce water loss. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
