    "intro": "Ziziphora cleonioides, commonly known as desert lavender, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its aromatic, gray-green foliage and clusters of small, purple-pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well adapted to harsh desert environments. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their aromatic properties, and the plant plays a role in supporting local pollinators. Ziziphora cleonioides is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological resilience in xeriscaped landscapes."
