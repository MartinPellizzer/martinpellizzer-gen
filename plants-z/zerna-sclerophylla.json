    "intro": "Zerna sclerophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved wattle, is a shrub native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves that are typically grey-green in color, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in spherical inflorescences. It is adapted to grow in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal and inland regions. Zerna sclerophylla is a hardy, drought-tolerant species that plays an important role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
