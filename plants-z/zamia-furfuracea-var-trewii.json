    "intro": "Zamia furfuracea var. trewii, commonly known as the Mexican cycad, is a unique species belonging to the Zamiaceae family. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of stiff, dark green, strap-like leaves. The plant produces large, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. It is native to southern Mexico and is adapted to grow in tropical and subtropical climates. Due to its slow growth and specific environmental requirements, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in botanical gardens and private collections."
