    "intro": "Zerna monoclada, commonly known as the flat-seeded grass, is a low-growing annual plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender,\u4e1b\u751f stems and narrow leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically arranged in dense clusters at the base of the plant. Zerna monoclada is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, where it thrives in full sun. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas quickly."
