    "intro": "Zanthoxylum fraxinifolium, commonly known as the yellow buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 4 to 10 inches long and have serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for birds and mammals. Its bark is thick and fissured, and it contains alkaloids that have been used in traditional medicine. Zanthoxylum fraxinifolium thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed areas."
