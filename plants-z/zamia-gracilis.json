    "intro": "Zamia gracilis, commonly known as the slender cycad, is a tropical plant native to Central America. It is a member of the Zamiaceae family and is characterized by its tall, unbranched stem and large, feather-like leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate to high light exposure. Zamia gracilis is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
