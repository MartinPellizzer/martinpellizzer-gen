    "intro": "Ziziphus borneensis, commonly known as the Bornean date palm, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Borneo. It belongs to the Rhamnaceae family and is characterized by its palm-like appearance with a tall, slender trunk and pinnate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by edible drupes that resemble dates in texture and flavor. Ziziphus borneensis is adapted to grow in moist, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Its botanical features make it an important species for both ecological and potential economic value in its native habitat."
