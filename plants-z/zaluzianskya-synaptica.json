It belongs to the Aizoaceae family, known for its succulent characteristics and ability to store water in its leaves. The plant features fleshy, silver-green leaves that are covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. It produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Zaluzianskya synaptica is well adapted to arid environments and thrives in well-drained soil with minimal water."
