    "intro": "Zygia, commonly known as the golden bell, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or small trees native to tropical and subtropical regions. The plants are characterized by their showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. Zygia species often have opposite, simple leaves and produce small, fleshy fruits. They are valued in horticulture for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
