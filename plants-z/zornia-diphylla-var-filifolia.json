    "intro": "Zornia diphylla var. filifolia, commonly known as the threadleaf zornia, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features small, opposite leaves that are often thread-like in appearance, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry, rocky habitats. Zornia diphylla var. filifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting native pollinators."
