    "intro": "Zexmenia arnottii f. densifolia, commonly known as the dense-leaved zexmenia, is a compact shrub native to the coastal regions of southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage that provides a thick canopy, which helps it thrive in saline and sandy soils. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers during late winter to early spring, adding ornamental value. Its growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes where it can tolerate salt spray and wind. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
