    "intro": "Zanthoxylum alpinum, commonly known as the alpine prickly ash, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its small, yellowish-green flowers and red, berry-like fruits that mature in the autumn. The plant has compound leaves with serrated edges and small, spiny fruits that are often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Zanthoxylum alpinum plays a role in supporting local wildlife, particularly birds that consume its berries."
