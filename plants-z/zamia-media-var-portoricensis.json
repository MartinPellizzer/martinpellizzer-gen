    "intro": "Zamia media var. portoricensis, commonly known as the Puerto Rican zamia, is a cycad-like plant native to the Caribbean island of Puerto Rico. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and large, compound leaves that are spirally arranged. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in its native range."
