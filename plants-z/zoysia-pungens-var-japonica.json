    "intro": "Zoysia pungens var. japonica, commonly known as Japanese lawngrass, is a warm-season grass native to East Asia. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically light to medium green in color. This variety is known for its dense growth habit and ability to form a fine, uniform turf. It thrives in full sun and is drought-tolerant once established. The plant has a rhizomatous growth system, allowing it to spread and fill in bare spots effectively."
