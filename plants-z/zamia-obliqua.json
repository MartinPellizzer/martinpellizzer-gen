    "intro": "Zamia obliqua, commonly known as the Mexican palm or zigzag cycad, is a unique member of the Zamiaceae family. It is native to southern Mexico and is characterized by its distinctive, palm-like appearance with long, narrow, leathery leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. Its cycad-like structure and slow growth rate make it a popular choice for collectors and botanical gardens. Zamia obliqua is also notable for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its tolerance to drought conditions."
