    "intro": "Zosima humilis, commonly known as the low zosima, is a small, herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central and South America. It typically grows to a height of less than 30 centimeters, with slender stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are usually borne on short pedicels. Zosima humilis is adapted to survive in harsh environments, exhibiting drought tolerance and the ability to store water in its succulent leaves. Its botanical features make it a distinctive member of the Amaranthaceae family."
