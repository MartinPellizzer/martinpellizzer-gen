It is a small tree or shrub that typically grows to a height of 3 to 5 meters. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by edible, sweet, and fleshy fruits resembling dates. Its leaves are pinnate, with long, narrow leaflets that are often covered in fine hairs. Ziziphus mistol is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy species suitable for dry climates."
