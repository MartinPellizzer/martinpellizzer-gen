    "intro": "Zeuktophyllum suppositum, commonly known as the false sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It typically forms dense mats of small, fleshy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers during the short growing season. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which reduces water loss and aids in survival in cold, dry conditions. Zeuktophyllum suppositum is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats."
