    "intro": "Zanthoxylum sonorense, commonly known as the Sonoran prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub native to the Sonoran Desert region of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically made up of several pairs of ovate to elliptic leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by bright red berries that are edible for some wildlife species. Zanthoxylum sonorense thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and along desert washes. Its hardy nature and ability to withstand drought make it an important component of the local desert ecosystem."
