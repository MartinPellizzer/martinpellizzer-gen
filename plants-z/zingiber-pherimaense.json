    "intro": "Zingiber pherimaense, commonly known as the Pherima ginger, is a rare and lesser-known species of the Zingiberaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly found in the mountainous areas of Myanmar. The plant produces striking, elongated inflorescences with vibrant orange and yellow flowers, which bloom during the rainy season. Its rhizomes are similar to those of other gingers but are less commonly used in culinary or medicinal applications. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
