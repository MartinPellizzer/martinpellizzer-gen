    "intro": "Zoysia seslerioides, commonly known as the silvergrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern China. It is characterized by its fine, silver-blue foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in dense clumps and forms a low, compact turf. It is well adapted to dry and sunny conditions, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to thrive in poor soils and its resistance to drought."
