    "intro": "Zosima rubtzovii, commonly known as the Siberian bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the cold climates of Siberia and the Far East. It features slender, upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped flowers, typically in shades of blue or violet. The plant has small, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, fuzzy layer, aiding in moisture retention in its harsh environment. Zosima rubtzovii is adapted to grow in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or tundra regions. Its blooming period occurs in late summer, adding a splash of color to the otherwise stark landscape."
