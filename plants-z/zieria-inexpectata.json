    "intro": "Zieria inexpectata, commonly known as the unexpected zieria, is a small shrub native to the coastal regions of southeastern Australia. It typically grows in heathlands and sand dunes, where it thrives in well-drained, acidic soils. The plant features narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, white or pale yellow flowers during the spring. Zieria inexpectata is noted for its compact growth habit and is often used in native gardens for its ornamental value. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
