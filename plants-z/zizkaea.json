    "intro": "Zizkaea, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance with pale, almost translucent flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them, relying instead on air, rain, and debris for sustenance. Its leaves are typically narrow and strap-like, and it lacks a traditional root system, instead having aerial roots that absorb moisture and nutrients. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Zizkaea is considered a conservation concern in many regions."
