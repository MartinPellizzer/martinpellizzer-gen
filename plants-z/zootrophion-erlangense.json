    "intro": "Zootrophion erlangense, commonly known as the Erlang Mountain orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its delicate, slender stems and small, intricately patterned flowers that typically bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments with well-drained soil, often found in rocky or forested areas. Its root system is specialized for nutrient absorption, adapting to the nutrient-poor soils of its habitat. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Zootrophion erlangense is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
