    "intro": "Zamia madida, commonly known as the Madida cycad, is a species native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Zamiaceae and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnate leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Due to its slow growth and conservation status, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
