    "intro": "Zephyranthes minima subsp. hexandra, commonly known as the pink rain lily, is a small, herbaceous perennial plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often appearing after rainfall. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is adapted to thrive in well-drained, sandy soils. It is typically found in open, sunny habitats such as prairies and woodland edges. Due to its low-growing habit and ornamental flowers, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and naturalized landscapes."
