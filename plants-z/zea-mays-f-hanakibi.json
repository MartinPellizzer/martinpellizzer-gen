    "intro": "Zea mays f. hanakibi, commonly known as the Japanese cornflower, is a decorative variant of maize characterized by its vibrant, showy inflorescence. It features a tall, slender stalk with narrow, grass-like leaves and a dense cluster of small, colorful flowers that range from blue to purple. The plant is native to Japan and is cultivated primarily for its ornamental value rather than for grain production. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, often blooming in late summer. This cultivar is popular in gardens for its striking appearance and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
