    "intro": "Zanthoxylum acanthopodium var. timbor, commonly known as the Timbor prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Rutaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves with serrated margins and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife species. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and stream banks. Its ornamental value is limited due to its thorny structure, but it plays a role in local ecosystems."
