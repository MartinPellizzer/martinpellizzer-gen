It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and hairy leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear both male and female flowers. Zea hirta is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in a variety of environmental conditions. It is considered an important plant in ecological studies due to its role in supporting pollinators and its potential for agricultural use."
