It thrives in shallow, brackish waters and is often found in estuaries and tidal flats. The plant has long, ribbon-like leaves that grow in dense underwater beds, providing habitat for various marine organisms. It plays a crucial role in stabilizing sediments and improving water quality. Zostera latifolia is also an important food source for marine animals such as sea turtles and waterfowl."
