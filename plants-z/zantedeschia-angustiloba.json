    "intro": "Zantedeschia angustiloba, commonly known as the narrow-leaved calla, is a herbaceous perennial native to southern Africa. It features striking, arrow-shaped leaves that are typically narrower than those of other calla lily species. The plant produces showy, white spathes that enclose bright yellow spadices, creating a dramatic floral display. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Zantedeschia angustiloba is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a cut flower."
