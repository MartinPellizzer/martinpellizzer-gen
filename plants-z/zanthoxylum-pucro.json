    "intro": "Zanthoxylum pucro, commonly known as the prickly ash or American prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It belongs to the Rutaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often divided into 5 to 9 narrow, pointed leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by bright red berries that are edible for some wildlife but considered toxic to humans. Zanthoxylum pucro is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used traditionally in herbal medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
