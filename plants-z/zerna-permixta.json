    "intro": "Zerna permixta, commonly known as the mixed millet, is a small annual grass native to temperate regions of Asia. It produces small, oval-shaped grains that are typically harvested when dry and mature. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and grows in clusters, often in disturbed soils or along roadsides. It is valued for its hardiness and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. Zerna permixta is primarily cultivated for its seeds, which are used as a food source in traditional cuisines."
