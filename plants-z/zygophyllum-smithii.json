    "intro": "Zygophyllum smithii, commonly known as Smith's prickly scalebush, is a low-growing shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States. It belongs to the family Zygophyllaceae, which is characterized by its succulent leaves and showy, often yellow or red flowers. The plant has small, spiny leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its flowers are typically clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences, and they bloom in late spring or early summer. Zygophyllum smithii is well adapted to drought conditions and is often found in rocky soils and desert landscapes."
