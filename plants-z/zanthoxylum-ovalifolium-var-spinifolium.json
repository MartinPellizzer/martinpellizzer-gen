    "intro": "Zanthoxylum ovalifolium var. spinifolium, commonly known as the spiny-leaf prickly ash, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves with oval-shaped leaflets and spiny margins, which contribute to its defensive adaptations. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and streamside habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and natural landscapes."
