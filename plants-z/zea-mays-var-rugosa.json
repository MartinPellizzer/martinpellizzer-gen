    "intro": "Zea mays var. rugosa, commonly known as the hairy maize or rugose corn, is a variant of maize characterized by its rough, textured cob. This plant belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is native to the Americas, particularly Central and South America. Its unique appearance is due to the presence of fine, hair-like structures on the cob, which distinguish it from other maize varieties. It is primarily cultivated for ornamental purposes rather than for grain production. The plant typically grows to a height of 1.5 to 2 meters and produces ears with a distinctive, rugged surface."
