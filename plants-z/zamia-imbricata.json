    "intro": "Zamia imbricata, commonly known as the Mexican cycad, is a member of the Zamiaceae family and is native to Mexico. It is a slow-growing plant with a stout, woody trunk and a crown of pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants. Its leaves are often used in traditional crafts, and it is valued for its ornamental appearance. Zamia imbricata is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
