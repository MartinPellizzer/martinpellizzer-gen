    "intro": "Zanthoxylum affine, commonly known as the prickly ash or yellow sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often arranged in pairs and have serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are a source of food for birds and small mammals. Zanthoxylum affine is typically found in moist, shady areas such as woodlands and streambanks. Its bark and leaves have been used in traditional medicine for their purported therapeutic properties."
