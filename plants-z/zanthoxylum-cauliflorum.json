    "intro": "Zanthoxylum cauliflorum, commonly known as the mountain prickly ash, is a member of the Rutaceae family and is native to the southeastern United States. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows in moist, wooded areas. The plant is characterized by its smooth, reddish bark and pinnately compound leaves with serrated edges. Its flowers are small and yellowish-green, arranged in clusters, and it produces bright red, fleshy berries that are edible for some wildlife. The plant has a woody structure with thorny branches, which contribute to its defensive adaptations in its natural habitat."
