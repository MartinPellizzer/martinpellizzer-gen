    "intro": "Zanthoxylum molle, commonly known as the Mexican prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are opposite and pinnately arranged, with serrated margins. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by red, fleshy berries. Its bark and roots contain compounds used in traditional medicine for their analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties. Zanthoxylum molle thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in chaparral and woodland habitats."
