    "intro": "Zygophyllum simplex var. herniarioides, commonly known as the narrowleaf desert raisin, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, fleshy, yellowish-green leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is well adapted to harsh desert conditions, with a deep root system that allows it to access groundwater. This species is often found in gravelly soils and is an important component of desert ecosystems."
