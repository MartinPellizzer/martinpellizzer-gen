It features compound leaves with serrated edges and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces red, berry-like fruits that are edible for some wildlife but considered toxic to humans. Its bark and leaves contain compounds used in traditional medicine for their stimulant and analgesic properties. The hairy pubescens variety is distinguished by its dense, soft hairs covering the stems and leaves."
