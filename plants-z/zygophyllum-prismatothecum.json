    "intro": "Zygophyllum prismatothecum, commonly known as the sandmat, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Zygophyllaceae. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia. The plant is characterized by its low-growing, sprawling habit and small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss in harsh environments. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, arranged in clusters, and are adapted to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Zygophyllum prismatothecum is well-suited to sandy soils and can thrive in conditions of extreme drought."
