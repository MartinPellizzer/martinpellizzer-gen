    "intro": "Zygopetalum binotii, commonly known as the two-banded orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the high-altitude regions of Ecuador. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, showy flowers with distinct color patterns. The plant has a pseudobulb structure, which helps it store water and nutrients in its native arid environment. Its flowers typically bloom in spring and are known for their intricate, fragrant petals. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Zygopetalum binotii is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs."
