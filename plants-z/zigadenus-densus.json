    "intro": "Zigadenus densus, commonly known as death cup, is a toxic plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Melanthiaceae and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces a cluster of small, cup-like fruits that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Due to its high toxicity, it should never be handled or ingested."
