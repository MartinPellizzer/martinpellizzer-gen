    "intro": "Zornia prostrata var. macrantha, commonly known as the large-flowered zornia, is a low-growing annual herb native to the southeastern United States. It features prostrate or spreading stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, with showy, tubular corollas that are typically larger than those of the typical variety. Its leaves are simple, ovate to lanceolate, and covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields."
