It is native to parts of Central and South America, where it typically grows in moist, shaded environments. The plant features small, lance-shaped leaves that are usually less than 2 inches in length. Its flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant, and it produces small, fleshy fruits. Zygia brevifolia is often found in understory habitats of tropical forests, contributing to the biodiversity of these ecosystems."
