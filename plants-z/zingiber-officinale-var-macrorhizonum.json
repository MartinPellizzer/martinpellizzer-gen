It is native to Southeast Asia and thrives in tropical climates with high humidity and well-drained soil. The plant produces tall, leafy stalks that bear clusters of fragrant, pale yellow flowers. Its rhizomes are used in traditional medicine and cooking, similar to common ginger, but with a more intense flavor. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and culinary potential."
