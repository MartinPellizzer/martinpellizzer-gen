    "intro": "Zygophyllum fabagineum, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It is a low-growing shrub with woody stems and small, fleshy leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces yellow or white flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access deep water sources in dry soils. Zygophyllum fabagineum plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and supporting desert ecosystems."
