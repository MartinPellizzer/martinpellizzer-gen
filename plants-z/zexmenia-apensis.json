    "intro": "Zexmenia apensis, commonly known as the Apennine zexmenia, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and small, clustered white flowers. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or forested habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Zexmenia apensis is considered a vulnerable species. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study."
