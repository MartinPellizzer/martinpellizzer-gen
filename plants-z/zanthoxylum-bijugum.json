    "intro": "Zanthoxylum bijugum, commonly known as the two-winged prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are opposite and have a serrated margin. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for some wildlife. Its bark is rough and often has a distinctive, aromatic scent. Zanthoxylum bijugum is valued for its ornamental qualities and its role in supporting local ecosystems."
