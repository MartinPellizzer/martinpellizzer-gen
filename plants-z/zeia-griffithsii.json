    "intro": "Zeia griffithsii, commonly known as the Griffiths' zeia, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of eastern India. It is a flowering plant belonging to the family Apiaceae, characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, clustered white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forested areas with rich, well-drained soil. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Zeia griffithsii is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and taxonomic studies."
