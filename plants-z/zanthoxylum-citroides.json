    "intro": "Zanthoxylum citroides, commonly known as the yellow prickly ash, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its yellowish-green to reddish-brown bark, which becomes fissured with age, and its compound leaves that are opposite and have serrated margins. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by bright red, fleshy fruits that are edible for some wildlife but toxic to humans. Zanthoxylum citroides is also valued for its aromatic properties and has been used in traditional herbal medicine for various purposes."
