    "intro": "Zygostates lunata var. subintegripetala, commonly known as the moonflower orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, white, night-blooming flowers that emit a sweet fragrance, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white pubescence, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its flowers are typically arranged in a raceme and can reach lengths of up to 15 centimeters. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a valuable and often endangered species in its native environment."
