    "intro": "Zoysia, commonly known as zoysia grass, is a warm-season grass species native to Asia and Australia. It is characterized by its fine texture, dense growth habit, and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. Zoysia has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically light to medium green in color. It is highly drought-tolerant and requires less frequent mowing compared to other turfgrasses. This plant is widely used in lawns, sports fields, and erosion control due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
