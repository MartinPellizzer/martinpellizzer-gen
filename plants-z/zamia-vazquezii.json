    "intro": "Zamia vazquezii, commonly known as the V\u00e1zquez cycad, is a rare and ancient plant native to the tropical regions of Mexico. It belongs to the family Zamiaceae and is characterized by its stout, woody trunk and a crown of feathery, pinnate leaves. The plant produces large, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of cycads. Zamia vazquezii is adapted to grow in shaded, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
