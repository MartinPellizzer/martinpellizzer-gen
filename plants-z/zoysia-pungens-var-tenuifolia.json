    "intro": "Zoysia pungens var. tenuifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf zoysia, is a low-growing, mat-forming grass native to eastern Asia. It features narrow, grass-like leaves with a fine texture and a bluish-green color that remains vibrant throughout the growing season. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by dark, spherical seed heads. It is highly drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it suitable for ornamental and low-maintenance landscapes. Its dense growth habit helps suppress weeds and provides erosion control in suitable environments."
