    "intro": "Zoysia japonica, commonly known as Japanese zoysia, is a warm-season grass native to East Asia. It is characterized by its fine, dense foliage and a mat-forming growth habit that creates a lush, carpet-like appearance. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue and produces small, pale blue flowers in the summer. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for lawns and landscaping in temperate climates. Zoysia japonica is also valued for its ability to recover quickly from damage and its low maintenance requirements."
