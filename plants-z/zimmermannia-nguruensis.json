    "intro": "Zimmermannia nguruensis, commonly known as the Nguru mountain lily, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Tanzania. It belongs to the family Iridaceae and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its flowers feature vivid colors, often in shades of blue and purple. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Zimmermannia nguruensis is considered a rare and endangered species."
