    "intro": "Zamia stevensonii, commonly known as the Stevenson's cycad, is a member of the Zamiaceae family and is native to Mexico. It is a slow-growing, dioecious plant with a stout, unbranched stem that remains underground for most of its life. The plant produces large, palm-like leaves that are spirally arranged and can reach up to 2 meters in length. Its reproductive structures include a male cone and a female cone, which produce pollen and seeds, respectively. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
