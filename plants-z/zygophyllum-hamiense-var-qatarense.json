    "intro": "Zygophyllum hamiense var. qatarense, commonly known as the Qatari sandmat, is a low-growing, perennial shrub native to arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa. It features small, fleshy, paddle-shaped leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its deep root system allows it to access groundwater, making it well adapted to desert conditions. Zygophyllum hamiense var. qatarense is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
