    "intro": "Zingiber wrayi var. wrayi, commonly known as the Wray's ginger, is a rare and distinctive member of the Zingiberaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly found in the mountainous areas of Thailand and Vietnam. The plant is characterized by its vibrant, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of fragrant, orchid-like flowers that bloom in shades of yellow and orange. Its rhizome, like other gingers, is often used in traditional medicine for its purported therapeutic properties. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
