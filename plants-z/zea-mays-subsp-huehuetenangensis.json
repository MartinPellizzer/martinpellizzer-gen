    "intro": "Zea mays subsp. huehuetenangensis, commonly known as the Mexican maize, is a subspecies of maize native to southern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, compact ears and is considered a wild relative of modern corn. This plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in warm, humid climates. Its botanical features include narrow leaves and a robust root system adapted to nutrient-poor soils. It plays a significant role in the genetic diversity of maize species and is of interest to researchers studying crop evolution."
