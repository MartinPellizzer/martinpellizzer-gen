It belongs to the Rutaceae family, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its compound leaves and clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces bright red berries that are edible, though they are often consumed by birds and other wildlife. Zanthoxylum aguilarii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
