    "intro": "Zephyranthes minuta, commonly known as the dwarf rain lily, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States and parts of Mexico. It produces delicate, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in response to rainfall, often appearing after summer storms. The plant has strap-like, grassy leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Zephyranthes minuta is also known for its short blooming period, which usually lasts only a few days."
