It is a low-growing perennial shrub that typically reaches a height of about 10\u201330 cm. The plant features small, fleshy leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Its flowers are yellow or orange and are clustered in dense inflorescences, often appearing in late spring to early summer. This species is well-suited to sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland dunes."
