    "intro": "Zeuxine alticola, commonly known as the alpine zeuxine, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, often blue or violet flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine meadows, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are simple and alternate, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. Zeuxine alticola is known for its short growing season and is often found in mountainous regions with limited soil depth."
