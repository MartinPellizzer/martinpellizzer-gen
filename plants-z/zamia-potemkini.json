    "intro": "Zamia potemkini, commonly known as the Potemkin cycad, is a member of the Zamiaceae family and is native to Mexico. It is a gymnosperm with a distinctive appearance, featuring a stout, unbranched stem and pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. Its leaves are thick and leathery, adapted to arid conditions, and it is often found in rocky or limestone soils. Zamia potemkini is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
