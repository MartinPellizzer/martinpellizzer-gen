    "intro": "Zoelleria procumbens, commonly known as the prostrate zoelleria, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, commonly known as the buckwheat family, and is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit. The plant features slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats of foliage. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and it produces small, clustered flowers in late summer. Zoelleria procumbens is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks."
