    "intro": "Zollernia ilicifolia var. clausseniana, commonly known as the Clausen's holly-leaf zollernia, is a rare shrub native to specific regions of Mexico. It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, clustered flowers. The leaves are typically leathery and have a holly-like appearance, giving the plant its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight, often found in rocky or limestone-rich habitats. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
