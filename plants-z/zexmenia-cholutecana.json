    "intro": "Zexmenia cholutecana, commonly known as the Choluteca zexmenia, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central America. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its distinctive blue-violet bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments within tropical forests, preferring well-drained, nutrient-rich soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a slightly hairy texture, while its stems are slender and somewhat woody. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Zexmenia cholutecana is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
