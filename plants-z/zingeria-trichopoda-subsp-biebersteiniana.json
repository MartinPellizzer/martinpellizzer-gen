    "intro": "Zingeria trichopoda subsp. biebersteiniana, commonly known as the Bieberstein's zingeria, is a rare and distinctive member of the Rubiaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, woody stems and small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It is native to specific regions in southern Africa, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a threatened species in its native range."
