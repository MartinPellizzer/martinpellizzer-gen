    "intro": "Zygopetalum triste, commonly known as the sad zygopetalum, is a rare and delicate orchid native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its pale pink to white flowers with a distinctive, elongated lip that sets it apart from other orchid species. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in rocky or forested areas. Its foliage consists of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Zygopetalum triste is considered a challenging plant to cultivate outside its natural range."
