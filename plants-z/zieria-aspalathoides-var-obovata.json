It features dense, compact foliage with narrow, obovate leaves that are typically covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in heathland and coastal scrub environments.
