    "intro": "Zamia corsoniana, commonly known as the Corson's cycad, is a member of the Zamiaceae family and is native to Mexico. It is a dioecious plant, meaning that male and female reproductive structures are found on separate individuals. The plant has a stout, unbranched trunk with a crown of stiff, sword-shaped leaves. Its cones, which are the reproductive structures, are typically borne on the trunk and can be either male or female. Zamia corsoniana is adapted to grow in tropical and subtropical climates, often in well-drained soils."
