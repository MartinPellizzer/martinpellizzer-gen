    "intro": "Zinnia anomala, commonly known as the desert zinnia, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous perennial that thrives in hot, dry climates and is well adapted to sandy or rocky soils. The plant produces vibrant, daisy-like flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, which bloom from summer to fall. Its foliage is typically narrow and linear, with a grayish-green hue that helps reduce water loss. Zinnia anomala is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping and wildflower gardens."
