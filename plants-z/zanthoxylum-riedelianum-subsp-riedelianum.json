    "intro": "Zanthoxylum riedelianum subsp. riedelianum, commonly known as the red prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Central America and parts of the Caribbean. It is characterized by its compound leaves with serrated edges and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces red berries that are edible for some animals but generally considered toxic to humans. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in moist, well-drained soils. Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and horticultural contexts."
