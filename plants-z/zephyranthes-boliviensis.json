    "intro": "Zephyranthes boliviensis, commonly known as the Bolivian rain lily, is a species of flowering plant native to South America, particularly Bolivia and neighboring regions. It is a bulbous perennial that produces striking white or pale pink flowers during the rainy season. The plant features strap-like, narrow leaves that are typically evergreen and succulent, adapted to store water. Its flowers are typically short-lived, opening in the evening and closing by morning, a characteristic known as nyctinasty. Zephyranthes boliviensis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in well-drained soil with adequate moisture."
