It is a member of the Lamiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs and shrubs. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is characterized by its square stems and opposite leaves. Its small, tubular flowers are usually pink or purple and bloom in the summer months. Ziziphora siliquosa produces small, dry fruits called silique, which are typical of the Brassicaceae family, though it is botanically classified within Lamiaceae."
