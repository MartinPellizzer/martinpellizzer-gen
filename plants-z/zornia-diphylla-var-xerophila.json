    "intro": "Zornia diphylla var. xerophila, commonly known as the desert zornia, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its low-growing, sprawling habit and small, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pink to reddish-purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fibrous root system allows it to thrive in poor, well-drained soils. Zornia diphylla var. xerophila is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures, making it a resilient species in harsh environments."
