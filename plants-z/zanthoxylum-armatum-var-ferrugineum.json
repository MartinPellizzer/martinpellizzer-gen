    "intro": "Zanthoxylum armatum var. ferrugineum, commonly known as the rusty prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves with serrated margins and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife. Its bark and twigs contain compounds that have been used in traditional medicine. The plant's thorny structure and distinctive foliage make it easily identifiable in its natural habitat."
