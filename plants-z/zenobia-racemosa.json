    "intro": "Zenobia racemosa, commonly known as the clustered zenobia, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, upright growth habit and produces clusters of small, pale yellow to greenish flowers. The plant has succulent leaves that are adapted to store water, making it drought-tolerant. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access moisture from lower soil layers. Zenobia racemosa is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
