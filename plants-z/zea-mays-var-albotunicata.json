    "intro": "Zea mays var. albotunicata, commonly known as the white-tunicated corn, is a variant of maize characterized by its distinctive white or pale tunic that covers the kernels. This tunic is a thin, papery layer that forms around the pericarp, giving the plant a unique appearance compared to typical maize varieties. The botanical features of this plant include its tall stalks, broad leaves, and the elongated, cylindrical ears that bear the white-tuniced kernels. It is primarily cultivated for its ornamental value due to its striking visual characteristics. This variety is also studied for its genetic traits and potential use in hybrid breeding programs."
