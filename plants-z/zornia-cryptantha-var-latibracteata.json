    "intro": "Zornia cryptantha var. latibracteata, commonly known as the broad-bract zornia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect, annual growth habit. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink to purple in color, and it has pinnately compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. The broad bracts that give it its name are part of its distinctive floral structure, contributing to its ecological role in supporting pollinators."
