    "intro": "Zornia crinita, commonly known as hairy zornia, is a herbaceous annual plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which are often covered in fine, soft pubescence. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. Zornia crinita thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in woodland edges and along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological studies and native plant gardening."
