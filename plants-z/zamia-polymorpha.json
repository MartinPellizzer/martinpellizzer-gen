    "intro": "Zamia polymorpha, commonly known as the cycad, is a gymnosperm native to the southeastern United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feather-like leaves. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones typically growing on separate plants. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with a distinctive zigzag pattern along the leaflets. Zamia polymorpha is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and slow growth rate."
