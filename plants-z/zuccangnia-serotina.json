It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant prefers well-drained, loamy soils and partial to full sunlight. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stem. Zuccangnia serotina is often found in woodland edges and open meadows, where it contributes to local biodiversity."
