    "intro": "Ziziphus wynadensis, commonly known as the Wynad date palm, is a flowering plant native to the Western Ghats of India. It is a small to medium-sized tree that typically grows up to 10 meters in height, featuring a straight trunk and dense, leathery leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by edible fruits that resemble dates in appearance. Ziziphus wynadensis is valued for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Its adaptability to dry and rocky soils makes it a resilient species in its native habitat."
