    "intro": "Zygopetalum silvanum, commonly known as the forest zygopetalum, is a rare and delicate orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It features a compact, upright growth habit with dark green, strap-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers with a unique zygomatic structure, characterized by a large, showy lip that is typically a deep purple or violet. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil to flourish. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in specialized botanical gardens and conservation programs."
