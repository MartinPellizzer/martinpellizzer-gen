    "intro": "Zephyranthes monantha, commonly known as the rain lily, is a species of flowering plant native to the wetlands of the southeastern United States and parts of Mexico. It is a herbaceous perennial that produces striking white or pale pink flowers that bloom in response to rainfall. The plant has strap-like, narrow leaves that are typically evergreen, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soil. Zephyranthes monantha is often found in marshy areas and can tolerate periodic flooding. Its flowers are short-lived but are succeeded by distinctive, helmet-shaped seed pods."
