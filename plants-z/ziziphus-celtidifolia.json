    "intro": "Ziziphus celtidifolia, commonly known as the European buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically grows to a height of 2\u20136 meters and has dark green, oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in spring, which are followed by dark blue berries in late summer. These berries are a food source for birds and mammals, and the plant is often used in hedgerows for its dense, thorny growth. It thrives in well-drained soils and is somewhat drought-tolerant once established."
