    "intro": "Zygotritonia hysterantha, commonly known as the yellow rain lily, is a strikingly beautiful flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant features strap-like, grassy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. Its flowers are typically borne on tall, erect stems and are known for their strong, sweet fragrance. Zygotritonia hysterantha is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in warm, humid environments."
