    "intro": "Zostera capensis, commonly known as the Cape eelgrass, is a marine flowering plant native to the coastal waters of South Africa. It thrives in shallow, sandy or muddy substrates and is typically found in intertidal zones. The plant has long, ribbon-like leaves that form dense underwater meadows, providing essential habitat for various marine species. Zostera capensis plays a crucial role in stabilizing sediments and improving water quality through its dense root system. It is also an important food source for marine herbivores such as sea urchins and certain fish species."
