    "intro": "Zosterophyllanthos scurrula, commonly known as the staghorn fern, is a unique epiphytic plant that thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its tree-like appearance, with a central trunk and branching fronds. The plant's fronds are typically leathery and can grow in a variety of shapes, often resembling antlers, hence its common name. Zosterophyllanthos scurrula prefers indirect light and high humidity, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Its ability to grow on other plants without parasitizing them makes it an interesting subject in botanical studies."
