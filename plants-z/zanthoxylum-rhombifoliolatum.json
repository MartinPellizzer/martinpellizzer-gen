It is characterized by its compound leaves with rhombic-shaped leaflets and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for birds and small mammals. It is often found in moist, wooded areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits. The bark and leaves have been used in traditional medicine for their purported medicinal properties."
