    "intro": "Zygophyllum glaucescens var. lobulatum, commonly known as the sandmat, is a low-growing shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It features small, fleshy, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access deep water sources and stabilize sandy soils. This species is well adapted to drought and is often used in rehabilitation of degraded landscapes."
