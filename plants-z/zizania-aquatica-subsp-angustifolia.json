It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, pale brown flowers that develop into cylindrical grains of rice. This subspecies typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as marshes and slow-moving streams. Its seeds are an important food source for waterfowl and other wildlife. The plant plays a significant ecological role in maintaining wetland ecosystems and is also valued for its historical and cultural significance to Indigenous communities."
