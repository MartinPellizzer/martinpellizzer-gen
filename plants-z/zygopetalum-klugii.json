It is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that typically display a mix of white, pink, and purple hues. The plant features a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are broad and elliptical, often with a waxy texture that helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat.
