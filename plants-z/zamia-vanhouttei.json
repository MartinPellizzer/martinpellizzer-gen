    "intro": "Zamia vanhouttei, commonly known as the Vanhoutte's cycad, is a member of the Zamiaceae family and is native to Mexico. It is a slow-growing, evergreen plant characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cone-like structures, with male and female cones on separate plants, typical of cycads. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate to high light exposure. Due to its ornamental value and conservation status, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections."
