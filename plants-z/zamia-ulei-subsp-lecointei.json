    "intro": "Zamia ulei subsp. lecointei, commonly known as the Lecointe's cycad, is a rare cycad species native to the humid forests of eastern Mexico. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and large, pinnately compound leaves that are typically dark green and leathery. The plant produces small, spherical cones that are usually yellowish-green in color, containing both male and female reproductive structures. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat destruction, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
