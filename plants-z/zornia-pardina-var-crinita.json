    "intro": "Zornia pardina var. crinita, commonly known as the hairy zornia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert or semi-arid environments. It produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals. Its hairy leaves and stems are adaptations to reduce water loss in arid conditions."
