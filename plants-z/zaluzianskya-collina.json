    "intro": "Zaluzianskya collina, commonly known as the sandverbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that thrives in well-drained sandy soils. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming in late summer to early autumn. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Zaluzianskya collina is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
