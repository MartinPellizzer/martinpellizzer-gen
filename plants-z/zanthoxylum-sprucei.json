    "intro": "Zanthoxylum sprucei, commonly known as the Sierra prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically composed of 5 to 9 pairs of ovate, serrated leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in axillary inflorescences, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for some wildlife. Zanthoxylum sprucei thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Its aromatic foliage and unique morphology make it a distinctive member of the Rhamnaceae family."
