    "intro": "Zinowiewia sulphurea, commonly known as the sulfur plant, is a rare and striking member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers, which resemble small, clustered umbels, and its distinctive sulfur-yellow coloration. Native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, this plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. Its leaves are finely divided and aromatic, often emitting a strong scent when crushed. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Zinowiewia sulphurea is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
