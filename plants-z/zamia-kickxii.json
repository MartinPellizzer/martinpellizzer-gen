    "intro": "Zamia kickxii, commonly known as the Kickx's cycad, is a species of cycad native to Mexico. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and its pinnately compound leaves that are spirally arranged. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight. Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
