    "intro": "Ziziphora suffruticosa, commonly known as sweetwood or shrubby ziziphora, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region and parts of southern Europe. It is characterized by its aromatic, often gray-green leaves and small, tubular flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its essential oils, derived from the leaves and flowers, are valued for their fragrance and medicinal properties. Ziziphora suffruticosa is also noted for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
