    "intro": "Zanthoxylum varians, commonly known as the variable prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Rutaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces red, fleshy berries that are edible for some wildlife but generally considered bitter by humans. Its bark and leaves contain compounds that have been used in traditional medicine for their potential analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties. Zanthoxylum varians thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and thickets."
