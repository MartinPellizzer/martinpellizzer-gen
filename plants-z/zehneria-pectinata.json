    "intro": "Zehneria pectinata, commonly known as the velvetleaf or silverleaf plant, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its broad, waxy leaves that often have a silvery or velvety appearance due to a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its flowers are small and clustered, usually in spikes, and can range in color from green to purple. Zehneria pectinata is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
