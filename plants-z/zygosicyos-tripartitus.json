    "intro": "Zygosicyos tripartitus, commonly known as the three-part bottle gourd, is a unique member of the Cucurbitaceae family. It is native to tropical Africa and is characterized by its distinctive, three-lobed stem and pale green, waxy leaves. The plant produces large, bottle-shaped fruits that can grow up to 2 meters in length. Its botanical features include a fibrous, spongy interior and a thick, ridged rind. Due to its unusual morphology, it is often cultivated for ornamental purposes as well as for its edible fruit."
