    "intro": "Zornia diphylla var. hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy zornia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive two-lobed leaves and clusters of small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its hairy foliage and stems are notable features that help reduce water loss in its native habitat. Zornia diphylla var. hirsuta is often found in open woodlands and along streambanks, where it contributes to local biodiversity."
