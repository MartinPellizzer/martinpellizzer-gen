    "intro": "Zamia cupatiensis, commonly known as the Mexican cycad, is a member of the Zamiaceae family and is native to Mexico. It is a perennial plant characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and a crown of large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants. Zamia cupatiensis is adapted to grow in tropical and subtropical climates, often in well-drained soils. Due to its slow growth and unique morphology, it is a popular specimen plant in botanical gardens and collections."
