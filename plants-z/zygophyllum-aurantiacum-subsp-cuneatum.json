    "intro": "Zygophyllum aurantiacum subsp. cuneatum, commonly known as the red sandmat, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It features small, fleshy, yellow or orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a robust root system that allows it to thrive in poor, sandy soils and withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are typically narrow and succulent, aiding in water retention. Zygophyllum aurantiacum subsp. cuneatum is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
