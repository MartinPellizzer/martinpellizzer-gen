    "intro": "Zornia stirlingii, commonly known as Stirling's zornia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. Its seeds are enclosed in pods that split open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind. Zornia stirlingii is often found in dry, disturbed soils and is adapted to arid environments."
