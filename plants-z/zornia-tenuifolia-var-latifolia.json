    "intro": "Zornia tenuifolia var. latifolia, commonly known as broadleaf zornia, is a herbaceous annual plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, trifoliate leaves. The plant produces clusters of pea-like flowers that are typically pink or violet in color, which bloom in early summer. Its root system is well-developed, allowing it to thrive in sandy or rocky soils, and it is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. The species is notable for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility in its native habitats."
