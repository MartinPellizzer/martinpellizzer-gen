    "intro": "Zamia angustissima, commonly known as the narrowleaf cycad, is a member of the Zamiaceae family and is native to Mexico. It is a dioecious plant, meaning it has separate male and female plants, and it produces cones rather than flowers. The plant has a short trunk and a rosette of stiff, narrow, evergreen leaves. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in limestone soils. Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is a popular ornamental plant in horticulture."
