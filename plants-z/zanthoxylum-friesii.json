    "intro": "Zanthoxylum friesii, commonly known as the Chinese prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often pinnate and have a distinctive, aromatic scent. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that give way to red, fleshy berries in the fall. Its bark and leaves contain compounds such as lignans and alkaloids, which have been studied for potential medicinal properties. Zanthoxylum friesii thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas across its native range."
