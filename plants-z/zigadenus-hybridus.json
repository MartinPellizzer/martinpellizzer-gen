    "intro": "Zigadenus hybridus, commonly known as the death camas, is a toxic plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Melanthiaceae and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, green berries that are highly poisonous. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care and is often avoided in landscaping."
