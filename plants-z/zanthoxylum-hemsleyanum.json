    "intro": "Zanthoxylum hemsleyanum, commonly known as the Hemsley's prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically pinnate with 5 to 9 pairs of leaflets, and its clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces red, fleshy berries that are edible for some bird species but generally unpalatable to humans. Zanthoxylum hemsleyanum is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens for its attractive form and seasonal interest. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable plant for dry, rocky landscapes."
