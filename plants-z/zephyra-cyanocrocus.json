    "intro": "Zephyra cyanocrocus, commonly known as the sky-blue bellflower, is a striking perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of the Mediterranean. It features slender, upright stems that bear clusters of delicate, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue and purple. The leaves are narrow and lanceolate, with a slightly hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its blooming period typically occurs in late spring to early summer, adding a vibrant splash of color to its natural habitat."
