    "intro": "Zanthoxylum marginatum, commonly known as the Mexican prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It belongs to the Rutaceae family, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its spiny stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for some animals but considered toxic to humans. Its bark and leaves have been used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties. The plant's botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and medicinal contexts."
