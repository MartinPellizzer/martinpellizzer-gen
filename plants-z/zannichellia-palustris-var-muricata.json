    "intro": "Zannichellia palustris var. muricata, commonly known as the prickly water plantain, is a submerged aquatic plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds, lakes, and ditches. The plant has long, ribbon-like leaves that are often ribbed and covered with small, sharp spines, giving it its common name. Its flowers are small and greenish-white, arranged in dense spikes, and it blooms from late spring to early autumn. This species plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
