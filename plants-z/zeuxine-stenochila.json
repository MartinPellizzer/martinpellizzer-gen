It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family, which includes buttercups and other related genera. The plant is characterized by its delicate, grass-like leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
