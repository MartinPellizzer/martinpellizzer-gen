    "intro": "Zollikoferia arabica var. squarrosa, commonly known as the squarrosa sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense, woolly layer of hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically borne on tall, slender stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is sometimes used in traditional medicine and as a ornamental plant."
