    "intro": "Zamia muricata var. picta, commonly known as the Painted Zamia, is a cycad species native to Mexico. It is characterized by its distinctive, palm-like leaves that are often variegated with green, white, and yellow patterns. The plant produces cone-like structures, with male and female cones on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. Its leaves are compound, with a rough, textured surface that gives it a unique appearance. The plant is slow-growing and has a long lifespan, making it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardens."
