    "intro": "Zanthoxylum bouetense, commonly known as the African prickly ash, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its spiny branches and small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by red or orange berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. Zanthoxylum bouetense thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in forest margins or secondary growth areas. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
