    "intro": "Zexmenia pseudosilphioides var. mollis, commonly known as the soft zexmenia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to specific regions of South America. It features delicate, fern-like leaves that are soft to the touch, as indicated by its varietal name \"mollis.\" The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
