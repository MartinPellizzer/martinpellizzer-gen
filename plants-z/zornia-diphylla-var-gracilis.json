    "intro": "Zornia diphylla var. gracilis, commonly known as slender zornia, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows in moist, open habitats such as prairies and woodland edges. The plant features alternate, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, pale blue or white flowers in clusters. Its botanical characteristics include a fibrous root system and a tendency to form dense stands in disturbed soils. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local insect populations."
