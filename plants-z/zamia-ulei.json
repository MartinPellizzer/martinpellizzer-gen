It is a slow-growing, evergreen plant that produces a stout, unbranched stem with a thick, fibrous trunk. The plant has large, pinnately compound leaves that are dark green and leathery in texture. It produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants. Zamia ulei is adapted to tropical and subtropical climates and requires well-drained soil and ample sunlight."
