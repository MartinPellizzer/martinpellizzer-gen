    "intro": "Zieria tenuis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved zieria, is a small, shrub-like plant native to the eastern coast of Australia. It belongs to the family Epacridaceae and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, narrow leaves. The plant produces white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn, attracting various pollinators. Zieria tenuis typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as heathlands and rainforests. Its foliage and floral structure are adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor soils, making it a unique component of its native ecosystem."
