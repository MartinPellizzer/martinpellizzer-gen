    "intro": "Zerna transsilvanica, commonly known as the Transylvanian millet, is a small annual grass species native to Central and Eastern Europe. It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and fields. It is valued for its hardy nature and historical use in traditional agriculture. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and threatened species in many regions."
