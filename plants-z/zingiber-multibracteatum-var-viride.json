    "intro": "Zingiber multibracteatum var. viride, commonly known as the green-bracted ginger, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically a vibrant green. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow to greenish flowers, which are borne on inflorescences that resemble those of true gingers. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties. This variety is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its potential medicinal uses."
