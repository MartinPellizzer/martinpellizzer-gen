    "intro": "Zauschneria glandulosa, commonly known as the stickyleaf sandverbena, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its glandular leaves that produce a sticky substance, which helps in reducing water loss and deterring herbivores. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in coastal or inland habitats. It produces showy, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Zauschneria glandulosa is a member of the Geraniaceae family and is often found in coastal scrub and chaparral ecosystems."
