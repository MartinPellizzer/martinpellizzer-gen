    "intro": "Zygopetalum brachypetalum var. pallidum, commonly known as the pale zygopetalum, is a hybrid orchid species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its pendulous, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features long, slender stems with numerous clustered flowers, each having three sepals and three petals, with the labellum being distinctly different and often more colorful. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is appreciated for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
