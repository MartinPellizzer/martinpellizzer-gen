It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its vibrant, showy flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, with narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of bright yellow to orange flowers. Zinnia mexicana is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Its natural habitat includes rocky soils and open areas, where it often blooms from summer to early fall."
