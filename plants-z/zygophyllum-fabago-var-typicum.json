    "intro": "Zygophyllum fabago var. typicum, commonly known as the desert morning glory, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its fleshy, succulent stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pale yellow to orange in color, blooming in the early morning. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low rainfall. Zygophyllum fabago var. typicum plays a role in stabilizing desert soils and providing forage for wildlife."
