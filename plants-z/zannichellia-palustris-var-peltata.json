    "intro": "Zannichellia palustris var. peltata, commonly known as the broad-leaved water starwort, is a aquatic plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves that are often peltate, meaning they have a central point from which the leaflets radiate. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds, ditches, and marshes. It produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in spikes, and it is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize sediments. Zannichellia palustris var. peltata is a valuable species for both ecological and ornamental purposes in aquatic habitats."
