    "intro": "Zoysia sinica, commonly known as Chinese zoysia, is a perennial grass native to East Asia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and fine, bluish-green foliage. The plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established. It produces small, pale green to brown flowers in late summer, and its rhizomes allow it to spread aggressively. Zoysia sinica is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its aesthetic appeal and hardiness."
