It is characterized by its ability to thrive in calcium-rich soils, making it a specialized plant adapted to specific environmental conditions. The plant features a short, stocky stem with spirally arranged leaves that are typically narrow and strap-like. Its foliage is often a deep green, with a waxy texture that helps reduce water loss.
