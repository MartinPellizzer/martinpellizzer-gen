    "intro": "Zanthoxylum schreberi, commonly known as the Brazilian prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often pinnate and have a serrated edge. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for birds and small mammals. Zanthoxylum schreberi is also valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported therapeutic properties. Its thorny branches and distinctive foliage make it a notable species in its native habitats."
