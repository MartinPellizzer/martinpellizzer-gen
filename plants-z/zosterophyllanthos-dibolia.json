    "intro": "Zosterophyllanthos dibolia, commonly known as the coastal ribbon plant, is a rare flowering plant native to the rocky shores of southern Africa. It is characterized by its long, ribbon-like leaves that are adapted to withstand strong coastal winds and salt spray. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is highly specialized, allowing it to anchor firmly in the sandy or rocky substrates of its habitat. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, Zosterophyllanthos dibolia is considered a vulnerable species."
