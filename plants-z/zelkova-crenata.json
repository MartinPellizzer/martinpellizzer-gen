    "intro": "Zelkova crenata, commonly known as the Japanese zelkova, is a deciduous tree native to East Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, lobed leaves that resemble those of the maple, with a smooth, dark green upper surface and a lighter, fuzzy underside. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by winged fruits that disperse its seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and shade-providing canopy. Zelkova crenata is also valued in horticulture for its resistance to urban pollution and its ability to adapt to various climate conditions."
