    "intro": "Zexmenia brevifolia, commonly known as the short-leaved zexmenia, is a rare and specialized plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually greenish-white in color, which bloom in clusters near the base of the stems. Zexmenia brevifolia thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in dense forest undergrowth where it competes for limited light. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
