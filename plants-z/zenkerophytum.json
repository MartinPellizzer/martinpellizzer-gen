    "intro": "Zenkerophytum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the orchid family and is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance with elongated leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its survival depends on specific environmental conditions, including high humidity and indirect light. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Zenkerophytum is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
