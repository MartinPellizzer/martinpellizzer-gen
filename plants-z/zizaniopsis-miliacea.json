    "intro": "Zizaniopsis miliacea, commonly known as paragrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Americas. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions. Due to its invasive nature, it is considered a weed in many regions where it has been introduced."
