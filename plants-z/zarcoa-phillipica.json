    "intro": "Zarcoa phillipica, commonly known as the Philippine star orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the Philippines. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its star-shaped blooms, which are typically white or pale blue in color. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in mountainous regions with rich, well-draining soil. Its flowers are short-lived but highly fragrant, attracting pollinators such as bees and moths. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Zarcoa phillipica is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs."
