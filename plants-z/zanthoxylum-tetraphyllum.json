    "intro": "Zanthoxylum tetraphyllum, commonly known as the four-leafed prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often divided into four pairs of leaflets, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for some wildlife. Its bark and leaves contain compounds that have been used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. Zanthoxylum tetraphyllum thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
