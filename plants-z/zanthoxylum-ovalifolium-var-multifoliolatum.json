    "intro": "Zanthoxylum ovalifolium var. multifoliolatum, commonly known as the many-leaved prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 5 to 9 pairs of ovate to elliptic leaflets, giving it a distinctive, feathery appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clustered inflorescences, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for some wildlife. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and riverbanks. Its ornamental value and ecological importance make it a notable species in native plant gardens."
