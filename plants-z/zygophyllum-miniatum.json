    "intro": "Zygophyllum miniatum, commonly known as the dwarf sandmat, is a low-growing shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its small, fleshy leaves and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to survive in nutrient-poor, sandy soils. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil in harsh environments. Zygophyllum miniatum plays a role in supporting local wildlife, including insects and small mammals."
