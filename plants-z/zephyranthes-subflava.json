    "intro": "Zephyranthes subflava, commonly known as the yellow rain lily, is a species of flowering plant native to the southeastern United States and parts of Mexico. It is a bulbous perennial that produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange. The plant typically blooms in the spring and early summer, often following periods of rain, which is reflected in its common name. Its foliage consists of strap-like leaves that are grass-like in appearance. Zephyranthes subflava is well adapted to wetland environments and is often found in marshy areas or near water sources."
