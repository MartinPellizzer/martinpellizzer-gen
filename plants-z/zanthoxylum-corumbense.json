    "intro": "Zanthoxylum corumbense, commonly known as the Brazilian prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically pinnate with serrated margins. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Zanthoxylum corumbense is often found in disturbed habitats, such as forest edges and clearings, and is adapted to a variety of soil types. Its thorny branches and aromatic foliage make it a distinctive and ecologically significant species in its native range."
