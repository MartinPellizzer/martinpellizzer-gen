    "intro": "Zephyranthes minima, commonly known as the dwarf rain lily, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the southern United States and parts of Central America. It typically grows to a height of only a few inches, with narrow, grass-like leaves and small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in response to rainfall. The plant is adapted to wetland environments and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity. Due to its delicate appearance and ephemeral blooming cycle, it is a popular subject for botanists and gardeners interested in native flora."
