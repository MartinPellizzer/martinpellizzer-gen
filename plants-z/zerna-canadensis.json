    "intro": "Zerna canadensis, commonly known as Canadian wild rye, is a perennial grass native to North America. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along riverbanks. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense stands, which can help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Canadian wild rye is also valued for its role in wetland restoration and as a forage plant for wildlife."
