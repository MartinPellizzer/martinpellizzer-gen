    "intro": "Zanthoxylum hamiltonianum var. tomentosum, commonly known as the woolly prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often covered in a dense, whitish pubescence, giving the plant its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into red, berry-like fruits in the fall. Its bark is thick, rough, and often peels in strips, and it is often used in traditional medicine. The species is valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
