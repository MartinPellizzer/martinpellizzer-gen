    "intro": "Zygophyllum zilloides, commonly known as the desert morning glory, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its small, fleshy leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of yellow to orange. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to survive in nutrient-poor, sandy soils. Its flowers open in the early morning and close by midday, adapting to the intense heat of the desert environment. Zygophyllum zilloides plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
