    "intro": "Zieria revoluta, commonly known as the hairy zieria, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southeastern Australia. It typically grows to a height of around 30 centimeters and features small, elliptical leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white flowers during the spring, which are followed by small, round berries. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal dunes. Zieria revoluta is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract native pollinators."
