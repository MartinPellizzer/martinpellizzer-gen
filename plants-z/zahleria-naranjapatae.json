    "intro": "Zahleria naranjapatae, commonly known as the orange-leaf zahleria, is a species of flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its showy, colorful flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in cloud forests, and has hairy leaves that help reduce water loss. Its vibrant orange and red flowers bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species, making conservation efforts essential for its survival."
