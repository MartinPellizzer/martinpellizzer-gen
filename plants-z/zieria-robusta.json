    "intro": "Zieria robusta, commonly known as the robust zieria, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southeastern Australia. It features dense, leathery leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and have a glossy, dark green appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers clustered in rounded inflorescences, which bloom in late winter to early spring. Zieria robusta is well adapted to sandy or rocky soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal dunes. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its compact growth habit and attractive foliage."
