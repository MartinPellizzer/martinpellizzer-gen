    "intro": "Zoysia \u00d7 hondana, commonly known as the hybrid zoysia grass, is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Zoysia japonica and Zoysia matrella. It exhibits a dense, fine-textured turf that is highly valued for its durability and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green color, and it forms a mat-like growth pattern that suppresses weed growth. It is commonly used in lawns and sports fields due to its tolerance to heat and moderate foot traffic. However, it does not produce seeds and is typically propagated through sod or plugs."
