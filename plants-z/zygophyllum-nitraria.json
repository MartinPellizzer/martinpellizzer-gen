    "intro": "Zygophyllum nitraria, commonly known as the desert raisin or saltbush, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and fleshy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant is adapted to high salinity and drought conditions, making it a common species in saline soils. Its leaves and stems are sometimes used in traditional medicine for their anti-inflammatory properties. Zygophyllum nitraria plays an important ecological role by stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
