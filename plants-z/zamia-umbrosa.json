    "intro": "Zamia umbrosa, commonly known as the dark zamia, is a species of cycad native to the humid forests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and a crown of stiff, dark green, strap-like leaves. The plant produces small, cone-like structures called strobila, which contain both male and female reproductive organs. Zamia umbrosa thrives in shaded, moist environments and is adapted to low-light conditions. Its unique morphology and slow growth rate make it a distinctive and valuable component of tropical ecosystems."
