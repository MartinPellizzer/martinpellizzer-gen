    "intro": "Zanthoxylum hamadryadicum, commonly known as the African prickly ash, is a shrub or small tree native to parts of Africa. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often pinnately arranged and have a rough, textured surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by bright red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife. Zanthoxylum hamadryadicum is typically found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid conditions. Its thorny stems and medicinal properties have made it of interest in traditional herbal practices."
