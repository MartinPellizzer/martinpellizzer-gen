    "intro": "Zyrphelis, commonly known as the golden crownbeard, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. It is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its showy, yellow-orange ray flowers that resemble a crown, surrounded by a dense cluster of smaller, tubular florets. Zyrphelis species are typically herbaceous perennials, with hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. They are often found in rocky soils and are adapted to full sun, making them drought-tolerant and suitable for xeriscaping."
