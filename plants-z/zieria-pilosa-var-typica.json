    "intro": "Zieria pilosa var. typica, commonly known as the hairy zieria, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southeastern Australia. It typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, often in heathlands or open forests. The plant features small, ovate leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, arranged in clusters, and it produces small, round berries that are edible but not particularly palatable. Zieria pilosa var. typica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its compact form and seasonal flowering."
