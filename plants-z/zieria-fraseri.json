    "intro": "Zieria fraseri, commonly known as the Fraser's zieria, is a small, evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southeastern Australia. It typically grows to a height of about 1 meter and features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are dark green and glossy. The plant produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers during the spring and early summer months. These flowers are followed by small, red or purple berries that are edible but not particularly palatable. Zieria fraseri is well adapted to sandy soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal dunes."
