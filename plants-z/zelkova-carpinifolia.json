    "intro": "Zelkova carpinifolia, commonly known as the European zelkova, is a deciduous tree native to southern Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the family Celtidaceae and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged fruits that disperse by wind. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age, and it is often found in moist, well-drained soils. Zelkova carpinifolia is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in traditional medicine."
