    "intro": "Zea mays var. polyleuca, commonly known as the white corn or flour corn, is a variant of maize characterized by its pale yellow to white kernels. This plant is typically shorter and stockier than other maize varieties, with a shorter stalk and smaller ears. Its kernels are primarily used for grinding into flour due to their soft texture and high starch content. The plant has a similar growth cycle to other maize species, including germination, vegetative growth, and reproductive stages. It is cultivated in various regions for both culinary and agricultural purposes."
