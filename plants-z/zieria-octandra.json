    "intro": "Zieria octandra, commonly known as the broad-leaf zieria, is a flowering plant native to southeastern Australia. It belongs to the family Epacridaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered white or pinkish flowers. The plant typically grows in heathlands and rocky areas, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are narrow and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Zieria octandra is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
