    "intro": "Ziziphora graveolens, commonly known as sweet woodruff, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It features aromatic, fragrant leaves that emit a distinctive, pleasant scent, particularly when crushed. The plant produces small, pale blue to white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early summer. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense mats in moist, shaded environments. Ziziphora graveolens is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal medicine."
