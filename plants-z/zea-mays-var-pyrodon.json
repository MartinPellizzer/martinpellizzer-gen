    "intro": "Zea mays var. pyrodon, commonly known as the fire corn or pyrodon corn, is a variant of maize characterized by its distinctive red and orange-colored kernels. This plant belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is native to the Americas, particularly Mexico. The striking coloration of its grains is due to high levels of carotenoids, which also contribute to its nutritional value. It is often cultivated for ornamental purposes as well as for its unique flavor profile in culinary applications. The plant typically grows to a height of 2 to 4 meters and thrives in warm, sunny climates with well-drained soil."
