    "intro": "Zygopetalum obtusatum, commonly known as the blunt-lobed zygopetalum, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow and orange. The plant features pleated, strap-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to thrive in well-draining, humus-rich soil. Zygopetalum obtusatum is prized in horticulture for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
