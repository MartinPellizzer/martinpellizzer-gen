    "intro": "Zygosepalum, commonly known as the false orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring a fused sepal that forms a single, elongated structure called a zygosepal. These plants are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing as epiphytes on trees or as terrestrial plants in moist environments. The flowers are usually small and showy, with a variety of colors, and they often have a sweet fragrance to attract pollinators. Zygosepalum species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are commonly cultivated in greenhouses and gardens."
