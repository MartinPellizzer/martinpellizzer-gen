    "intro": "Zeltnera calycosa, commonly known as the desert mallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its flowers are typically arranged in clusters and are adapted for pollination by insects. Zeltnera calycosa is often found in rocky soils and can thrive in full sun, making it a hardy species suited to desert conditions."
