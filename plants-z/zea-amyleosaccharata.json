    "intro": "Zea amyleosaccharata, commonly known as the sweet grass, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, blade-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of many grasses. Its roots are fibrous and form dense mats, which help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Zea amyleosaccharata is often found in moist, open habitats such as wet meadows and stream banks."
