    "intro": "Zamia cylindrica, commonly known as the cylindrical cycad, is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is native to Mexico. It is a dioecious plant, meaning it has separate male and female plants, and produces cones rather than flowers. The plant features a stout, unbranched trunk with a crown of pinnate, feather-like leaves. Its leaves are typically dark green and can grow up to several feet in length. Zamia cylindrica is adapted to arid environments and requires well-drained soil and full sun to thrive."
