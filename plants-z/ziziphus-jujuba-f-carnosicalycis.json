    "intro": "Ziziphus jujuba f. carnosicalycis, commonly known as the fleshycalyx jujube, is a cultivar of the jujube tree characterized by its distinctive, thickened floral bracts. This variant exhibits a unique botanical feature where the calyx remains fleshy and enlarged, often resembling a small fruit itself. The plant is native to China and thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil. Its leaves are ovate and dark green, while the fruit is typically smaller and sweeter than standard jujubes. This cultivar is valued for both ornamental purposes and its edible fruit, which is rich in nutrients."
