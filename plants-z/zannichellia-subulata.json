It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in width. The plant forms dense underwater mats, often found in still or slow-moving waters such as ponds and lakes. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or white, emerging from the water surface.
