    "intro": "Zimmermanniopsis uzungwaensis, commonly known as the Uzungwa dwarf heather, is a flowering plant native to the Uzungwa Mountains in Tanzania. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with small, evergreen leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which bloom during the rainy season. Zimmermanniopsis uzungwaensis is adapted to rocky and acidic soils, often found in montane forest habitats. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
