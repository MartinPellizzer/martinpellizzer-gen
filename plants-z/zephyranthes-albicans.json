    "intro": "Zephyranthes albicans, commonly known as the white rainflower, is a species of flowering plant native to the southeastern United States and parts of Mexico. It is a bulbous perennial that produces showy, white, star-shaped flowers during the late summer and early fall. The plant is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and its ability to thrive in well-drained sandy soils. It is often found in open, sunny habitats such as prairies and coastal dunes. Zephyranthes albicans is also known for its ability to bloom after rainfall, hence its common name."
