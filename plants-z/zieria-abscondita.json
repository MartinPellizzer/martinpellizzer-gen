    "intro": "Zieria abscondita, commonly known as the hidden zieria, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the coastal regions of southeastern Australia. It belongs to the family Epacridaceae and is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces tiny, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which bloom in spring. Zieria abscondita thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in heathlands and coastal forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
