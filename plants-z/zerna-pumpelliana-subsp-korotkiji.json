    "intro": "Zerna pumpelliana subsp. korotkiji, commonly known as the Korotkij's zerna, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific alpine regions. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The flowers are typically pale green to yellowish, with a delicate structure adapted for wind pollination. This subspecies thrives in nutrient-poor soils and requires a cool, moist environment to flourish. Its botanical features reflect its evolutionary adaptation to harsh mountainous habitats."
