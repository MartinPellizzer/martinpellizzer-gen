    "intro": "Zanthoxylum elegans, commonly known as the elegant prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Rutaceae family, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its compound leaves and clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces red, berry-like fruits that are edible for some wildlife but are generally considered toxic to humans. Its bark and leaves have been used in traditional medicine for their purported antiseptic and analgesic properties. Zanthoxylum elegans thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas along stream banks."
