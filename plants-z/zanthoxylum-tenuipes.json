    "intro": "Zanthoxylum tenuipes, commonly known as the narrowleaf prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, often thorned branches and pinnately compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into red, fleshy berries, which are an important food source for various wildlife species. Zanthoxylum tenuipes is adapted to a variety of soil types but thrives in well-drained, acidic conditions. Its ornamental value and ecological importance make it a notable species in native plant gardens and natural habitats."
