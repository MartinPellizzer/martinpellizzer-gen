    "intro": "Zahlbrucknera repens, commonly known as the creeping Zahlbrucknera, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a water-holding structure. The plant produces striking, showy inflorescences with brightly colored bracts that attract pollinators. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its ornamental value and unique growth habit, it is occasionally cultivated in tropical botanical gardens."
