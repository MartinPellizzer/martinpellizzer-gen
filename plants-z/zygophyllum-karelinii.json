    "intro": "Zygophyllum karelinii, commonly known as the desert morning glory, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Central Asia. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its small, pale yellow to reddish flowers that bloom in the early morning. The plant has small, narrow leaves and produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds. It is well adapted to dry environments, with deep roots and a waxy coating on its leaves to reduce water loss. Zygophyllum karelinii plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and is often found in desert and semi-desert habitats."
