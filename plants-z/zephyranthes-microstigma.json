    "intro": "Zephyranthes microstigma, commonly known as the lesser rainflower, is a species of flowering plant in the Amaryllidaceae family. It is native to the southeastern United States, particularly Florida, and thrives in wetland and marsh environments. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in response to rainfall, typically in late summer or early autumn. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it has a short, rhizomatous stem. Zephyranthes microstigma is often found in association with other aquatic or semi-aquatic plants in its native habitat."
