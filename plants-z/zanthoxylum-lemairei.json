    "intro": "Zanthoxylum lemairei, commonly known as the Vietnamese prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and have serrated margins. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for some birds and mammals. Zanthoxylum lemairei is often found in moist, shaded areas of forests and is valued for its ornamental and medicinal properties. Its bark and leaves contain compounds used in traditional medicine for their anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects."
