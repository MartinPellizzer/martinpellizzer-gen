It belongs to the Zingiberaceae family, which includes other well-known gingers such as turmeric and cardamom. The plant is characterized by its ornate, fragrant inflorescence and striking, colorful bracts that range from red to orange. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest for botanists and horticulturists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution.
