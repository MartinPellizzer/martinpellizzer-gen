    "intro": "Zizania aquatica, commonly known as wild rice, is a perennial aquatic grass native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada. It thrives in shallow freshwater habitats such as marshes, lakes, and slow-moving rivers. The plant produces long, cylindrical spikes of small, rice-like seeds that are an important food source for waterfowl and other wildlife. Its rhizomes form dense underground networks that help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Zizania aquatica is also valued for its historical and cultural significance to indigenous communities."
