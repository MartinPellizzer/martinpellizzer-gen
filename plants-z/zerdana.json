    "intro": "Zerdana, commonly known as the \"Egyptian milkweed,\" is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the genus Sida and is characterized by its palmate leaves and small, pale yellow flowers. The plant produces fluffy, white seed pods that release tiny seeds with silky hairs, aiding in wind dispersal. Zerdana is often found growing along roadsides and in disturbed soils, thriving in full sun. It has historical uses in traditional medicine and is valued for its ornamental appeal."
