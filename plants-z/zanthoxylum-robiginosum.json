    "intro": "Zanthoxylum robiginosum, commonly known as the red prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often divided into three to five oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into red, fleshy berries. Its bark and twigs are covered in sharp, stiff spines, which serve as a defense mechanism. Zanthoxylum robiginosum is often found in moist, wooded areas and is valued for its ornamental and medicinal properties."
