    "intro": "Zanthoxylum acutifolium, commonly known as the prickly ash or white prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 5 to 9 pairs of oval-shaped leaflets with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for some wildlife but toxic to humans. Its bark and berries contain compounds used in traditional medicine for their analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties. Zanthoxylum acutifolium thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
