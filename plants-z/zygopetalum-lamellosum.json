    "intro": "Zygopetalum lamellosum, commonly known as the lace orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is characterized by its intricate, lace-like petals and a distinctive floral structure that sets it apart from other orchid species. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree bark in its natural habitat. Its flowers are usually a mix of white and pink, with a subtle fragrance that attracts pollinators. Zygopetalum lamellosum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and relatively easy care requirements."
