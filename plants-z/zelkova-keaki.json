    "intro": "Zelkova keaki, commonly known as the Keaiki zelkova, is a species of flowering plant in the family Ulmaceae. It is native to the island of Kauai in Hawaii and is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves with a smooth, glossy surface. The tree produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers that are followed by small, round fruits containing a single seed. It is a slow-growing tree that can reach heights of up to 20 meters, with a broad, spreading crown. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Zelkova keaki is considered a rare and endangered species."
