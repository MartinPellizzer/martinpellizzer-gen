    "intro": "Zornia nervata, commonly known as the slender zornia, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils and thrives in partial to full shade. Its seed pods are linear and contain several small, round seeds that are dispersed by wind. Zornia nervata plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in woodland understories."
