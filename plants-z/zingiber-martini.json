    "intro": "Zingiber martini, commonly known as the ginger plant, is a tropical herbaceous plant native to Southeast Asia. It features a rhizome, which is the underground stem that stores nutrients and is the primary part used for culinary and medicinal purposes. The plant has long, narrow leaves that are typically green with a slight sheen, and it produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. Zingiber martini thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its rhizome is widely used in cooking, traditional medicine, and as a source of essential oils."
