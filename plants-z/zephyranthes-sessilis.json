    "intro": "Zephyranthes sessilis, commonly known as the pink hurricane lily, is a species of flowering plant native to the southeastern United States and parts of Mexico. It is a bulbous perennial that produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of pink, white, and yellow. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, often following thunderstorms, which is why it is also called the \"storm lily.\" Its leaves are strap-like and evergreen, and the plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun. Zephyranthes sessilis is valued for its ornamental beauty and adaptability to various garden conditions."
