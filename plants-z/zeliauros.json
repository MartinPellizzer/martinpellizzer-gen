    "intro": "Zeliauros, commonly known as the golden mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. Zeliauros is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
