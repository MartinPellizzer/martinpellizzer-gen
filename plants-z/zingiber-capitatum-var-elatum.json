It is characterized by its tall, robust stems that can reach up to 3 meters in height, supporting large, sword-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer, followed by edible, fleshy rhizomes. Its rhizomes are widely used in traditional medicine and as a spice due to their pungent aroma and medicinal properties. This variety is valued for both its ornamental appeal and culinary applications."
