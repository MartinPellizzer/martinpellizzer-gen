    "intro": "Zostera capensis f. elatior, commonly known as the greater sea grass, is a variant of the sea grass species native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. This plant is characterized by its long, ribbon-like leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in length, adapted for life in shallow, brackish or marine environments. It forms dense underwater meadows that provide critical habitat and shelter for a variety of marine organisms. The plant is submerged for most of the year, with its rhizomes anchoring it to the seabed. Zostera capensis f. elatior plays an important role in coastal ecosystems by stabilizing sediments and supporting biodiversity."
