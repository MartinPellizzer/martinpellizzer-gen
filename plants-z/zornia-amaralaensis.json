    "intro": "Zornia amaralaensis, commonly known as the yellow zornia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect, annual growth habit. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, which are often mistaken for a single flower. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a rough texture, while its seeds are enclosed in small, hairy pods. Zornia amaralaensis is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy species found in disturbed soils and open habitats."
