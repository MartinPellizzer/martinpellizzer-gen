    "intro": "Zygophyllum retrofractum, commonly known as the desert morning glory, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of 30 to 60 centimeters, featuring woody stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces showy, funnel-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often blooming in the early morning. Its adaptability to harsh environments makes it a resilient species in desert ecosystems. Zygophyllum retrofractum is also known for its ability to thrive with minimal water, making it a valuable plant for xeriscaping and ecological restoration projects."
