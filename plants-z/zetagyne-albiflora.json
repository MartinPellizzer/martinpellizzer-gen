    "intro": "Zetagyne albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered zetagyne, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has small, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along its slender stems. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forested areas with well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Zetagyne albiflora is considered a vulnerable species."
