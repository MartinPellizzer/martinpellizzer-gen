    "intro": "Zerna ramosa, commonly known as the branched zerna, is a perennial herb native to temperate regions of Asia. It features a slender, upright stem that often branches profusely, giving it a bushy appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in spike-like clusters, which bloom in early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a slightly hairy surface. Zerna ramosa is valued in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and digestive properties."
