    "intro": "Zygophyllum fontanesii, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub or subshrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, showcasing adaptations to harsh desert environments. The plant produces small, yellow or greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are usually small, scale-like, and often covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss. Zygophyllum fontanesii is well-suited to drought conditions and plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils in its native habitat."
