    "intro": "Zelkova, commonly known as the horse chestnut, is a genus of deciduous trees native to the temperate regions of Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves, which are often deeply lobed, and its showy, spikelike inflorescences that produce pale yellow flowers in spring. The fruit is a spiny capsule containing one or more chestnut-like seeds. Zelkova species are valued for their ornamental appeal, shade tolerance, and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. They also play an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
