It is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its upright growth habit, trifoliate leaves, and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. Zornia trachycarpa produces pods that are covered in rough, bristly hairs, giving it its common name. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing forage for wildlife and contributing to soil stabilization."
