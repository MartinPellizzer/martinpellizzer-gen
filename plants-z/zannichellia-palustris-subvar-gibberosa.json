    "intro": "Zannichellia palustris subvar. gibberosa, commonly known as the broad-leaved water plantain, is a aquatic plant characterized by its broad, arrow-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating. It typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds, ditches, and wet meadows. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense spikes, which emerge above the water surface. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize the sediment in aquatic environments. This subvariety is often found in nutrient-rich waters and can form dense mats that provide habitat for various aquatic organisms."
