    "intro": "Zea vulgaris, commonly known as corn or maize, is a tall annual grass native to the Americas. It produces large, tassel-like inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, with the female flowers developing into the edible kernels. The plant's leaves are broad and blade-like, and its stalks are sturdy, supporting the heavy weight of the ears. Zea vulgaris is a member of the Poaceae family and has been a staple crop for indigenous peoples for thousands of years. Its botanical significance extends beyond food, as it is also used in biofuel production and as a model organism in genetic research."
