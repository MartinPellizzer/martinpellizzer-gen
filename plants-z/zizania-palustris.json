    "intro": "Zizania palustris, commonly known as wild rice, is a perennial aquatic grass native to the eastern United States. It thrives in shallow freshwater environments such as marshes, lakes, and slow-moving rivers. The plant produces long, narrow leaves and develops spikelets that contain edible, nutrient-rich grains. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to form dense colonies that stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife. Zizania palustris plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems and has been used by Indigenous peoples for centuries as a food source."
