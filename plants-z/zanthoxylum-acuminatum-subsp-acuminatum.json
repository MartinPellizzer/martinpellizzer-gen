    "intro": "Zanthoxylum acuminatum subsp. acuminatum, commonly known as the prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are opposite and typically have 5 to 9 leaflets, each with a distinctive glandular tip. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for birds and small mammals. Its bark and leaves contain compounds such as alkaloids and lignans, which have been studied for their potential medicinal properties. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas along streams and in wetlands."
