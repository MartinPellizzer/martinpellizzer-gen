    "intro": "Zingiber eborinum, commonly known as the Eborinum ginger, is a rare and ornamental plant native to the highlands of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Zingiberaceae family, which includes gingers and related plants. The plant features broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often a vibrant green, with striking red and yellow inflorescences that bloom in late summer. Its rhizomes are not typically used for culinary purposes but are appreciated for their ornamental value in gardens. Zingiber eborinum thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
