    "intro": "Zeydora, commonly known as the golden sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, helping it conserve moisture in its harsh environment. Zeydora thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping. Its striking appearance and low maintenance requirements make it a popular ornamental plant in drought-tolerant gardens."
