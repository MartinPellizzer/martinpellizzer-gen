    "intro": "Zanthoxylum borbonicum, commonly known as the Madagascar prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 5 to 9 pairs of ovate to lanceolate leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in axillary inflorescences, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for some animals. Zanthoxylum borbonicum is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for study in both horticulture and ethnobotany."
