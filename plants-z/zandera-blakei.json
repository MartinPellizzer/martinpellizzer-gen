    "intro": "Zandera blakei, commonly known as Blake's zandera, is a deciduous tree native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America. It belongs to the Oliniaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and lanceolate leaves with a glossy upper surface. The tree produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by elongated, woody fruits containing flat, winged seeds. It is valued for its durable, heavy timber, which is used in construction and furniture-making. Due to habitat loss, Zandera blakei is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
