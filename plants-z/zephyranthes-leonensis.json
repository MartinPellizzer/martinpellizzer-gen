    "intro": "Zephyranthes leonensis, commonly known as the Leon's rain lily, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the Caribbean and northern South America. It produces striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which bloom in response to rainfall. The plant features strap-like, grassy leaves that are narrow and pointed, often growing in a rosette formation. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires a period of dormancy to produce flowers. Zephyranthes leonensis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to bloom in wet seasons."
