It is a member of the Rutaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces berries that are typically red or yellow when ripe, and it has thorny branches that are a distinguishing feature. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
