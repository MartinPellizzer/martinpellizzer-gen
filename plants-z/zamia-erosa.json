    "intro": "Zamia erosa, commonly known as the creeping cycad, is a species native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Zamiaceae family and is characterized by its underground stem and dense, grass-like foliage. The plant produces cycad-like cones, with male and female cones typically growing on separate plants. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, humid environments. Due to its slow growth and unique morphology, it is a popular specimen in botanical gardens and conservation efforts."
