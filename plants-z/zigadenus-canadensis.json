    "intro": "Zigadenus canadensis, commonly known as Canadian death camis, is a toxic plant native to North America. It belongs to the family Melanthiaceae and is characterized by its erect, herbaceous stems and showy, bell-shaped flowers. The plant produces a milky, poisonous sap that contains various toxic alkaloids, making it highly dangerous to both animals and humans. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often mistaken for other similar plants, which contributes to its accidental ingestion. Zigadenus canadensis is typically found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands."
