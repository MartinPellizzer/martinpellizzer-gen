    "intro": "Zanthoxylum calcicola, commonly known as the limestone prickly ash, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, particularly in limestone soils, which contribute to its common name. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring. Its fruits are red, fleshy berries that mature in the fall and are an important food source for wildlife. Zanthoxylum calcicola is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
