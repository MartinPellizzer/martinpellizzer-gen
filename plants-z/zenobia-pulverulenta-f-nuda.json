    "intro": "Zenobia pulverulenta f. nuda, commonly known as the naked sand verbena, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, pale blue or violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. This variety is notable for its compact growth habit and drought tolerance, making it well-suited for xeriscaping."
