    "intro": "Zamia laeta, commonly known as the golden cycad, is a member of the Zamiaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of South America. It is a slow-growing, evergreen plant characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnate leaves that are often a striking golden-green color. The plant produces cycad-like cones, with male and female cones on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. Zamia laeta is adapted to grow in well-drained, sandy soils and requires a warm, humid climate to thrive. Due to its ornamental value and slow growth, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in tropical and subtropical gardens."
