    "intro": "Zexmenia longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed zexmenia, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its slender, woody stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, often clustered in inflorescences. Zexmenia longipes is known for its slow growth and preference for humid, shaded environments, making it a challenging species to cultivate outside its native habitat. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and potential ecological role in its native ecosystem."
