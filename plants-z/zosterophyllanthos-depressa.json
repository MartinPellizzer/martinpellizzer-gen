    "intro": "Zosterophyllanthos depressa, commonly known as the low-growing zosterophyllum, is a rare and specialized plant species found in specific coastal habitats. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth pattern and small, strap-like leaves that are adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds. The plant belongs to the order Zosterophyllales, which is closely related to early land plants, suggesting evolutionary ties to ancient flora. Its reproductive structures are simple and consist of small, inconspicuous flowers that produce lightweight seeds for wind dispersal. Due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity, Zosterophyllanthos depressa is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
