It is characterized by its dense, aromatic wood that is highly valued for its durability and scent. The plant has compound leaves with elongated leaflets and produces small, fragrant flowers that attract pollinators. Its fruit is a woody capsule containing several seeds. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species in its natural habitat."
