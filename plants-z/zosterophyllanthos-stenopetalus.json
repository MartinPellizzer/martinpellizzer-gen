It belongs to the order Zosterophyllales, which includes some of the earliest known land plants. The plant exhibits a simple, branching structure with small, scale-like leaves. Its reproductive structures are distinctive, featuring specialized organs that suggest a transition from aquatic to terrestrial life. Zosterophyllanthos stenopetalus is primarily found in moist, shaded environments and is of great interest to paleobotanists."
