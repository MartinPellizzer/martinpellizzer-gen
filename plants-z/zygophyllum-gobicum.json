    "intro": "Zygophyllum gobicum, commonly known as the desert morning glory, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It is a low-growing shrub with small, fleshy leaves adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the early morning, hence its common name. Its root system is extensive and deep, allowing it to access groundwater in dry conditions. Zygophyllum gobicum plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
