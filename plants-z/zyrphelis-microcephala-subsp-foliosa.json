    "intro": "Zyrphelis microcephala subsp. foliosa, commonly known as the leafy zyrphelis, is a flowering plant species native to the Andean region of South America. It belongs to the family Polemoniaceae and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, tubular flowers. The subspecies is distinguished by its broader, more foliaceous (leaf-like) bracts compared to the typical form. It thrives in high-altitude environments, often found in moist, shaded areas within cloud forests. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in specialized gardens."
