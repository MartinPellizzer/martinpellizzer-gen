    "intro": "Zygophyllum capense, commonly known as the Cape gooseberry or yellow burr bush, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid regions, characterized by its woody stems and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain seeds covered in a sticky, resinous substance. Zygophyllum capense is adapted to survive in harsh environments, with deep root systems and reduced leaf surface to minimize water loss. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for various insects and small animals."
