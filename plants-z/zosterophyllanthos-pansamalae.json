It belongs to the order Zosterophyllophyta, which includes some of the earliest known land plants. The plant exhibits a distinctive morphology with a branching, ribbon-like structure and specialized reproductive organs. Its leaves are typically narrow and arranged in a spiral pattern, contributing to its prehistoric appearance. Due to its limited distribution and fragile nature, it is of significant interest to botanists studying early plant evolution."
