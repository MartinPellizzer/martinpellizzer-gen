    "intro": "Zornia dyctiocarpa, commonly known as the hairy zornia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in desert or semi-desert environments. Its seed pods are distinctive, being hairy and twisted, which aids in seed dispersal. Zornia dyctiocarpa is a low-growing perennial that plays a role in stabilizing soil in arid regions."
