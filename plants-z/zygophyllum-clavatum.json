    "intro": "Zygophyllum clavatum, commonly known as the sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia and Africa. It is a low-growing shrub with small, fleshy leaves adapted to conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access moisture from deeper soil layers. Zygophyllum clavatum is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is considered an important component of desert ecosystems."
