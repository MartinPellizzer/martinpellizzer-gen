    "intro": "Zygophyllum coccineum var. berenicense, commonly known as the red sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that produces vibrant red or orange flowers during the spring and summer months. The plant has small, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in its dry habitat. Its flowers are typically clustered in dense inflorescences, and the plant is adapted to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils. Zygophyllum coccineum var. berenicense is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
