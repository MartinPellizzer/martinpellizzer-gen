    "intro": "Zygophyllum microcarpum, commonly known as the small-fruited sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Zygophyllaceae, which includes plants adapted to harsh, dry environments. The plant is characterized by its low-growing, sprawling habit with small, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss. Its flowers are typically yellow or pale green, and it produces small, dry fruits that contain seeds. Zygophyllum microcarpum plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and is often found in desert ecosystems."
