    "intro": "Zelkova cretica, commonly known as the Greek ironwood, is a deciduous tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and smooth, gray bark that develops deep fissures with age. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are followed by winged fruits. Zelkova cretica is valued for its hard, durable wood and is often used in traditional crafts and construction. It thrives in well-drained soils and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
