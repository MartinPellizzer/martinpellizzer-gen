    "intro": "Zea mays convar. aorista, commonly known as the wild maize or teosinte, is a wild relative of modern corn. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and the presence of multiple branches, which distinguish it from cultivated maize. The plant typically has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences with spikelets. Its seeds are enclosed in hard, dry pericarps, and the plant is adapted to a variety of environmental conditions. This species plays an important role in the genetic diversity of maize and is studied for its potential in breeding programs."
