It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of pink to white. The plant is adapted to grow in well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. It blooms in the spring and summer, often following rainfall, hence its common name. Zephyranthes xiphopetala is a popular choice for rock gardens and borders due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
