    "intro": "Zschokkea utilis, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a tropical aquatic plant native to South America. It is characterized by its large, floating fronds that can grow up to 3 meters in length. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often forming dense mats on the water surface. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, anchoring the plant and facilitating vegetative propagation. Zschokkea utilis plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and contributing to water filtration."
