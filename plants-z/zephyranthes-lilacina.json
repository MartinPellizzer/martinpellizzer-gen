It is a herbaceous perennial that produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to purple. The plant typically blooms in response to rainfall, hence its common name, and is often found in wetlands and moist soils. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are evergreen in warmer climates. Zephyranthes lilacina is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in wet conditions."
